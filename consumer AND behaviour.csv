The use of PLS in the field of operations management is also growing. However, questions still exist among some operations management researchers regarding whether and how PLS should be used. To address these questions, our study provides a practical guideline for using PLS and uses examples from the operations management literature to demonstrate how the specific points in this guideline can be applied. In addition, our study reviews and summarizes the use of PLS in the recent operations management literature according to our guideline. The main contribution of this study is to present a practical guideline for evaluating and using PLS that is tailored to the operations management field. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Empirical research methods; Operations management; Partial least squares (PLS); Structural equation modeling (SEM)","Research; Business research; Empirical research method; Operations management; Partial least square (PLS); Practical guidelines; Structural equation modeling; Management","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84865640523"

We assume that a person's reference point is her rational expectations held in the recent past about outcomes, which are determined in a personal equilibrium by the requirement that they must be consistent with optimal behavior given expectations. In deterministic environments, choices maximize consumption utility, but gain-loss utility influences behavior when there is uncertainty. Applying the model to consumer behavior, we show that willingness to pay for a good is increasing in the expected probability of purchase and in the expected prices conditional on purchase.

In spite of the general use of love-of-variety models, there has been no systematic study of how the import of new varieties has contributed to national welfare gains in the United States. In this paper we show that the unmeasured growth in product variety from U. S. imports has been an important source of gains from trade over the last three decades (1972-2001). Using extremely disaggregated data, we show that the number of imported product varieties has increased by a factor of three. We also estimate the elasticities of substitution for each available category at the same level of aggregation, and describe their behavior across time and SITC industries. Using these estimates, we develop an exact aggregate price index and find that the upward bias in the conventional import price index over this time period was 28 percent or 1.2 percentage points per year. We estimate the value to U. S. consumers of the expanded import varieties between 1972 and 2001 to be 2.6 percent of GDP. © 2006 by the President and Fellows of Harvard College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-33646346104"

From a managerial perspective, sensory marketing can be used to create subconscious triggers that characterize consumer perceptions of abstract notions of the product (e.g., its sophistication or quality). Given the gamut of explicit marketing appeals made to consumers every day, subconscious triggers which appeal to the basic senses may be a more efficient way to engage consumers. Also, these sensory triggers may result in consumers' self-generation of (desirable) brand attributes, rather than those verbally provided by the advertiser. The understanding of these sensory triggers implies an understanding of sensation and perception as it applies to consumer behavior-this is the research perspective of sensory marketing. This review article presents an overview of research on sensory perception. The review also points out areas where little research has been done, so that each additional paper has a greater chance of making a bigger difference and sparking further research. It is quite apparent from the review that there still remains tremendous need for research within the domain of sensory marketing-research that can be very impactful. © 2011 Society for Consumer Psychology.","Embodied cognition; Grounded cognition; Sensory marketing; Smell; Taste; Touch","","Review","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84863089016"

Using research on information processing as a foundation, we suggest that in the context of an online community, reviewer disclosure of identity-descriptive information is used by consumers to supplement or replace product information when making purchase decisions and evaluating the helpfulness of online reviews. Using a unique data set based on both chronologically compiled ratings as well as reviewer characteristics for a given set of products and geographical location-based purchasing behavior from Amazon, we provide evidence that community norms are an antecedent to reviewer disclosure of identity-descriptive information. Online community members rate reviews containing identity-descriptive information more positively, and the prevalence of reviewer disclosure of identity information is associated with increases in subsequent online product sales. In addition, we show that shared geographical location increases the relationship between disclosure and product sales, thus highlighting the important role of geography in electronic commerce. Taken together, our results suggest that identity-relevant information about reviewers shapes community members′ judgment of products and reviews. Implications for research on the relationship between online word-of-mouth (WOM) and sales, peer recognition and reputation systems, and conformity to online community norms are discussed. © 2008 INFORMS.","Digital markets; Identity disclosure; Information processing; Internet retailing; Online reviews; Social identity; User-generated content; Virtual communities","Commerce; Data processing; Electronic commerce; Sales; Social networking (online); Virtual reality; Digital markets; Identity disclosure; Internet retailing; Online reviews; Social identity; User-generated content; Virtual community; Online systems","Review","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-48449101733"

The authors show that qualifying products and positioning goods are major concerns for agents evolving within the 'economy of qualities'. Competition in such an economy is structured through two basic mechanisms. The first is what the authors propose to call the process of singularization of products. The second is the mechanism whereby consumers are attached to, and detached from, goods that are proposed to them. At the heart of these logics, one can find multiple socio-technical devices that are designed by economic agents, which ensure the distribution of cognitive competencies, and which constantly and finely tune supply and demand. Relying upon Jean Gadrey's work, the authors claim that the economy of qualities is nowhere more effective than in services providing activities, and especially in those sectors that invest heavily in New Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs). Finally, the authors suggest that, in the economy of qualities, the functioning and the organization of markets are issues that are shared by scholars and actors. In these highly reflexive markets, a collaboration between them is needed.","Economy; Markets; Quality; Services","competition (economics); consumption behavior; information technology; service sector; theoretical study","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0036093691"

On the basis of the cognition-affect-behavior model, the authors hypothesize that customer satisfaction mediates the relationship between customer value and customer loyalty, and that customer satisfaction and loyalty have significant reciprocal effects on each other. Furthermore, the potential interaction effect of satisfaction and switching costs, and the quadratic effect of satisfaction, on loyalty are explored. The authors test the hypotheses on data obtained from a courier service provider in a B2B context.

Often people's preferences are unclear and ill-formed, and their choices will inevitably be influenced by default rules, framing effects, and starting points. In these circumstances, a form of paternalism cannot be avoided. Equipped with an understanding of behavioral findings of bounded rationality and bounded self-control, libertarian paternalists should attempt to steer people's choices in welfare-promoting directions without eliminating freedom of choice. It is also possible to show how a libertarian paternalist might select among the possible options and to assess how much choice to offer.

The process is captured through firo online consumer behaviors: (1) getting information and (2) purchasing a product from a Web vendor. First, we simultaneously model the association between these two contingent online behaviors and their respective intentions by appealing to consumer behavior theories and the theory of implementation intentions, respectively. Second, following TPB, we derive for each behavior its intention, attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control (PBC). Third, we elicit and test a comprehensive set of salient beliefs for each behavior. A longitudinal study with online consumers supports the proposed e-commerce adoption model, validating the predictive power of TPB and the proposed conceptualization of PBC as a higher-order factor formed by self-efficacy and controllability. Our findings stress the importance of trust and technology adoption variables (perceived usefulness and ease of use) as salient beliefs for predicting e-commerce adoption, justifying the integration of trust and technology adoption variables within the TPB framework. In addition, technological characteristics (download delay, Website navigability, and information protection), consumer skills, time and monetary resources, and product characteristics (product diagnosticity and product value) add to the explanatory and predictive power of our model.

Drawing on the paradigm of search and experience goods from information economics, we develop and test a model of customer review helpfulness. An analysis of 1,587 reviews from Amazon.com across six products indicated that review extremity, review depth, and product type affect the perceived helpfulness of the review. Product type moderates the effect of review extremity on the helpfulness of the review. For experience goods, reviews with extreme ratings are less helpful than reviews with moderate ratings. For both product types, review depth has a positive effect on the helpfulness of the review, but the product type moderates the effect of review depth on the helpfulness of the review.

We collected primary data from 521 respondents as input, establishing validity through confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Our empirical results of structural equation modeling (SEM) show that extended TPB has higher predictability than TPB and TRA in green marketing settings. Consumer attitude and perceived behavioral control significantly predicts purchase intention whereas subjective norm does not. Our findings also suggest that TPB mediates the relationship between environmental concern and green products purchase intention. An additional construct in the new model considerably contributes to improving the understanding of green products purchase intention formation and could become a sustainable mainstream variable. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Consumer attitude; Environmental concern; Green products; Purchase intention; Structural equation modeling; Theory of Planned Behavior; Validity","India; attitudinal survey; consumption behavior; economic theory; factor analysis; marketing; model; prediction; sustainability; theoretical study","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84951336320"

An application that is becoming more common is the use of self-service technologies (SSTs), such as telephone banking, automated hotel checkout, and online investment trading, whereby customers produce services for themselves without assistance from firm employees. Widespread introduction of SSTs is apparent across industries, yet relatively little is known about why customers decide to try SSTs and why some SSTs are more widely accepted than others. In this research, the authors explore key factors that influence the initial SST trial decision, specifically focusing on actual behavior in situations in which the consumer has a choice among delivery modes. The authors show that the consumer readiness variables of role clarity, motivation, and ability are key mediators between established adoption constructs (innovation characteristics and individual differences) and the likelihood of trial.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-17544382395"

This article takes an in-depth look at when, why, and how CSR works from a consumer's perspective. In contrast to the simple, monotonic relationships between CSR and consumer purchase behavior evident in marketplace polls, this article proposes a more complex, contingent model of consumer responses to CSR. It articulates both the internal outcomes (e.g., awareness, attitudes, attachment) and external outcomes (e.g., word of mouth, purchase, loyalty) of CSR initiatives for not just the company, but also the consumer and the CSR issue/cause. This article delineates the key factors that are likely to moderate the extent to which the inputs lead to the internal outcomes and the internal outcomes lead to the external ones. This framework can help guide companies in not only formulating and implementing their CSR initiatives, but also measuring the effectiveness of these initiatives.","","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-10844233900"

The primary constructs for capturing consumer acceptance of e-commerce are intention to transact and on-line transaction behavior. Following the theory of reasoned action (TRA) as applied to a technology-driven environment, technology acceptance model (TAM) variables (perceived usefulness and ease of use) are posited as key drivers of e-commerce acceptance. The practical utility of TAM stems from the fact that e-commerce is technology-driven. The proposed model integrates trust and perceived risk, which are incorporated given the implicit uncertainty of the e-commerce environment. The proposed integration of the hypothesized independent variables is justified by placing all the variables under the nomological TRA structure and proposing their interrelationships. The resulting research model is tested using data from two empirical studies. The first, exploratory study comprises three experiential scenarios with 103 students. The second, confirmatory study uses a sample of 155 on-line consumers. Both studies strongly support the e-commerce acceptance model by validating the proposed hypotheses. The paper discusses the implications for e-commerce theory, research, and practice, and makes several suggestions for future research. Copyright © 2003 M.E. Sharpe, Inc.

A typology of trust types would make it easier to compare and communicate results, and would be especially valuable if the types of trust related to one other. The typology should be interdisciplinary because many disciplines research e-commerce. This paper justifies a parsimonious interdisciplinary typology and relates trust constructs to e-commerce consumer actions, defining both conceptual-level and operational-level trust constructs. Conceptual-level constructs consist of disposition to trust (primarily from psychology), institution-based trust (from sociology), and trusting beliefs and trusting intentions (primarily from social psychology). Each construct is decomposed into measurable subconstructs, and the typology shows how trust constructs relate to already existing Internet relationship constructs. The effects of Web vendor interventions on consumer behaviors are posited to be partially mediated by consumer trusting beliefs and trusting intentions in the e-vendor.","Customer relationships; Human issues in e-commerce; Internet consumers; Trust","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0037660095"

To develop an effective theory of relationship marketing, it is necessary to understand what motivates consumers to reduce their available market choices and engage in a relational market behavior by patronizing the same marketer in subsequent choice situations. This article draws on established consumer behavior literature to suggest that consumers engage in relational market behavior due to personal influences, social influences, and institutional influences. Consumers reduce their available choice and engage in relational market behavior because they want to simplify their buying and consuming tasks, simplify information processing, reduce perceived risks, and maintain cognitive consistency and a state of psychological comfort. They also engage in relational market behavior because of family and social norms, peer group pressures, government mandates, religious tenets, employer influences, and marketer policies. The willingness and ability of both consumers and marketers to engage in relational marketing will lead to greater marketing productivity, unless either consumers or marketers abuse the mutual interdependence and cooperation. © 1995, Academy of Marketing Science.

In this study, we integrate qualitative user-marketer interaction content data from a fan page brand community on Facebook and consumer transactions data to assemble a unique data set at the individual consumer level. We then quantify the impact of community contents from consumers (user-generated content, i.e., UGC) and marketers (marketer-generated content, i.e., MGC) on consumers' apparel purchase expenditures. A content analysis method was used to construct measures to capture the informative and persuasive nature of UGC and MGC while distinguishing between directed and undirected communication modes in the brand community. In our empirical analysis, we exploit differences across consumers' fan page joining decision and across timing differences in fan page joining dates for our model estimation and identification strategies. Importantly, we also control for potential self-selection biases and relevant factors such as pricing, promotion, social network attributes, consumer demographics, and unobserved heterogeneity. Our findings show that engagement in social media brand communities leads to a positive increase in purchase expenditures. Additional examinations of UGC and MGC impacts show evidence of social media contents affecting consumer purchase behavior through embedded information and persuasion. We also uncover the different roles played by UGC and MGC, which vary by the type of directed or undirected communication modes by consumers and the marketer. Specifically, the elasticities of demand with respect to UGC information richness are 0.006 (directed communication) and 3.140 (undirected communication), whereas those for MGC information richness are insignificant. Moreover, the UGC valence elasticity of demand is 0.180 (undirected communication), whereas that for MGC valence is 0.004 (directed communication). Overall, UGC exhibits a stronger impact than MGC on consumer purchase behavior. Our findings provide various implications for academic research and practice. © 2013 INFORMS.","Brand community; Communication mode; Conometric modeling; Consumer behavior; Marketer-generated content; Social media; Text mining; User-generated content","Commerce; Data mining; Economics; Elasticity; Joining; Marketing; Purchasing; Sales; Social networking (online); Brand community; Communication mode; Marketer-generated content; Social media; Text mining; User-generated content; Consumer behavior","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84877663273"

The program provides additional evidence that non-price interventions can substantially and cost effectively change consumer behavior: the effect is equivalent to that of a short-run electricity price increase of 11 to 20%, and the cost effectiveness compares favorably to that of traditional energy conservation programs. Perhaps because the treatment included descriptive social norms, effects are heterogeneous: households in the highest decile of pre-treatment consumption decrease usage by 6.3%, while consumption by the lowest decile decreases by only 0.3%.

We argue that buying such products can be construed as altruistic, since green products often cost more and are of lower quality than their conventional counterparts, but green goods benefit the environment for everyone. Because biologists have observed that altruism might function as a ""costly signal"" associated with status, we examined in 3 experiments how status motives influenced desire for green products. Activating status motives led people to choose green products over more luxurious nongreen products. Supporting the notion that altruism signals one's willingness and ability to incur costs for others' benefit, status motives increased desire for green products when shopping in public (but not private) and when green products cost more (but not less) than nongreen products. Findings suggest that status competition can be used to promote proenvironmental behavior. © 2010 American Psychological Association.","altruism; consumer behavior; costly signaling; environmental conservation; status competition","Adult; Consumer Participation; Environment; Female; Humans; Male; Motivation; Politics; Social Desirability; Social Responsibility; adult; article; consumer; environment; female; human; male; motivation; politics; social behavior; social desirability","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-77649158309"

Since it was formulated, many technological changes have dramatically affected the way we consume, present ourselves, and communicate. This conceptual update seeks to revitalize the concept, incorporate the impacts of digitization, and provide an understanding of consumer sense of self in today's technological environment. It is necessarily a work in progress, for the digital environment and our behavior within it continue to evolve. But some important changes are already clear. Five changes with digital consumption are considered that impact the nature of self and the nature of possessions. Needed modifications and additions to the extended self are outlined, and directions for future research are suggested. The digital world opens a host of new means for self-extension, using many new consumption objects to reach a vastly broader audience. Even though this calls for certain reformulations, the basic concept of the extended self remains vital. © 2013 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc.

Using U.S. quarterly stock market data, we find that these fluctuations in the consumption-wealth ratio are strong predictors of both real stock returns and excess returns over a Treasury bill rate. We also find that this variable is a better forecaster of future returns at short and intermediate horizons than is the dividend yield, the dividend payout ratio, and several other popular forecasting variables. Why should the consumption-wealth ratio forecast asset returns? We show that a wide class of optimal models of consumer behavior imply that the log consumption-aggregate wealth (human capital plus asset holdings) ratio summarizes expected returns on aggregate wealth, or the market portfolio. Although this ratio is not observable, we provide assumptions under which its important predictive components for future asset returns may be expressed in terms of observable variables, namely in terms of consumption, asset holdings and labor income. The framework implies that these variables are cointegrated, and that deviations from this shared trend summarize agents' expectations of future returns on the market portfolio.","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-0012462939"

Robotics in combination with rapidly improving technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), mobile, cloud, big data and biometrics will bring opportunities for a wide range of innovations that have the potential to dramatically change service industries. The purpose of this paper is to explore the potential role service robots will play in the future and to advance a research agenda for service researchers. Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses a conceptual approach that is rooted in the service, robotics and AI literature. Findings: The contribution of this paper is threefold. First, it provides a definition of service robots, describes their key attributes, contrasts their features and capabilities with those of frontline employees, and provides an understanding for which types of service tasks robots will dominate and where humans will dominate. Second, this paper examines consumer perceptions, beliefs and behaviors as related to service robots, and advances the service robot acceptance model. Third, it provides an overview of the ethical questions surrounding robot-delivered services at the individual, market and societal level. Practical implications: This paper helps service organizations and their management, service robot innovators, programmers and developers, and policymakers better understand the implications of a ubiquitous deployment of service robots. Originality/value: This is the first conceptual paper that systematically examines key dimensions of robot-delivered frontline service and explores how these will differ in the future. © 2018, Jochen Wirtz, Paul G.

But what drives interpersonal communication and why do people talk about certain things rather than others? This article argues that word of mouth is goal driven and serves five key functions (i.e., impression management, emotion regulation, information acquisition, social bonding, and persuasion). Importantly, I suggest these motivations are predominantly self- (rather than other) serving and drive what people talk about even without their awareness. Further, these drivers make predictions about the types of news and information people are most likely to discuss. This article reviews the five proposed functions and well as how contextual factors (i.e., audience and communication channel) may moderate which functions play a larger role. Taken together, the paper provides insight into the psychological factors that shape word of mouth and outlines additional questions that deserve further study. © 2014 Society for Consumer Psychology.","Social influence; Viral marketing; Word of mouth","","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84905730356"

Data were collected from 81 self-declared green consumers through in depth interviews on recent purchases of technology products. A green consumer purchasing model and success criteria for closing the gap between green consumers' values and their behaviour are developed.

It is seen by many commentators as the key to long-term success, with Albrecht (1992, p 7) arguing that ""the only thing that matters in the new world of quality is delivering customer value."" Despite this emphasis, little research has addressed the value construct itself and there is no well-accepted value measure, even in the retail environment in which customers evaluate products before purchase. The present research project describes the development of a 19-item measure, PERVAL, that can be used to assess customers' perceptions of the value of a consumer durable good at a brand level. The measure was developed for use in a retail purchase situation to determine what consumption values drive purchase attitude and behavior. Four distinct, value dimensions emerged that were termed emotional, social, quality/performance and price/value for money. The reliability and validity of the scale was assessed in a prepurchase situation, using exploratory and confirmatory analyses. All four value dimensions were found to help significantly in explaining attitudes and behavior. The scale was also tested in a postpurchase situation and found to be both reliable and valid in this context as well. The PERVAL scale has a variety of potential applications and can serve as a framework for further empirical research in this important area. © 2001 by New York University.

A unique characteristic of online shopping environments is that they allow vendors to create retail interfaces with highly interactive features. One desirable form of interactivity from a consumer perspective is the implementation of sophisticated tools to assist shoppers in their purchase decisions by customizing the electronic shopping environment to their individual preferences. The availability of such tools, which we refer to as interactive decision aids for consumers, may lead to a transformation of the way in which shoppers search for product information and make purchase decisions. The primary objective of this paper is to investigate the nature of the effects that interactive decision aids may have on consumer decision making in online shopping environments. While making purchase decisions, consumers are often unable to evaluate all available alternatives in great depth and, thus, tend to use two-stage processes to reach their decisions. At the first stage, consumers typically screen a large set of available products and identify a subset of the most promising alternatives. Subsequently, they evaluate the latter in more depth, perform relative comparisons across products on important attributes, and make a purchase decision. Given the different tasks to be performed in such a two-stage process, interactive tools that provide support to consumers in the following respects are particularly valuable: (1) the initial screening of available products to determine which ones are worth considering further, and (2) the in-depth comparison of selected products before making the actual purchase decision. This paper examines the effects of two decision aids, each designed to assist consumers in performing one of the above tasks, on purchase decision making in an online store. The first interactive tool, a recommendation agent (RA), allows consumers to more efficiently screen the (potentially very large) set of alternatives available in an online shopping environment. Based on self-explicated information about a consumer's own utility function (attribute importance weights and minimum acceptable attribute levels), the RA generates a personalized list of recommended alternatives. The second decision aid, a comparison matrix (CM), is designed to help consumers make in-depth comparisons among selected alternatives. The CM allows consumers to organize attribute information about multiple products in an alternatives X attributes matrix and to have alternatives sorted by any attribute. Based on theoretical and empirical work in marketing, judgment and decision making, psychology, and decision support systems, we develop a set of hypotheses pertaining to the effects of these two decision aids on various aspects of consumer decision making. In particular, we focus on how use of the RA and CM affects consumers' search for product information, the size and quality of their consideration sets, and the quality of their purchase decisions in an online shopping environment. A controlled experiment using a simulated online store was conducted to test the hypotheses. The results indicate that both interactive decision aids have a substantial impact on consumer decision making. As predicted, use of the RA reduces consumers' search effort for product information, decreases the size but increases the quality of their consideration sets, and improves the quality of their purchase decisions. Use of the CM also leads to a decrease in the size but an increase in the quality of consumers' consideration sets, and has a favorable effect on some indicators of decision quality. In sum, our findings suggest that interactive tools designed to assist consumers in the initial screening of available alternatives and to facilitate in-depth comparisons among selected alternatives in an online shopping environment may have strong favorable effects on both the quality and the efficiency of purchase decisions - shoppers can make much better decisions while expending substantially less effort. This suggests that interactive decision aids have the potential to drastically transform the way in which consumers search for product information and make purchase decisions.","Consideration sets; Consumer behavior; Decision aids; Decision making; Electronic commerce; Information processing; Information search; Online shopping; Recommendation agents","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0034340397"

Sharing is a distinct, ancient, and increasingly vital consumer research topic that bears on a broad array of consumption issues ranging from sharing household resources versus atomized family possessions to file sharing versus intellectual property rights. This theoretical review distinguishes between sharing in and sharing out, and suggests that sharing in dissolves interpersonal boundaries posed by materialism and possession attachment through expanding the aggregate extended self. However, such sharing is challenged by growing market commoditization.

Trust plays a central role in helping consumers overcome perceptions of risk and insecurity. Trust makes consumers comfortable sharing personal information, making purchases, and acting on Web vendor advice - behaviors essential to widespread adoption of e-commerce. Therefore, trust is critical to both researchers and practitioners. Prior research on e-commerce trust has used diverse, incomplete, and inconsistent definitions of trust, making it difficult to compare results across studies. This paper contributes by proposing and validating measures for a multidisciplinary, multidimensional model of trust in e-commerce. The model includes four high-level constructs - disposition to trust, institution-based trust, trusting beliefs, and trusting intentions - which are further delineated into 16 measurable, literature-grounded subconstructs. The psychometric properties of the measures are demonstrated through use of a hypothetical, legal advice Web site. The results show that trust is indeed a multidimensional concept. Proposed relationships among the trust constructs are tested (for internal nomological validity), as are relationships between the trust constructs and three other e-commerce constructs (for external nomological validity) - Web experience, personal innovativeness, and Web site quality. Suggestions for future research as well as implications for practice are discussed.","Disposition; Disposition to Trust; e-Commerce; Institution-Based Trust; Measure; Nomological Network; Site Quality; Trust; Trusting Beliefs; Trusting Intentions; Web Vendor","Computer crime; Quality of service; Risk assessment; Websites; Integrative typology; Electronic commerce","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0036737236"

This article fills this void by presenting a conceptual model for relating satisfaction ratings and repurchase behavior. The model is based on the premise that ratings observed in a typical customer satisfaction survey are error-prone measures of the customer's true satisfaction, and they may vary systematically on the basis of consumer characteristics. The authors apply the model to a large-scale study of 100,040 automotive customers. Results show that consumers with different characteristics have different thresholds such that, at the same level of rated satisfaction, repurchase rates are systematically different among different customer groups. The authors also find that the nature and extent of response bias in satisfaction ratings varies by customer characteristics. In one group, the response bias is so high that rated satisfaction is completely uncorrelated to repurchase behavior (r = 0). Furthermore, the authors find that, though nonlinear, the functional form relating rated satisfaction to repurchase intent is different from the one relating it to repurchase behavior. Although the functional form exhibits decreasing returns in the case of repurchase intent, it exhibits monotonically increasing returns in the case of repurchase behavior.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0035530178"

Second, failure to keep track of (monitor) one's own behavior renders control difficult.

The proposed framework (1) uses a multidimensional conceptualization for the trustworthiness construct; (2) incorporates two distinct facets of consumer trust, namely, frontline employees and management pollcies and practices; and (3) specifies value as a key mediator of the trust-loyalty relationship. The authors test the proposed model using data from two service contexts-retail clothing (N = 264) and nonbusiness airline travel (N = 113). The results support a tripartite view of trustworthiness evaluations along operational competence, operational benevolence, and problem-solving orientation dimensions. Moreover, the authors find evidence of contingent asymmetric relationships between trustworthiness dimensions and consumer trust. For frontline employees, benevolent behaviors demonstrate a dominant ""negativity"" effect (i.e., a unit negative performance has a stronger effect than a unit positive performance), whereas problem-solving orientation has a dominant ""positivity"" effect (i.e., a unit positive performance has a stronger effect than a unit negative performance). Value completely mediates the effect of frontline employee trust on loyalty in the retailing context and partially mediates the effect of management pollcies and practices trust on loyalty in the airlines context. The role of frontline employees is more critical in the retailing context, whereas management practices and policies play the dominant role in the airlines context. Overall, the proposed framework successfully models trust and loyalty mechanisms across the two industries examined in the Study, while remaining sensitive to essential contextual differences.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0036001754"

This phenomenon impacts online retailers as this easily accessible information could greatly affect the online consumption decision. The purpose of this paper is to examine the extent to which opinion seekers are willing to accept and adopt online consumer reviews and which factors encourage adoption. Design/methodology/approach - Using dual-process theories, an information adoption model was developed to examine the factors affecting information adoption of online opinion seekers in online customer communities. The model was tested empirically using a sample of 154 users who had experience within the online customer community, Openrice.com. Users were required to complete a survey regarding the online consumer reviews received from the virtual sharing platform. Findings - The paper found comprehensiveness and relevance to be the most effective components of the argument quality construct of the research model, making them key influencers of information adoption. Research limitations/implications - Only 46 per cent of the variance is explained by the constructs due to its intentional simplicity. This would indicate that there are more actors in motivating information adoption than solely information usefulness. A closer look should be taken at the effectiveness of some of the other motivational factors suggested in the previous research on this topic. Practical implications - The paper outlines ways to effectively promote one's business or cause through online customer communities, as well as general tips for web site and forum moderators for facilitating such presentation in a manner useful to the members of their online communities. Originality/value - This paper is one of the first to develop and empirically test a theory-driven information adoption model for opinion seekers in online customer communities. It also uniquely breaks down and tests the components of argument quality to discern the important motivating factors. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Consumer behaviour; Electronic commerce; Internet","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-45749127825"

Yet the lack of an interpersonal exchange and the one-time nature of the typical business transaction on the Internet make this kind of consumer trust unique, because trust relates to other people and is nourished through interactions with them. This study validates a four-dimensional scale of trust in the context of e-Products and revalidates it in the context of e-Services. The study then shows the influence of social presence on these dimensions of this trust, especially benevolence, and its ultimate contribution to online purchase intentions. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

In these situations economic theory will make systematic errors in predicting behavior. Kanneman and Tversey's prospect theory is proposed as the basis for an alternative descriptive theory.

Arguing that research on brand love needs to be built on an understanding of how consumers actually experience this phenomenon, they conduct two qualitative studies to uncover the different elements (""features"") of the consumer prototype of brand love. Then, they use structural equations modeling on survey data to explore how these elements can be modeled as both first-order and higher-order structural models. A higher-order model yields seven core elements: self-brand integration, passion-driven behaviors, positive emotional connection, long-term relationship, positive overall attitude valence, attitude certainty and confidence (strength), and anticipated separation distress. In addition to these seven core elements of brand love itself, the prototype includes quality beliefs as an antecedent of brand love and brand loyalty, word of mouth, and resistance to negative information as outcomes. Both the first-order and higher-order brand love models predict loyalty, word of mouth, and resistance better, and provide a greater understanding, than an overall summary measure of brand love.

We conduct a meta-analysis of the relationship of financial literacy and of financial education to financial behaviors in 168 papers covering 201 prior studies. We find that interventions to improve financial literacy explain only 0.1% of the variance in financial behaviors studied, with weaker effects in low-income samples. Like other education, financial education decays over time; even large interventions with many hours of instruction have negligible effects on behavior 20 months or more from the time of intervention. Correlational studies that measure financial literacy find stronger associations with financial behaviors. We conduct three empirical studies, and we find that the partial effects of financial literacy diminish dramatically when one controls for psychological traits that have been omitted in prior research or when one uses an instrument for financial literacy to control for omitted variables. Financial education as studied to date has serious limitations that have been masked by the apparently larger effects in correlational studies. We envisage a reduced role for financial education that is not elaborated or acted upon soon afterward. We suggest a real but narrower role for ""just-in-time"" financial education tied to specific behaviors it intends to help. We conclude with a discussion of the characteristics of behaviors that might affect the policy maker's mix of financial education, choice architecture, and regulation as tools to help consumer financial behavior. © 2014 INFORMS.","Behavioral economics; Causal effects; Consumer behavior; Design of experiments; Education systems; Financial education; Financial literacy; Government programs; Household finance; Meta-analysis; Public policy; Statistics","Consumer behavior; Decision making; Design of experiments; Education; Public policy; Statistics; Behavioral economics; Causal effects; Education systems; Financial education; Financial literacy; Government projects; Meta-analysis; Finance","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84898685758"

Building consumer trust is a strategic imperative for web-based vendors because trust strongly influences consumer intentions to transact with unfamiliar vendors via the web. Trust allows consumers to overcome perceptions of risk and uncertainty, and to engage in the following three behaviors that are critical to the realization of a web-based vendor's strategic objectives: following advice offered by the web vendor, sharing personal information with the vendor, and purchasing from the vendor's web site. Trust in the vendor is defined as a multi-dimensional construct with two inter-related components - trusting beliefs (perceptions of the competence, benevolence, and integrity of the vendor), and trusting intentions - willingness to depend (that is, a decision to make oneself vulnerable to the vendor). Three factors are proposed for building consumer trust in the vendor: structural assurance (that is, consumer perceptions of the safety of the web environment), perceived web vendor reputation, and perceived web site quality. The model is tested in the context of a hypothetical web site offering legal advice. All three factors significantly influenced consumer trust in the web vendor. That is, these factors, especially web site quality and reputation, are powerful levers that vendors can use to build consumer trust, in order to overcome the negative perceptions people often have about the safety of the web environment. The study also demonstrates that perceived Internet risk negatively affects consumer intentions to transact with a web-based vendor. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.","Building consumer trust; Trust building model; Uncertainty","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-57049155255"

But they' re measuring the wrong thing. The best predictor of top-line growth can usually be captured in a single survey question: Would you recommend this company to a friend? This finding is based on two years of research in which a variety of survey questions were tested by linking the responses with actual customer behavior-purchasing patterns and referrals - and ultimately with company growth. Surprisingly, the most effective question wasn't about customer satisfaction or even loyalty per se. In most of the industries studied, the percentage of customers enthusiastic enough about a company to refer it to a friend or colleague directly correlated with growth rates among competitors. Willingness to talk up a company or product to friends, family, and colleagues is one of the best indicators of loyalty because of the customer's sacrifice in making the recommendation. When customers act as references, they do more than indicate they've received good economic value from a company; they put their own reputations on the line. And they will risk their reputations only if they feel intense loyalty. The findings point to a new, simpler approach to customer research, one directly linked to a company's results. By substituting a single question - blunt tool though it may appear to be - for the complex black box of the customer satisfaction survey, companies can actually put consumer survey results to use and focus employees on the task of stimulating growth.","","Commerce; Consumer Satisfaction; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Marketing; Personnel Loyalty; Questionnaires; United States; article; commercial phenomena; consumer; human; human relation; marketing; methodology; personnel management; questionnaire; standard; United States","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-1342312200"

Drawing upon literatures in several disciplines, we present a theory of resilience that encompasses contemporary understandings of stress, adaptation, wellness, and resource dynamics. Community resilience is a process linking a network of adaptive capacities (resources with dynamic attributes) to adaptation after a disturbance or adversity. Community adaptation is manifest in population wellness, defined as high and non-disparate levels of mental and behavioral health, functioning, and quality of life. Community resilience emerges from four primary sets of adaptive capacities-Economic Development, Social Capital, Information and Communication, and Community Competence-that together provide a strategy for disaster readiness. To build collective resilience, communities must reduce risk and resource inequities, engage local people in mitigation, create organizational linkages, boost and protect social supports, and plan for not having a plan, which requires flexibility, decision-making skills, and trusted sources of information that function in the face of unknowns. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Community resilience; Disaster; Preparedness; Resilience","Adaptation, Psychological; Consumer Participation; Disaster Planning; Humans; Models, Theoretical; Residence Characteristics; Social Support; adaptive behavior; article; consumer; demography; disaster planning; human; social support; theoretical model","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-40149095411"

From the responses of 582 adult consumers to a nationwide survey (n = 1,302), a profile of the ecologically conscious consumer was developed. The findings suggest that ecologically conscious consumers of the 1990s differ from their predecessors. Demographics explained only 6% of the variation in the sample's ECCB.

Because the pursuit of differentness (or counterconformity motivation) varies across individuals to influence consumer responses, we develop and validate a trait measure of consumers' need for uniqueness. Consumers' need for uniqueness is defined as an individual's pursuit of differentness relative to others that is achieved through the acquisition, utilization, and disposition of consumer goods for the purpose of developing and enhancing one's personal and social identity. Following assessments of the scale's latent structure, a series of validation studies examines the scale's validity.

Despite these advancements, the engagement concept remains underexplored to date. This paper addresses this gap by reviewing literature in other disciplines and marketing, and developing a tripartite customer brand-engagement conceptualisation comprising activation, identification, and absorption dimensions. Further, a conceptual model illustrating the conceptually distinct nature of and relationships between customer brand engagement and other marketing constructs is proposed, followed by a customer engagement/loyaltybased segmentation analysis. Enhanced insights into customer engagement are expected to be valuable for marketing scholars and practitioners seeking to enhance customer relationships, retention, and loyalty.

Tourism image will also exercise some influence on the quality perceived by tourists and on the satisfaction obtained from the holiday experience. This paper focuses on the relationship between the image of a destination as perceived by tourists and their behavioural intentions, and between that same image and the post-purchase evaluation of the stay. We will also examine the relationship between quality and satisfaction and between these variables and the tourist's behaviour variables. We place the accent on a joint analysis of these relationships, using a structural equation model. The results of the empirical study show that tourism image is a direct antecedent of perceived quality, satisfaction, intention to return and willingness to recommend the destination. The role of image as a key factor in destination marketing is thus confirmed. With reference to the other relationships, on the one hand, it is confirmed that quality has a positive influence on satisfaction and intention to return and that satisfaction determines the willingness to recommend the destination. However, the influence of quality on 'willingness to recommend' and the influence of satisfaction on 'intention to return' cannot be corroborated. In this sense, further research could be necessary. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Online executives note that creating a compelling online experience for cyber customers is critical to creating competitive advantage on the Internet. Yet, very little is known about the factors that make using the Web a compelling experience for its users, and of the key consumer behavior outcomes of this compelling experience. Recently, the flow construct has been proposed as important for understanding consumer behavior on the World Wide Web, and as a way of defining the nature of compelling online experience. Although widely studied over the past 20 years, quantitative modeling efforts of the flow construct have been neither systematic nor comprehensive. In large parts, these efforts have been hampered by considerable confusion regarding the exact conceptual definition of flow. Lacking precise definition, it has been difficult to measure flow empirically, let alone apply the concept in practice. Following the conceptual model of flow proposed by Hoffman and Novak (1996), we conceptualize flow on the Web as a cognitive state experienced during navigation that is determined by (1) high levels of skill and control; (2) high levels of challenge and arousal; and (3) focused attention; and (4) is enhanced by interactivity and telepresence. Consumers who achieve flow on the Web are so acutely involved in the act of online navigation that thoughts and perceptions not relevant to navigation are screened out, and the consumer focuses entirely on the interaction. Concentration on the navigation experience is so intense that there is little attention left to consider anything else, and consequently, other events occurring in the consumer's surrounding physical environment lose significance. Self-consciousness disappears, the consumer's sense of time becomes distorted, and the state of mind arising as a result of achieving flow on the Web is extremely gratifying. In a quantitative modeling framework, we develop a structural model based on our previous conceptual model of flow that embodies the components of what makes for a compelling online experience. We use data collected from a large-sample, Web-based consumer survey to measure these constructs, and we fit a series of structural equation models that test related prior theory. The conceptual model is largely supported, and the improved fit offered by the revised model provides additional insights into the direct and indirect influences of flow, as well as into the relationship of flow to key consumer behavior and Web usage variables. Our formulation provides marketing scientists with operational definitions of key model constructs and establishes reliability and validity in a comprehensive measurement framework. A key insight from the paper is that the degree to which the online experience is compelling can be defined, measured, and related well to important marketing variables. Our model constructs relate in significant ways to key consumer behavior variables, including online shopping and Web use applications such as the extent to which consumers search for product information and participate in chat rooms. As such, our model may be useful both theoretically and in practice as marketers strive to decipher the secrets of commercial success in interactive online environments.","Electronic commerce; Internet marketing; Online consumer behavior","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0034340409"

In today's electronic world, the competitive strategies of successful firms increasingly depend on vast amounts of customer data. Ironically, the same information practices that provide value to organizations also raise privacy concerns for individuals. This study hypothesized that organizations can address these privacy concerns and gain business advantage through customer retention by observing procedural fairness: customers will be willing to disclose personal information and have that information subsequently used to create consumer profiles for business use when there are fair procedures in place to protect individual privacy. Because customer relationships are characterized by social distance, customers must depend on strangers to act on their behalf. Procedural fairness serves as an intermediary to build trust when interchangeable organizational agents exercise considerable delegated power on behalf of customers who cannot specify or constrain their behavior. Our hypothesis was supported as we found that when customers are explicitly told that fair information practices are employed, privacy concerns do not distinguish consumers who are willing to be profiled from those who are unwilling to have their personal information used in this way.","Information Privacy; Organizational Information Processing; Procedural Justice; Service Quality; Trust","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0033464665"

At the same time, there is little empirical evidence underlying all this speculation. This article provides one such data set. It reports on factors that consumers found salient as they browsed through selected electronic malls on the World Wide Web. We gathered consumers' reactions via an open-ended survey using a sample of 220 shoppers. We related the reactions to the factors of product perceptions, shopping experience, customer service, and perceived consumer risk, which we had identified from the existing literature on retail patronage behavior. This study translated these factors to the World Wide Web context and explored their relative salience. With respect to product perceptions, consumers were impressed by the breadth of stores on the World Wide Web but disappointed with the depth of a merchant's offerings. The shopping experience was reported to be generally enjoyable, but at the same time frustrating. Consumers also reported that they could perceive the potential for time savings and reduced effort compared with traditional forms of shopping, but that, at present, goal-directed shopping was difficult. Nearly everyone in the sample had something negative to say about customer service on the World Wide Web, judging that the sites were not designed to be responsive to their needs and that the presentation of goods and services seemed intangible. Risk was cited as a barrier to shopping on the World Wide Web, but was not as salient to our sample as product perceptions, shopping experience, and customer service. Overall, the results suggest that World Wide Web merchants need to think more about how they perform on the factors known to affect consumer behavior; namely, product perceptions, shopping experience, and customer service. We offer advice for enhancing the design of World Wide Web retail sites. Copyright © 1997 M.E.

Yet CSR's halo on consumer behavior may extend beyond product evaluations, into nonroutine types of judgments such as attributions. We examine the possibility that the CSR halo affects consumers' attributions in a product-harm crisis situation. In two studies that employ experimental manipulations of prior CSR on a sample of consumers, we examine whether attributions that are influenced by CSR mediate the impact of product-harm crises on consumers' brand evaluations. The results of Study 1 support the hypothesis. Study 2 introduces a boundary condition on the results of Study 1, showing that mediation effects are only found for consumers that are CSR-sensitive.

Results confirm the double identity of the online consumer as a shopper and a computer user because both shopping enjoyment and perceived usefulness of the site strongly predict intention to return. Our results on unplanned purchases are not conclusive. We also test some individual and Web site factors that can affect the consumer's emotional and cognitive responses. Product involvement, Web skills, challenges, and use of value-added search mechanisms all have a significant impact on the Web consumer. The study provides a more rounded, albeit partial, view of the online consumer and is a significant step towards a better understanding of consumer behavior on the Web. The validated metrics should be of use to researchers and practitioners alike.","Flow Theory; Nomological Validity; Online Consumer Behavior; TAM; Value-Added Search Mechanisms; Web Skills","Cognitive systems; Electronic commerce; Information technology; Societies and institutions; Online consumer behavior; Websites","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0036015968"

In the process of the review, the authors develop a comprehensive framework for conceptualizing and encouraging sustainable consumer behavior change. The framework is represented by the acronym SHIFT, and it proposes that consumers are more inclined to engage in pro-environmental behaviors when the message or context leverages the following psychological factors: Social influence, Habit formation, Individual self, Feelings and cognition, and Tangibility. The authors also identify five broad challenges to encouraging sustainable behaviors and use these to develop novel theoretical propositions and directions for future research.

The concept of customer engagement (CE) aggregates the multiple ways customer behaviors beyond transactions may influence the firm. However, the term is embryonic and academics and practitioners alike lack understanding on how CE contributes to value co-creation. This article marks the first attempt to conceptualize the role of customer engagement behavior (CEB) in value co-creation within a multistakeholder service system. We combine the theoretical perspectives of CE and value co-creation research to the analysis of a rich case study of a public transport service system involving consumers, communities, businesses, and governmental organizations. Our findings describe drivers for CEB, identify four types of CEB, and explore the value outcomes experienced by various stakeholders. This article proposes that CEB affects value co-creation by virtue of customers' diverse resource contributions toward the focal firm and/other stakeholders that modify and/or augment the offering, and/or affect other stakeholders' perceptions, preferences, expectations, or actions toward the firm or its offering. Through inducing broader resource integration, CEB makes value co-creation a system-level process. We offer nine research propositions explicating the connections CEB has to value co-creation by focal customers, the focal firm, and other stakeholders. Our research suggests that firms should focus greater attention on the resources that customers can contribute, explore the potential to engage diverse stakeholders around a common cause, and employ organically emerging systems that provide opportunities for more extensive value co-creation. © The Author(s) 2014.","customer communities; customer engagement; resource integration; service system; value co-creation","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84903397760"

Consumers seem to be more influenced by early negative information, especially when the overall set of reviews is negative. However, positively framed information together with numerical rating details increases both booking intentions and consumer trust.

User satisfaction, in turn, is influenced by their confirmation of expectation from prior IS use and perceived usefulness.

Using a field survey design, Study 1 provides evidence that perceived corporate social responsibility affects not only customer purchase behavior through customer-corporate identification but also customer donations to corporate-supported nonprofit organizations. Using experimental designs, Studies 2 and 3 replicate and extend the Study 1 findings by providing additional evidence for the mediating role of customer-corporate identification on the relationship between corporate social responsibility and customer donations. However, the combined results of Studies 2 and 3 also show that because of a ""perceived opportunity to do good"" by supporting a company that is changing its ways, consumers are more likely to donate to a corporate-supported nonprofit when the corporation has a weaker historical record of socially responsible behavior.

The reality of consumer hedonics is different. When people make purchases, they often experience an immediate pain of paying, which can undermine the pleasure derived from consumption. The ticking of the taxi meter, for example, reduces one's pleasure from the ride. We propose a ""double-entry"" mental accounting theory that describes the nature of these reciprocal interactions between the pleasure of consumption and the pain of paying and draws out their implications for consumer behavior and hedonics. A central assumption of the model, which we call prospective accounting, is that consumption that has already been paid for can be enjoyed as if it were free and that the pain associated with payments made prior to consumption (but not after) is buffered by thoughts of the benefits that the payments will finance. Another important concept is coupling, which refers to the degree to which consumption calls to mind thoughts of payment, and vice versa. Some financing methods, such as credit cards, tend to weaken coupling, whereas others, such as cash payment, produce tight coupling. Our model makes a variety of predictions that are at variance with economic formulations. Contrary to the standard prediction that people will finance purchases to minimize the present value of payments, our model predicts strong debt aversion - that they should prefer to prepay for consumption or to get paid for work after it is performed. Such pay-before sequences confer hedonic benefits because consumption can be enjoyed without thinking about the need to pay for it in the future. Likewise, when paying beforehand, the pain of paying is mitigated by thoughts of future consumption benefits. Contrary to the economic prediction that consumers should prefer to pay, at the margin, for what they consume, our model predicts that consumers will find it less painful to pay for, and hence will prefer, flat-rate pricing schemes such as unlimited Internet access at a fixed monthly price, even if it involves paying more for the same usage. Other predictions concern spending patterns with cash, charge, or credit cards, and preferences for the earmarking of purchases. We test these predictions in a series of surveys and in a conjoint-like analysis that pitted our double-entry mental accounting model against a standard discounting formulation and another benchmark that did not incorporate hedonic interactions between consumption and payments. Our model provides a better fit of the data for 60% of the subjects; the discounting formulation provides a better fit for only 29% of the subjects (even when allowing for positive and negative discount rates). The pain of paying, we argue, plays an important role in consumer self-regulation, but is hedonically costly. From a hedonic perspective the ideal situation is one in which payments are tightly coupled to consumption (so that paying evokes thoughts about the benefits being financed) but consumption is decoupled from payments (so that consumption does not evoke thoughts about payment). From an efficiency perspective, however, it is important for consumers to be aware of what they are paying for consumption. This creates a tension between hedonic efficiency and what we call decision efficiency. Various institutional arrangements, such as financing of public parks through taxes or usage fees, play into this tradeoff. A producer developing a pricing structure for their product or service should be aware of these two conflicting objectives, and should try to devise a structure that reconciles them.","Consumer choice; Framing; Mental accounting","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0032220719"

The study, based on a survey of 416 hotel users, also investigates how a green hotel image can affect behavioural intentions (i.e. intention to revisit, intention to offer positive recommendations to others and willingness to pay a premium). The findings confirm that cognitive image components (namely value and quality attributes) can exert a positive influence on a green hotel's affective and overall images. The affective image is also found to positively affect a green hotel's overall image. A green hotel's overall image, in turn, can contribute to more favourable behavioural intentions. Quality attributes were found to be more powerful than value attributes. The importance of the concept of selfish altruism and obtaining a feeling of wellbeing from a purchase were shown to be very strong.

The results are consistent with previous research on moral behaviour.","Consumer behaviour; Consumer marketing; Environment; Greece; Green markering; United Kingdom","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0012946474"

Despite recent claims that such behavior has become more widespread in recent years, political consumerism has not been studied systematically in survey research on political participation. Through the use of a pilot survey conducted among 1015 Canadian, Belgian, and Swedish students, we ascertain whether political consumerism is a sufficiently consistent behavioral pattern to be measured and studied meaningfully. The data from this pilot survey allow us to build a ""political consumerism index"" incorporating attitudinal, behavioral, and frequency measurements. Our analysis of this cross-national student sample suggests that political consumerism is primarily a tool of those who are distrustful of political institutions. However, political consumers have more trust in other citizens, and they are disproportionately involved in checkbook organizations. They also tend to score highly on measures of political efficacy and post-materialism. We strongly suggest including measurements of political consumerism together with other emerging forms of activism in future population surveys on political participation. © 2005 International Political Science Association.","Civic engagement; Consumer behavior; Political consumerism; Political participation; Survey measurements","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-23444459028"

In this study, we develop a model that examines how idiosyncratic preferences of early buyers can affect long-term consumer purchase behavior as well as the social welfare created by review systems. Our model provides an explanation for the structure of product ratings over time, which we empirically test using online book reviews posted on Amazon.com.

The study has used the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) and further extended the TPB including additional constructs namely; perceived value and willingness to pay premium (WPP) and measured its appropriateness in determining consumer green purchase intention and behavior. A total of 620 usable responses were collected with the help of a questionnaire survey using the convenience sampling approach. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was used to evaluate the strength of relationships among constructs. The findings reported that TPB fully supported the consumers' intention to buy green products which in turn influences their green purchase behavior. Inclusion of additional constructs was supported in the TPB as it has improved the predicted power of the TPB framework in predicting consumer green purchase intention and behavior.

They first deduce a taxonomy of models, discuss the theoretical principles of each class of models, and summarize their empirical findings. They then synthesize five generalizations about how advertising works and propose directions for further research. Advertising effects are classified into intermediate effects, for example, on consumer beliefs and attitudes, and behavioral effects, which relate to purchasing behavior, for example, on brand choice. The generalizations suggest that there is little support for any hierarchy, in the sense of temporal sequence, of effects. The authors propose that advertising effects should be studied in a space, with affect, cognition, and experience as the three dimensions. Advertising's positioning in this space should be determined by context, which reflects advertising's goal diversity, product category, competition, other aspects of mix, stage of product life cycle, and target market.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0033476852"

The purpose of this paper is to study the effect of customer engagement behaviors on perceived relationship benefits and relationship outcomes. Design/methodology/approach: An online survey of members of a gaming Facebook brand community, resulting in 276 usable responses from gaming customers. Findings: Customer engagement was divided into ""Community Engagement Behaviors"" (CEB) and ""Transactional Engagement Behaviors"" (TEB). In addition, three relationship benefits were identified: social benefits, entertainment benefits and economic benefits. The engagement behaviors largely influenced the benefits received. Furthermore, the mediation analysis results show that the influence of CEB on satisfaction is partially mediated by social benefits and entertainment benefits, while the effect of TEB on satisfaction is fully mediated through the same benefits. The effect of CEB on loyalty is mediated through entertainment benefits. Research limitations/implications: The findings are limited to one brand community. The findings have implications for further research on customer engagement. Practical implications: The paper's findings give ideas about how firms can utilize Facebook communities to enhance satisfaction and loyalty by offering the right kinds of relationship benefits. Managers are encouraged to study customer engagement behaviors on, and perceptions of, all channels and to utilize this information for the development of their social media strategies. Originality/value: Customer engagement is a newly introduced concept on which scarce empirical research exists, and there is very little evidence of its effect on customer relationships. This is the first paper to study customer engagement empirically on a Facebook brand community, and to relate customer engagement to relationship constructs. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Brand community; Brands; Communities; Consumer behaviour; Customer engagement; Customer loyalty; Customer satisfaction; Facebook; Relationship benefits; Social media; Social networking sites","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84864125530"

This study examines how the online market for e-cigarettes has changed over time: in product design and in marketing messages appearing on websites. Methods Comprehensive internet searches of Englishlanguage websites from May–August 2012 and December 2013–January 2014 identified brands, models, flavours, nicotine strengths, ingredients and product claims. Brands were divided into older and newer groups (by the two searches) for comparison. Results By January 2014 there were 466 brands (each with its own website) and 7764 unique flavours. In the 17 months between the searches, there was a net increase of 10.5 brands and 242 new flavours per month. Older brands were more likely than newer brands to offer cigalikes (86.9% vs 52.1%, p<0.01), and newer brands more likely to offer the more versatile eGos and mods (75.3% vs 57.8%, p<0.01). Older brands were significantly more likely to claim that they were healthier and cheaper than cigarettes, were good substitutes where smoking was banned and were effective smoking cessation aids. Newer brands offered more flavours per brand (49 vs 32, p<0.01) and were less likely to compare themselves with conventional cigarettes. Conclusions The number of e-cigarette brands is large and has been increasing. Older brands tend to highlight their advantages over conventional cigarettes while newer brands emphasise consumer choice in multiple flavours and product versatility. These results can serve as a benchmark for future research on the impact of upcoming regulations on product design and advertising messages of e-cigarettes. © 2014, BMJ Publishing Group.

The authors identify psychographic and demographic traits that potentially drive usage of store brands and national brand promotions. They then develop a framework and structural equation model to study the association of these traits with store brand and national brand promotion usage. The authors find that though demographics do not influence these behaviors directly, they have significant associations with psychographic characteristics and therefore are useful for market targeting. Most important, usage of store brands and usage of promotions, particularly out-of-store promotions, are associated with different psychographics. Store brand use correlates mainly with traits related to economic benefits and costs, whereas the use of out-of-store promotions is associated mainly with traits related to hedonic benefits and costs. These differences result in four well-defined and identifiable consumer segments: deal-focused consumers, store brand-focused consumers, deal and store brand users (use-all), and nonusers of both store brands and deals (use-none). Therefore, manufacturers and retailers have the opportunity to either avoid each other or compete head to head, depending on which segment they target.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0035624897"

As a cause of negative economic, environmental and social effects, food waste is considered to be one of the sustainability issues that needs to be addressed. In developed countries, consumers are one of the biggest sources of food waste. To successfully reduce consumer-related food waste, it is necessary to have a clear understanding of the factors influencing food waste-related consumer perceptions and behaviors. The present paper presents the results of a literature review and expert interviews on factors causing consumer-related food waste in households and supply chains. Results show that consumers' motivation to avoid food waste, their management skills of food provisioning and food handling and their trade-offs between priorities have an extensive influence on their food waste behaviors.

This study attempts to uncover personal and contextual barriers to consumers' purchases of green food and to strengthen knowledge about fostering green purchases. Survey data are used to examine the influence of distinct categories of personal factors (such as attitudes, personal norms, perceived behavior barriers, knowledge) and contextual factors (such as socioeconomic characteristics, living conditions, and store characteristics) on green purchases of Swiss consumers. Results from regression analysis suggest that green food purchases are facilitated by positive attitudes of consumers toward (a) environmental protection, (b) fair trade, (c) local products, and (d) availability of action-related knowledge. In turn, green behavior is negatively associated with (e) perceived time barriers and (f) frequency of shopping in supermarkets. Surprisingly, green purchases are not significantly related to moral thinking, monetary barriers, or the socioeconomic characteristics of the consumers.

A virtual store allows companies to provide product information and offer direct sales to their customers through an electronic channel. The fundamental problem motivating this study is that: in order for a virtual store to compete effectively with both physical stores and other online retailers, there is an urgent need to understand the factors that entice consumers to use it. This research attempted to provide both theoretical and empirical analyses to explain consumers' use of a virtual store and its antecedents. By applying the technology acceptance model (TAM) and innovation diffusion theory (IDT), this research took an extended perspective to examine consumer behavior in the virtual store context. The data from a survey of online consumers was used empirically to test the proposed research model. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was performed to examine the reliability and validity of the measurement model, and the structural equation modeling (SEM) technique was used to evaluate the causal model.

Current sustainability strategies have three major deficiencies: they do not directly focus on the customer, they do not recognize the looming threats from rising global over-consumption, and they do not take a holistic approach. We present a framework for a customer-centric approach to sustainability. This approach recasts the sustainability metric to emphasize the outcomes of business actions measured holistically in term of environmental, personal and economic well-being of the consumer. We introduce the concept of mindful consumption (MC) as the guiding principle in this approach. MC is premised on a consumer mindset of caring for self, for community, and for nature, that translates behaviorally into tempering the self-defeating excesses associated with acquisitive, repetitive and aspirational consumption. We also make the business case for fostering mindful consumption, and illustrate how the marketing function can be harnessed to successfully implement the customer-centric approach to sustainability. © 2010 Academy of Marketing Science.","Customer-centric sustainability; Mindful consumption; Sustainability","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-78650978170"

""Downstream-plus"" interventions provide informational input at points when habits are vulnerable to change, such as when people are undergoing naturally occurring changes in performance environments for many everyday actions (e.g., moving households, changing jobs).

The focus of the analysis is on exploring the influence of determinants as hypothesised by the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) - attitudes, perceived behavioural control, social norms - on sustainable consumption intention in general, and specifically depending on consumer's perceived confidence and personal values. The empirical research builds on a survey with a sample of 456 young adults using a questionnaire and showing an advertisement for hypothetical sustainable dairy products. Stepwise multiple regression models showed that 50% of the variance in intention to consume sustainable dairy was explained by the combination of personal attitudes, perceived social influences, perceived consumer effectiveness and perceived availability. In addition, different levels of confidence and value orientation yield different strengths of the determinants.

To further our theoretical understanding, we extend the notion of Gestalt to consumers' perceptions of retail environments and demonstrated that consumers perceive Services-capes holistically. Specifically, we suggest that the arousing quality of ambient stimuli is one dimension along which holistic evaluations occur, and that pleasant ambient stimuli are perceived more positively when their arousing qualities match rather than mismatch. We manipulated scent and music in a 3 (no music, pleasant low arousal and high arousal music) by 3 (no scent, pleasant low and high arousal scents) factorial design in a field setting. Our findings show that when ambient scent and music are congruent with each other in terms of their arousing qualities, consumers rate the environment significantly more positive, exhibit higher levels of approach and impulse buying behaviors, and experience enhanced satisfaction than when these environmental cues were at odds with each other. © 2001 by New York University.

This study aims to explore and demonstrate the utility of big data analytics to better understand important hospitality issues, namely the relationship between hotel guest experience and satisfaction. Specifically, this study applies a text analytical approach to a large quantity of consumer reviews extracted from Expedia.com to deconstruct hotel guest experience and examine its association with satisfaction ratings. The findings reveal several dimensions of guest experience that carried varying weights and, more importantly, have novel, meaningful semantic compositions. The association between guest experience and satisfaction appears strong, suggesting that these two domains of consumer behavior are inherently connected.

In addition, while the unique characteristics of the Internet contributed to our belief that flow was an important construct for understanding consumer use of the Web in 1996, the environment of the Web itself has changed radically over the past decade. Thus, we consider the current context of the Internet, including virtual worlds, for the role and application of the flow construct, as well as important related constructs that will be useful for understanding compelling experiences in the contemporary online environment. © 2008 Direct Marketing Educational Foundation, Inc.","Internet marketing; Online consumer behavior; User experience","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-68349134239"

Design/methodology/approach - A quantitative and qualitative research methodology using a questionnaire along with secondary research has been proposed. A structured questionnaire has been used using convenience-sampling techniques from National Capital Region in India. Correlation and factor analysis has been used to explore consumers' attitudes and behaviour towards green practices in the lodging industry. Findings - The consumers using hotel services are conscious about environmentally friendly practices in India. They patronise the hotels that have adapted green practices though not compromising on service quality. The consumers would prefer to use lodging that follows these practices but are not willing to pay extra for these services. Indian hotels have the competitive advantage over similar products if they follow green practices. Practical implications - The hotels would have to invest in environmentally friendly practices and look at long-term gains. The government needs to acknowledge and institutionalise the practice by instituting rewards and offering benefits in taxes. Originality/value - The paper attempts to bring out facts regarding customer buying behaviour towards green practices in the Indian hotel industry. The resource scenario in India is grim with regard to the water and sanitation. The tourism industry has a big responsibility in ensuring that business models adopted are sustainable in the long run and hence the need to imbibe green practices as a preferred business model. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Consumer behaviour; Corporate social responsibility; Green marketing; Hotel and catering industry; India","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-34547344303"

We propose that persuasior knowledge is used when consumers draw an inference that a persuasion motive may underlie a salesperson's behavior. These motive inferences then affect perceptions of the salesperson. We propose that two factors, the accessibility of persuasion motives and the cognitive capacity of the consumer, affect whether consumers use persuasion knowledge. When an ulterior persuasion motive is highly accessible, both cognitively busy targets and unbusy observers use persuasion knowledge to evaluate the salesperson. When an ulterior motive is less accessible cognitively busy targets are less likely to use persuasion knowledge, evaluating the salesperson as more sincere than are cognitively unbusy observers. Several experiments find support for the predictions.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0034343675"

A number of currently prominent approaches to urbanization respond to this question by privileging the role of individual locational choice in response to amenity values as the motor of contemporary urban growth. Amenities, it is often said, have an especially potent effect on the migration patterns of individuals endowed with high levels of human capital. However, these approaches raise many unanswered questions. Theories that describe urban growth as a response to movements of people in search of consumer or lifestyle preferences can be questioned on the grounds of their assumptions about human behavior, as well as their silence in regard to the geographical dynamics of production and work. We argue that a more effective line of explanation must relate urban growth directly to the economic geography of production and must explicitly deal with the complex recursive interactions between the location of firms and the movements of labor. In this context, we also offer a reinterpretation of the currently fashionable notions of 'creativity' and the role of skilled labor in cities. © The Author (2009).

The resultant frustration, together with community calls for genuine partnership in the research process, has highlighted the importance of an alternative paradigm. Community-based participatory research (CBPR) is presented as a promising collaborative approach that combines systematic inquiry, participation, and action to address urban health problems. Following a brief review of its basic tenets and historical roots, key ways in which CBPR adds value to urban health research are introduced and illustrated. Case study examples from diverse international settings are used to illustrate some of the difficult ethical challenges that may arise in the course of CBPR partnership approaches. The concepts of partnership synergy and cultural humility, together with protocols such as Green et al.'s guidelines for appraising CBPR projects, are highlighted as useful tools for urban health researchers seeking to apply this collaborative approach and to deal effectively with the difficult ethical challenges it can present. © The Author 2005.

In this context, the shifting emphasis to relational marketing has devoted a lot of effort to analyse how other constructs such as trust predict future intention. The fact that there are conceptual connections of trust to the notion of satisfaction and loyalty, and thatthis effort is especially lacking in the brand‐consumer relationship, moves the authors to focus on analysing the relationships existing among these concepts.

Yet most revenue management methodologies ignore this phenomenon -or at best approximate it in a heuristic way. In this paper, we provide an exact and quite general analysis of this problem. Specifically, we analyze a single-leg reserve management problem in which the buyers' choice behavior is modeled explicitly. The choice model is very general, simply specifying the probability of purchase for each fare product as a function of the set of fare products offered. The control problem is to decide which subset of fare products to offer at each point in time. We show that the optimal policy for this problem has a quite simple form. Namely, it consists of identifying an ordered family of ""efficient"" subsets S1,. . ., S1, and at each point in time opening one of these sets Sk, where the optimal index k is increasing in the remaining capacity x and decreasing in the remaining time. That is, the more capacity (or less time) available, the further the optimal set is along this sequence. We also show that the optimal policy is a nested allocation policy if and only if the sequence of efficient sets is nested, that is S1 ⊆ S2 ⊆ . . . ⊆ Sm. Moreover, we give a characterization of when nesting by fare order is optimal. We also develop an estimation procedure for this setting based on the expectation-maximization (EM) method that jointly estimates arrival rates and choice model parameters when no-purchase outcomes are unobservable. Numerical results are given to illustrate both the model arid estimation procedure.","Discrete choice theory; Dynamic programming; EM method; Maximum likelihood estimation; Revenue management; Yield management","Dynamic programming; Functions; Heuristic methods; Management; Mathematical models; Probability; Set theory; Theorem proving; Discrete choice theory; Expectation-maximization (EM) method; Maximum liklihood estimation; Revenue management; Yield management; Customer satisfaction","Review","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-1242309352"

For example, in the United Kingdom, there are no panel data on consumers' expenditure or on household labor supply, but there are several large household surveys carried out every year. Samples for these surveys are drawn anew each year, so that it is impossible to track individual households over time. This paper considers the possibility of tracking 'cohorts' through such data. A 'cohort' is defined as a group with fixed membership, individuals of which can be identified as they show up in the surveys. The most obvious example is an age cohort, e.g. all males born between 1945 and 1950, but there are other possibilities (Korean war veterans or founding members of the Econometric Society). Consider any economic relationship of interest that is linear in parameters (but not necessarily in variables). Corresponding to individual behavior, there will exist a cohort version of the relationship of the same form, but with cohort means replacing individual observations. If there are additive individual fixed effects, there will be corresponding additive cohort fixed effects. Further, the sample cohort means from the surveys are consistent but error-ridden estimates of the true cohort means. Hence, provided errors-in-variables techniques are used (and error variances and covariances can be estimated from the surveys), the sample cohort means can be used as panel data for estimating the relationship. Such data are immune to attrition bias and can be extended for long time periods. There is also evidence to suggest that the errors in variables problems may be just as severe for genuine panel data; in the created panels considered here, the problem is controllable. The paper discusses appropriate errors in variables estimators, with and without fixed effects. © 1985.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-46549093197"

While LBS confer greater connectivity and personalization on consumers, they also threaten users' information privacy through granular tracking of their preferences, behaviors, and identity. To address privacy concerns in the LBS context, this study extends the privacy calculus model to explore the role of information delivery mechanisms (pull and push) in the efficacy of three privacy intervention approaches (compensation, industry self-regulation, and government regulation) in influencing individual privacy decision making. The research model was tested using data gathered from 528 respondents through a quasi-experimental survey method. Structural equations modeling using partial least squares validated the instrument and the proposed model. Results suggest that the effects of the three privacy intervention approaches on an individual's privacy calculus vary based on the type of information delivery mechanism (pull and push). Results suggest that providing financial compensation for push-based LBS is more important than it is for pull-based LBS. Moreover, this study shows that privacy advocates and government legislators should not treat all types of LBS as undifferentiated but could instead specifically target certain types of services. © 2010 M.E.

The theoretical framework proposes three distinct psychological benefit categories potentially enhancing consumer attitudes toward green energy brands and increasing purchase intentions: warm glow, self-expressive benefits, and nature experiences. A sample of 726 consumers was exposed to experimental advertisements for a fictitious green energy brand. Findings confirm most predicted effects and underline the overall significance of psychological brand benefits. Only self-expressive benefits do neither affect participants' attitudes toward the experimental brand nor their purchase intentions. Nature experience has the strongest influence on brand attitude. Multi-group structural analysis shows that the nature experiences level evoked by the advertisements moderates the effects of the behavioral antecedents studied on brand attitude and purchase intention.

This research examines the effects of communication strategies a firm can use to mitigate the impact of these inconsistencies on consumer perceptions of corporate hypocrisy and subsequent beliefs about the firm's social responsibility and attitudes toward the firm. Study 1 indicates that a proactive communication strategy (when the firm's CSR statements precede conflicting observed behavior) leads to higher levels of perceived hypocrisy than a reactive strategy (when the firm's CSR statements follow observed behavior). The inconsistent information in both scenarios increases perceptions of hypocrisy, such that CSR statements can actually be counterproductive. Study 1 also reveals how perceived hypocrisy damages consumers' attitudes toward firms by negatively affecting CSR beliefs and provides evidence for the mediating role of hypocrisy during information processing. Study 2 finds that varying CSR policy statement abstractness acts to reduce the hidden risk of proactive communication strategies and can improve the effectiveness of a reactive strategy. Study 3 reveals that an inoculation communication strategy reduces perceived hypocrisy and minimizes its negative consequences, regardless of whether the CSR strategy is proactive or reactive. © 2009, American Marketing Association.","Business ethics; Corporate communications; Corporate hypocrisy; Corporate social responsibility; Retailing","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-70449426741"

As a result, the rather emotive label of 'dark tourism' has entered academic discourse and media parlance, and consequently has generated a significant amount of research interest. However, despite this increasing attention the dark tourism literature remains both eclectic and theoretically fragile. That is, a number of fundamental issues remain, not least whether it is actually possible or justifiable to collectively categorise a diverse range of sites, attractions and exhibitions that are associated with death and the macabre as 'dark tourism', or whether identifiable degrees or 'shades' of darkness can be attributed to a particular type of dark tourism supplier. This paper argues that certain suppliers may indeed, conceptually at least, share particular product features, perceptions and characteristics, which can then be loosely translated into various 'shades of darkness'. As a result, dark tourism products may lie along a rather 'fluid and dynamic spectrum of intensity', whereby particular sites may be conceivably 'darker' than others, dependant upon various defining characteristics, perceptions and product traits. It is proposed that construction of a firm and comprehensive typological foundation will lead not only to a better understanding of dark tourism supply, but also, and perhaps more importantly, lead to a better understanding of where to locate and explore consumer demand, motivations and experiences.","Dark tourism; Death; Framework; Macabre; Product; Supply","perception; tourist attraction; tourist behavior; tourist destination; travel demand","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-33745844522"

Drawing on emotional contagion and emotional labor theories, they investigate the influence of the extent of service employees' display of positive emotions and the authenticity of their emotional labor display on customers' emotional states and, subsequently, on customers' assessments of the service interaction and their relationship with the service provider. To test the study hypotheses, 223 consumers participated in a simulated service encounter in which actors played the roles of service employees. In a 2 × 2 factorial design, the employees varied both the extent of their smiling behavior and their emotional labor display by engaging in surface or deep acting. The results show that the authenticity of employees' emotional labor display directly affects customers' emotional states. However, contrary to expectations, the extent of employee smiling does not influence customer emotions, providing no support for the existence of primitive emotional contagion in service interactions. Furthermore, employee emotions exert an influence on customer outcomes that are of interest to marketers. © 2006, American Marketing Association.","","","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-33746353373"

Findings-This paper suggests that individuals are engaging in online communities in social network platforms both with other individuals and with brands. The study also identifies three key engagement dimensions (cognition, affect and behaviours). Their meaning and sub-dimensions are investigated. The paper further suggests key drivers, one outcome and objects of consumer engagement in online brand communities. These findings are integrated in a conceptual framework. Research limitations/implications-Further research should aim at comparing consumer engagement on different social media and across brand categories, as this study takes a holistic approach and does not focus on any particular category of brands or social media.

Increasing concerns about food security and environmental impacts, such as resource depletion and greenhouse gas emissions attributed to food waste, have intensified attention to the topic. While food waste occurs in all stages of the food supply chain, private households have been identified as key actors in food waste generation. However, the evidence on why food waste occurs remains scattered. This paper maps the still small but expanding academic territory of consumer food waste by systematically reviewing empirical studies on food waste practices as well as distilling factors that foster and impede the generation of food waste on the household level. Moreover, we briefly discuss the contributions of different social ontologies, more particularly psychology-related approaches and social practice theory. The analysis reveals food waste as a complex and multi-faceted issue that cannot be attributed to single variables; this also calls for a stronger integration of different disciplinary perspectives. Mapping the determinants of waste generation deepens the understanding of household practices and helps design food waste prevention strategies. Finally, we link the identified factors with a set of policy, business, and retailer options. © 2018 The Authors","Food behaviour; Food policy; Food practices; Food waste; Sustainable consumption; Systematic literature review","Food supply; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Public policy; Supply chains; Disciplinary perspective; Food policies; Food waste; Policy implications; Private households; Social practice theories; Sustainable consumption; Systematic literature review; Environmental impact","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85043585956"

This relatively new form of word-of-mouth communication, electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) communication, has only recently received significant managerial and academic attention. Many academic studies have looked at the effectiveness of positive eWOM communication, examining the process by which eWOM influences consumer purchasing decisions. eWOM behavior is primarily explained from the individual rational perspective that emphasizes a cost and benefit analysis. However, we felt there was a need for an extensive study that examines consumers' motives for eWOM. In this paper, we focus on the factors that drive consumers to spread positive eWOM in online consumer-opinion platforms. Building on the social psychology literature, we identified a number of key motives of consumers' eWOM intention and developed an associated model. We empirically tested the research model with a sample of 203 members of a consumer review community, OpenRice.com. The model explains 69% of the variance, with reputation, sense of belonging and enjoyment of helping other consumers significantly related to consumers' eWOM intention.

To this end, a conceptual model has been proposed and subjected to empirical verification with the use of a survey. The survey results obtained in two major Chinese cities provide reasonable support for the validity of the proposed model. Specifically, the findings from the structural-equation modeling confirm the influence of the subjects' man-nature orientation, degree of collectivism, ecological affect, and marginally, ecological knowledge, on their attitudes toward green purchases. Their attitudes toward green purchases, in turn, are also seen to affect their green purchase behavior via the mediator of green purchase intention. Although the present findings provide a better understanding of the process and significant antecedents of green purchasing, they also highlight two areas for more thorough investigation. These are the exact role of ecological knowledge in Chinese consumers' green purchasing process and the underlying factors that account for their low level of green purchase.

For consumers, the main potential advantage of electronic shopping over other channels is a reduction in search costs for products and product-related information. Retailers, however, fear that such lowering of consumers' search costs will intensify competition and lower margins by expanding the scope of competition from local to national and international. Some retailers' electronic offerings have been constructed to thwart comparison shopping and to ward off price competition, dimming the appeal of many initial electronic shopping services. Ceteris paribus, if electronic shopping lowers the cost of acquiring price information, it should increase price sensitivity, just as is the case for price advertising. In a similar vein, though, electronic shopping can lower the cost of search for quality information. Most analyses ignore the offsetting potential of the latter effect to lower price sensitivity in the current period. They also ignore the potential of maximally transparent shopping systems to produce welfare gains that give consumers a long-term reason to give repeat business to electronic merchants (cf. Alba et al. 1997, Bakos 1997). We test conditions under which lowered search costs should increase or decrease price sensitivity. We conducted an experiment in which we varied independently three different search costs via electronic shopping: search cost for price information, search cost for quality information within a given store, and search cost for comparing across two competing electronic wine stores. Consumers spent their own money purchasing wines from two competing electronic merchants selling some overlapping and some unique wines. We show four primary empirical results. First, for differentiated products like wines, lowering the cost of search for quality information reduced price sensitivity. Second, price sensitivity for wines common to both stores increased when cross-store comparison was made easy, as many analysts have assumed. However, easy cross-store comparison had no effect on price sensitivity for unique wines. Third, making information environments more transparent by lowering all three search costs produced welfare gains for consumers. They liked the shopping experience more, selected wines they liked more in subsequent tasting, and their retention probability was higher when they were contacted two months later and invited to continue using the electronic shopping service from home. Fourth, we examined the implications of these results for manufacturers and examined how market shares of wines sold by two stores or one were affected by search costs. When store comparison was difficult, results showed that the market share of common wines was proportional to share of distribution; but when store comparison was made easy, the market share returns to distribution decreased significantly. All these results suggest incentives for retailers carrying differentiated goods to make information environments maximally transparent, but to avoid price competition by carrying more unique merchandise.","Buyer behavior; Competitive strategy; Internet marketing; Price sensitivity; Retailing","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0034340424"

Yet the credibility of these reviews is fundamentally undermined when businesses commit review fraud, creating fake reviews for themselves or their competitors. We investigate the economic incentives to commit review fraud on the popular review platform Yelp, using two complementary approaches and data sets. We begin by analyzing restaurant reviews that are identified by Yelp's filtering algorithm as suspicious, or fake-and treat these as a proxy for review fraud (an assumption we provide evidence for). We present four main findings. First, roughly 16% of restaurant reviews on Yelp are filtered. These reviews tend to be more extreme (favorable or unfavorable) than other reviews, and the prevalence of suspicious reviews has grown significantly over time. Second, a restaurant is more likely to commit review fraud when its reputation is weak, i.e., when it has few reviews or it has recently received bad reviews. Third, chain restaurants-which benefit less from Yelp-are also less likely to commit review fraud. Fourth, when restaurants face increased competition, they become more likely to receive unfavorable fake reviews. Using a separate data set, we analyze businesses that were caught soliciting fake reviews through a sting conducted by Yelp. These data support our main results and shed further light on the economic incentives behind a business's decision to leave fake reviews. © 2016 INFORMS.","Advertising and media; Decision making; Economics; Information systems; Marketing; Organizational studies","Consumer behavior; Decision making; Economics; Information systems; Marketing; Consumer reviews; Data set; Data support; Economic incentive; Filtering algorithm; Organizational studies; Restaurant reviews; Crime","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84992187473"

The conceptual model proposes that an adherence to or a violation of these relationship norms influences the appraisal of the specific marketing action and also the overall brand evaluations.

Design/methodology/approach - This paper reviews consumer behaviour and advertising to identify how consumers are persuaded to opt for greener products. It reports the results of a consumer product survey using a questionnaire based on the Dunlap and van Liere HEP-NEP environmental survey and the Roper Starch Worldwide environmental behaviour survey. The respondents were 52 mothers who shop at supermarkets. Findings - The results show a correlation between consumer confidence in the performance of green products and their pro-environmental beliefs in general. The findings suggest that most consumers cannot easily identify greener products (apart from cleaning products) although they would favour products manufactured by greener companies, and they do not find the current product marketing particularly relevant or engaging. Practical implications - The paper suggests that the market for greener products could be exploited more within consumer groups that have pro-environmental values. Originality/value - This paper identifies that consumers are not exposed enough to green product marketing communication and suggests the greater use of marketing and brands to promote and sell products that are environmentally friendly and function effectively. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Beliefs; Brands; Consumer behaviour; Environmental management; Green marketing; Trust","","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-49349111313"

A small group brand community is a friendship group of consumers with a shared enthusiasm for the brand and a well-developed social identity, whose members engage jointly in group actions to accomplish collective goals and/or to express mutual sentiments and commitments. Group activities centered on the brand intermingle with other social activities in these brand communities. A comprehensive model is proposed based on a broadening and deepening of the theory of planned behavior to incorporate social intentions, three aspects of social identity (cognitive self-awareness of membership in the brand community, affective commitment, and evaluative significance of membership), anticipated positive and negative emotions toward achieving or failing to achieve group participation goals, and desire as a transformative mechanism translating reasons for acting into social intentions to do so. The proposed theoretical framework is tested on a sample of 154 members of Harley-Davidson Motorcycle small group brand communities and another sample of 255 members of motorcycle riding groups not organized around specific brands. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Results of a structural analysis revealed that the new model provides a better fit with the data, and explains significantly greater amounts of variance in revisit intention in comparison to the TRA and TPB. Added constructs in the new model considerably contribute to improve our understanding of the complicated process of green hotel customers' decision-making.

Many studies juxtapose consumer emissions (carbon footprint) and producer (territorial) emissions of greenhouse gases in order to demonstrate the effects of trade on the national emission budget. To this end, a respectable number of studies have been undertaken worldwide in order to estimate emissions embedded in international trade of numerous countries and world regions. Input-output approaches, and increasingly multi-region input-output (MRIO) models, are commonly chosen as they provide an appropriate methodological framework for complete carbon footprint estimates at the national and supra-national level. With increasing processing capabilities of computers and a wider availability of economic accounts, environmental accounts and trade data such models are now being implemented on a wide scale. After a brief overview of salient single-region input-output studies I provide an in-depth review of the most recent multi-region input-output models used for the purpose of consumption-based environmental accounting. The main methodological features and important results are described for around twenty studies covering the years 2007 to 2009. This is followed by a detailed review of studies dealing with uncertainty in MRIO analysis, an area which has not received a lot of attention so far. I conclude that further research is mainly needed in two areas, a) improvements in data availability and quality and b) improvements in the accuracy of MRIO modelling. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The research examined four types of perceived risk that were of concern to Internet shoppers and browsers - financial, product performance, psychological, and time/convenience loss risk, the relationship between the types of risk perceived and selected demographics, and the effect of perceived risks on Internet patronage behaviors.

These asymmetries may impede consumers' ability to effectively assess certain types of products, thus creating challenges for online sellers. Signaling theory provides a framework for understanding how extrinsic cues-signals-can be used by sellers to convey product quality information to consumers, reducing uncertainty and facilitating a purchase or exchange. This research proposes a model to investigate website quality as a potential signal of product quality and consider the moderating effects of product information asymmetries and signal credibility. Three experiments are reported that examine the efficacy of signaling theory as a basis for predicting online consumer behavior with an experience good. The results indicate that website quality influences consumers' perceptions of product quality, which subsequently affects online purchase intentions. Additionally, website quality was found to have a greater influence on perceived product quality when consumers had higher information asymmetries. Likewise, signal credibility was found to strengthen the relationship between website quality and product quality perceptions for a high quality website.

Therefore, this study suggests that companies must reduce their greenwash behaviors to enhance their consumers' green trust. In addition, this study finds out that green consumer confusion and green perceived risk mediate the negative relationship between greenwash and green trust. The results also demonstrate that greenwash is positively associated with green consumer confusion and green perceived risk which would negatively affect green trust. It means that greenwash does not only negatively affect green trust directly but also negatively influence it via green consumer confusion and green perceived risk indirectly. Hence, if companies would like to reduce the negative relationship between greenwash and green trust, they need to decrease their consumers' green consumer confusion and green perceived risk. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Green consumer confusion; Green marketing; Green perceived risk; Green trust; Greenwash","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84878585004"

Around age 40, the typical household starts accumulating liquid assets for retirement and its behavior mimics more closely that of a certainty equivalent consumer.

This intentions-behaviour gap is important to researchers and industry, yet poorly understood (Belk et al.: 2005, Consumption, Markets and Culture 8(3), 275-289). In order to push the understanding of ethical consumption forward, we draw on what is known about the intention-behaviour gap from the social psychology and consumer behaviour literatures and apply these insights to ethical consumerism. We bring together three separate insights - implementation intentions (Gollwitzer: 1999, American Psychologist 54(7), 493-503), actual behavioural control (ABC) (Ajzen and Madden: 1986, Journal of Experimental Social Psychology 22, 453-474; Sheeran et al.: 2003, Journal of Social Psychology, 42, 393-410) and situational context (SC) (Belk: 1975, Journal of Consumer Research2, 157-164) - to construct an integrated, holistic conceptual model of the intention-behaviour gap of ethically minded consumers. This holistic conceptual model addresses significant limitations within the ethical consumerism literature, and moves the understanding of ethical consumer behaviour forward. Further, the operationalisation of this model offers insight and strategic direction for marketing managers attempting to bridge the intention-behaviour gap of the ethically minded consumer. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","actual behavioural control; consumer ethics; ethical consumerism; implementation intentions; intention-behaviour gap; perceived behavioural control; situational context; theory of planned behaviour; word-deed gap","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-77957991545"

Donovan and Rossiter's study was exploratory in that student subjects were used and intentions rather than shopping behavior were measured. The present study uses a broader sample of shoppers, measures emotions during the shopping experience rather than before or after, and records the effects on actual shopping behavior. The 1982 study found that experienced pleasantness of the in-store environment was a significant predictor of willingness to spend time in the store and intentions to spend more money than originally planned. This finding was extended behaviorally in the new study: pleasure, as rated five minutes into the shopping duration was a significant predictor of extra time spent in the store and actual incremental spending. Arousal was found to vary in its effects across the two studies and bears further investigation. The effects of the emotional factors of pleasure and arousal were shown to be additional to cognitive factors such as variety and quality of merchandise, price specialing and value for money. The practical significance for retailers is that emotional responses induced by the store environment can affect the time and money that consumers spend in the store. © 1994.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0000672704"

It suggests that the notion of embeddedness requires critical scrutiny and that the implications of the turn to quality for the geography of agriculture may not be as radical as some have suggested. The relationship between quality and local embeddedness is explored in some detail drawing on empirical work on food purchases in five rural localities of England and Wales. It is suggested that the patterns of food purchasing revealed, with local food figuring more highly than organic, illustrate a defensive politics of localism rather than a strong turn to quality based around organic and ecological production. Far from heralding an alternative post-global green future, as promoted by a range of proponents of sustainable agriculture, the turn to local food may cover many different forms of agriculture, encompassing a variety of consumer motivations and giving rise to a wide range of politics. © 200 2 Elsevier Science Ltd.

In parts of Africa and Mesoamerica, maize alone contributes over 20% of food calories. Maize is also a key ingredient in animal feed and is used extensively in industrial products, including the production of biofuels. Increasing demand and production shortfalls in global maize supplies have worsened market volatility and contributed to surging global maize prices. Climatic variability and change, and the consequent rise in abiotic and biotic stresses, further confound the problem. Unless concerted and vigorous measures are taken to address these challenges and accelerate yield growth, the outcome will be hunger and food insecurity for millions of poor consumers. We review the research challenges of ensuring global food security in maize, particularly in the context of climate change. The paper summarizes the importance of maize for food, nutrition and livelihood security and details the historical productivity of maize, consumption patterns and future trends. We show how crop breeding to overcome biotic and abiotic stresses will play a key role in meeting future maize demand. Attention needs to be directed at the generation of high yielding, stress-tolerant and widely-adapted maize varieties through judicious combination of conventional and molecular breeding approaches. The use of improved germplasm per se will not, however, be enough to raise yields and enhance adaptation to climate change, and will need to be complemented by improved crop and agronomic practices. Faced with emasculated state extension provision and imperfect markets, new extension approaches and institutional innovations are required that enhance farmers' access to information, seeds, other inputs, finance and output markets. Over the long-term, large public and private sector investment and sustained political commitment and policy support for technology generation and delivery are needed to overcome hunger, raise the incomes of smallholder farmers and meet the challenges of growing demand for maize at the global level. © 2011 The Author(s).","Climate change; Crop breeding; Demand; Food security; Maize; Policy; Productivity growth","Africa; Mesoamerica; Animalia; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays; agricultural economics; agricultural market; agricultural policy; agricultural worker; agronomy; biofuel; climate change; consumption behavior; crop production; crop yield; developing world; environmental stress; food consumption; food security; food supply; future prospect; germplasm; global perspective; high yielding variety; industrial production; innovation; investment; maize; pasture; plant breeding; productivity; smallholder; volatilization","Review","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-80052085879"

In contrast, buffer-stock consumers set average consumption growth equal to average labor income growth, regardless of tastes. The model can explain three empirical puzzles: the ""consumption/income parallel"" documented by Carroll and Summers; the ""consumption/income divergence"" first documented in the 1930s; and the stability of the household age/wealth profile over time despite the unpredictability of idiosyncratic wealth changes.","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-0038969196"

Emotions consist of two independent dimensions, i.e. pleasure and arousal. Two competing models were tested. The first model is derived from the environmental psychology research stream as developed by (An Approach to Environmental Psychology, MIT Press, Cambridge, 1974), where the visitor's arousal generates pleasure and, in turn, approach/avoidance behaviour. This emotion-cognition model is supported by Zajonc and Markus (1984). The second model to be tested is based on Lazarus' (Emotion and Adaptation, Oxford University Press, New York, 1991) cognitive theory of emotions. In this latter model, emotions are elicited by visitors' disconfirmation of the theme park. Using confirmatory factor analysis, it was supported that the cognitive theory of emotions better explains the effect of pleasure on satisfaction and loyalty. Additionally, consumers' willingness to pay more for the service is more likely to be induced by disconfirmation than by satisfaction alone. Managerial implications concerning the cognitive-affective sequence of satisfaction are discussed. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The model considers not only how consumers formulate their prepurchase decisions, but also how they form their long-term relationships with the same website vendor by comparing their prepurchase expectations to their actual purchase outcome. The results indicate that trust directly and indirectly affects a consumer's purchase decision in combination with perceived risk and perceived benefit, and also that trust has a longer term impact on consumer e-loyalty through satisfaction. Thus, this study extends our understanding of consumer Internet transaction behavior as a three-fold (prepurchase, purchase, and postpurchase) process, and it recognizes the crucial, multiple roles that trust plays in this process. Implications for theory and practice as well as limitations and future directions are discussed. ©2009 INFORMS.","Consumer satisfaction; E-loyalty; Expectation-confirmation theory; Extended valence framework; Purchase and repurchase intentions in B2C e-commerce; Trust in e-commerce","Commerce; Electronic commerce; Sales; Consumer satisfactions; E-loyalty; Expectation Confirmation Theory; Extended valence framework; Repurchase intention; Consumer behavior","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-67649557443"

Data was collected by means of an online survey implemented in the UK, France, Germany, Spain, Sweden, and Poland, with a total sample size of 4408 respondents. Respondents expressed medium high to high levels of concern with sustainability issues at the general level, but lower levels of concern in the context of concrete food product choices. Understanding of the concept of sustainability was limited, but understanding of four selected labels (Fair Trade, Rainforest Alliance, Carbon Footprint, and Animal Welfare) was better, as some of them seem to be self-explanatory. The results indicated a low level of use, no matter whether use was measured as self-reported use of different types of information available on food labels or as use inferred from the results of a choice-based conjoint analysis. Hierarchical regression indicated that use is related to both motivation and understanding, and that both motivation, understanding and use are affected by demographic characteristics, human values as measured by the Schwartz value domains, and country differences. The results imply that sustainability labels currently do not play a major role in consumers' food choices, and future use of these labels will depend on the extent to which consumers' general concern about sustainability can be turned into actual behaviour. © 2013 The Authors.","Consumer behaviour; Food labelling; Sustainability","France; Germany; Poland; Spain; Sweden; United Kingdom; food consumption; preference behavior; regression analysis; sustainability","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84891362152"

In this paper, we focus on the interaction between a manufacturer's reverse channel choice to collect postconsumer goods and the strategic product pricing decisions in the forward channel when retailing is competitive. To this end, we model a direct product collection system, in which the manufacturer collects used products directly from the consumers (e.g., print and copy cartridges) and an indirect product collection system, in which the retailers act as product return points (e.g., single-use cameras, cellular phones). We first examine how the allocation of product collection to retailers impacts their strategic behavior in the product market, and we discuss the economic trade-offs the manufacturer faces while choosing an optimal reverse channel structure. When a direct collection system is used, channel profits are driven by the impact of scale of returns on collection effort, whereas in the indirect reverse channel, supply chain profits are driven by the competitive interaction between the retailers. Subsequently, we show that the buy-back payments transfered to the retailers for postconsumer goods provide a wholesale pricing flexibility that can be used to price discriminate between retailers of different profitability. © 2006 INFORMS.","Distribution channels; Product remanufacturing; Reverse logistics; Supply chain coordination","Consumer products; Decision making; Management science; Product development; Reverse engineering; Strategic planning; Distribution channels; Product remanufacturing; Reverse logistics; Supply chain coordination; Retail stores","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-33644518981"

Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected from customers at an authentic upscale Chinese restaurant located in a Southeastern state in the USA via a self-administered questionnaire. Anderson and Gerbing's two-step approach was used to assess the measurement and structural models. Findings: Structural equation modeling shows that the quality of the physical environment, food, and service were significant determinants of restaurant image. Also, the quality of the physical environment and food were significant predictors of customer perceived value. The restaurant image was also found to be a significant antecedent of customer perceived value. In addition, the results reinforced that customer perceived value is indeed a significant determinant of customer satisfaction, and customer satisfaction is a significant predictor of behavioral intentions. Research limitations/implications: The proposed model and study findings will greatly help researchers and practitioners understand the complex relationships among foodservice quality (physical environment, food, and service), restaurant image, customer perceived value, customer satisfaction, and behavioral intentions in the restaurant industry. Originality/value: This study is the first to develop an integrated model that explicitly accounts for the influence of three restaurant service quality factors on restaurant image and customer perceived value. Using structural equation modeling, this study empirically confirms that the model with the causality from quality, in particular three dimensions of foodservice quality in this study, to restaurant image is superior to the one with causality from image to quality in the context of restaurant. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","and service); Behavioral intentions; Consumer behaviour; Customer perceived value; Customer satisfaction; Customer services quality; food; Foodservice quality dimensions (physical environment; Restaurant image; Satisfaction; United States of America","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84859171057"

The model was tested using mainland Chinese consumers' attitudes toward Japan and Japanese products. Structural equation modeling supports the model and shows that animosity has a significant impact on buying decisions above and beyond the effect of consumer ethnocentrism.

Theoretical approaches in psychology agree that prioritizing money and associated aims is negatively associated with individuals' well-being but differ in their implications for whether this is invariably the case. To address these and other questions, we examined 753 effect sizes from 259 independent samples. Materialism was associated with significantly lower well-being for the most widely used, multifaceted measures (materialist values and beliefs, r = -.19, ρ = -.24; relative importance of materialist goals, r = -.16, ρ = -.21), more than for measures assessing emphasis on money alone (rs = -.08 to -.11, ρs = -.09 to -.14). The relationship also depended on type of well-being outcome, with largest effects for risky health and consumer behaviors and for negative self-appraisals (rs = -.28 to -.44, ρs = -.32 to -.53) and weakest effects for life satisfaction and negative affect (rs = -.13 to -.15, ρs = -.17 to -.18). Moderator analyses revealed that the strength of the effect depended on certain demographic factors (gender and age), on value context (study/work environments that support materialistic values and cultures that emphasize affective autonomy), and on cultural economic indicators (economic growth and wealth differentials). Mediation analyses suggested that the negative link may be explained by poor psychological need satisfaction. We discuss implications for the measurement of materialist values and the need for theoretical and empirical advances to explore underlying processes, which likely will require more experimental, longitudinal, and developmental research. © 2014 American Psychological Association.","Consumer behaviors; Materialism; Meta-analysis; Personal well-being; Values","Adult; Attitude; Consumer Behavior; Humans; Personal Satisfaction; Self Concept; Social Values; adult; attitude; consumer attitude; human; meta analysis; satisfaction; self concept; social psychology","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84925447283"

At the same time, spam and e-mail-based viruses have cluttered electronic communications, making viral marketing campaigns problematic and challenging to deploy. The key driver in viral marketing is the effectiveness of unsolicited, electronic referrals to create awareness, trigger interest, and generate sales or product adoption. Yet, despite a large literature concerning interpersonal influence, little is known about how this electronic, or, indeed, any word-of-mouth process influences consumers' actual behaviors, particularly in a cluttered online environment. In this paper, we develop a model to help identify the role word-of-mouth plays during each stage of a viral marketing recipients' decision-making process, including the conditions that moderate such influence. We then present an innovative methodology for collecting data unobtrusively and in real time. We empirically test the model and methodology via a field study, where we observed the reactions of 1100 individuals after they received an unsolicited e-mail from one of their acquaintances, inviting them to take a survey and in turn spread the word about it. We found that characteristics of the social tie influenced recipients' behaviors, but had different effects at different stages: tie strength facilitated awareness, perceptual affinity triggered recipients' interest, and demographic similarity had a negative influence on each stage of the decision-making process. We conclude with a discussion of the theoretical and methodological contributions of our work and of managerial implications of these findings for online marketers interested in strategies for leveraging peer-to-peer referral networks. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Based on this general framework capturing all stages of the electronic service delivery process, we develop a transaction process-based scale for measuring service quality (eTransQual). After conducting exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, we identify five discriminant quality dimensions: functionality/design, enjoyment, process, reliability and responsiveness. All extracted dimensions of eTransQual show a significant positive impact on important outcome variables like perceived value and customer satisfaction. Moreover, enjoyment is a dominant factor in influencing both relationship duration and repurchase intention as major drivers of customer lifetime value.

This shift is made possible by the widespread adoption of Internet technologies, but it is less about technology than about the fact that a new behavior is reaching critical mass. Millions of people are communicating at home and at work in an explosion of connectivity that threatens to undermine the established value chains for businesses in many sectors of the economy. What will happen, for instance, to dominant retailers such as Toys ""R"" Us and Home Depot when a search through the Internet gives consumers more choice than any store? What will be the point of cultivating a long-standing supplier relationship with General Electric when it posts its purchasing requirements on an Internet bulletin board and entertains bids from anybody inclined to respond? The authors present a conceptual framework for approaching such questions--for understanding the relationship of information to the physical components of the value chain and how the Internet's ability to separate the two will lead to the reconfiguration of the value proposition in many industries. In any business where the physical value chain has been compromised for the sake of delivering information, there will be an opportunity to create a separate information business and a need to streamline the physical one. Executives must mentally deconstruct their businesses to see the real value of what they have.

Several higher education institutions have recently recognized the importance of integrating sustainability issues into education to make this impact focused and explicit. This paper explores the relationship strength between environmental education and environmental knowledge, attitudes and reported actual behavior of university and high school students, providing a comparative questionnaire survey analysis which is unique in the literature. The results show a strong correlation between the intensity of environmental education and the environmental knowledge of students. This is partly due to the environmental education itself and partly due to the higher intrinsic motivation of committed students who voluntarily participate in environmental education, primarily at university level. The focus of the environmental education appears to be important in shaping attitudes about sustainable consumption. Addressing the issue of consumerism in environmental education clearly increases awareness of the need for consumption-related lifestyle changes. Based on Multidimensional Scaling methodology, the interdependence of several influencing variables is explored and illustrated graphically. Respondents are classified into five clusters - hedonist, techno-optimist, active environmentalist, familiar and careless - according to their environmental knowledge, attitudes, consumer behavior and everyday environmental awareness. Consistencies and inconsistencies in behavior are then identified in order to promote the creation of more effective educational instruments for supporting sustainable consumption and lifestyles. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Three studies were conducted to: test a protocol for developing product category specific measures of brand image; investigate the dimensionality of the brand associations construct; and explore whether the degree of dimensionality of brand associations varies depending upon a brand's familiarity. Findings confirm the efficacy of the brand image protocol and indicate that brand associations differ across brands and product categories.

Despite the mounting interest of researchers and practitioners, the resulting scholarly work remains divergent, partial and fragmented. In light of the pivotal role of SMIs on the consumer decision journey and as this research domain is still developing, a comprehensive and critical overview of extant research on this topic is sorely needed. In response, this paper is the first to consolidate the present state of research on IM within social media settings. More specifically, a systematic review of relevant studies published in peer-reviewed academic journals across diverse fields was conducted in order to identify key themes and dominant concepts. The analysis of 68 articles from 29 Chartered Association of Business Schools-ranked journals forges a robust understanding of this phenomenon, shedding light on the mechanisms underlying the appeal of SMIs and their influential power in shaping consumer attitudes and behaviour. Based on the analysis, an integrative multidimensional framework is presented that considers antecedents, mediators and moderators of potential outcomes, as well as contextual factors that translate into consumer behaviour. In so doing, various research gaps are identified and avenues for future research are proposed that reflect important emerging areas and unexplored realms with reference to theory, context and methodology.

This article reports research on exactly how, and how much, trust influences consumer decisions to buy new green products. It identifies consumer trust as a distinct volition factor influencing the likelihood that consumers will act on green intentions and strongly emphasizes the needs to manage consumer trust as a prerequisite for the development of a market for green products. Specifically, based on a mixture of qualitative and quantitative methods, it is found that lack of consumer trust is a barrier for the development of a market for organic food in Thailand. Two focus groups and ten in-depth interviews revealed low knowledge about and low trust in organic food, certification, control, and labeling. Further, a mall-intercept survey (N = 177) revealed that lack of (especially) system trust reduces consumer expectations about benefits of buying organic food, and it makes them less likely to buy organic food. Mistrust in the control system and in the authenticity of food sold as organic has a significant negative impact on self-reported buying behavior.

Design/methodology/approach - First, there is an explanation of the main attributes of the concepts examined, with special attention being paid to the multi-dimensional nature of the variables and the relationships between them. This is followed by an examination of the validation processes of the measuring instruments. Findings - The validation process of scales suggested that perceived quality is a multidimensional construct: web design, customer service, assurance and order management; that perceived quality influences on satisfaction; and that satisfaction influences on consumer loyalty. Moreover, no differences in these conclusions were observed if the total sample is divided between buyers and information searchers. Practical implications - First, the need to develop user-friendly web sites which ease consumer purchasing and searching, thus creating a suitable framework for the generation of higher satisfaction and loyalty levels. Second, the web site manager should enhance service loyalty, customer sensitivity, personalised service and a quick response to complaints. Third, the web site should uphold sufficient security levels in communications and meet data protection requirements regarding the privacy. Lastly, the need for correct product delivery and product manipulation or service is recommended. Originality/value - Most relevant studies about perceived quality in the internet have focused on web design aspects. Moreover, the existing literature regarding internet consumer behaviour has not fully analysed profits generated by higher perceived quality in terms of user satisfaction and loyalty.","Consumer behaviour; Customer satisfaction; Electronic commerce; Internet; User studies","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-34249305509"

At the same time, differences in the type of information sought for search and experience goods can precipitate differences in the process through which consumers gather information and make decisions online. A preliminary experiment shows that though there are significant differences in consumers' perceived ability to evaluate product quality before purchase between search and experience goods in traditional retail environments, these differences are blurred in online environments. An analysis of the online behavior of a representative sample of U.S. consumers shows that consumers spend similar amounts of time online gathering information for both search and experience goods, but there are important differences in the browsing and purchase behavior of consumers for these two types of goods. In particular, experience goods involve greater depth (time per page) and lower breadth (total number of pages) of search than search goods. In addition, free riding (purchasing from a retailer other than the primary source of product information) is less frequent for experience than for search goods. Finally, the presence of product reviews from other consumers and multimedia that enable consumers to interact with products before purchase has a greater effect on consumer search and purchase behavior for experience than for search goods. © 2009, American Marketing Association.","Browsing behavior; Experience goods; Information search; Internet; Multimedia","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-62649092010"

We analyze a novel dataset from three U.S. health clubs with information on both the contractual choice and the day-to-day attendance decisions of 7,752 members over three years. The observed consumer behavior is difficult to reconcile with standard preferences and beliefs. First, members who choose a contract with a flat monthly fee of over $70 attend on average 4.3 times per month. They pay a price per expected visit of more than $17, even though they could pay $10 per visit using a 10-visit pass. On average, these users forgo savings of $600 during their membership. Second, consumers who choose a monthly contract are 17 percent more likely to stay enrolled beyond one year than users committing for a year. This is surprising because monthly members pay higher fees for the option to cancel each month. We also document cancellation delays and attendance expectations, among other findings. Leading explanations for our findings are overconfidence about future self-control or about future efficiency. Overconfident agents overestimate attendance as well as the cancellation probability of automatically renewed contracts. Our results suggest that making inferences from observed contract choice under the rational expectation hypothesis can lead to biases in the estimation of consumer preferences.","","","Review","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-33744548714"

Drawing upon the heuristic-systematic model from the literature of dual-process theories, we develop a research model to identify factors that are important to consumers' purchase decision-making. The model is empirically tested with 191 users of an existing online review site. We find that argument quality of online reviews (systematic factor), which is characterized by perceived informativeness and perceived persuasiveness, has a significant effect on consumers' purchase intention. In addition, we find that source credibility and perceived quantity of reviews (heuristic factors) have direct impacts on purchase intention. The two heuristic factors further demonstrate positive influences on argument strength. This result is consistent with the proposition of bias effect in the heuristic-systematic model, which elucidates the interrelationship between heuristic and systematic factors. Based on the findings, we discuss implications for both researchers and practitioners. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Firms whose products are being discussed in such forums are therefore tempted to manipulate consumer perceptions by posting costly anonymous messages that praise their products. This paper offers a theoretical analysis of the impact of such behavior on firm profits and consumer surplus. There are three main results. First, if every firm's manipulation strategy is a monotonically increasing (decreasing) function of that firm's true quality, strategic manipulation of online forums increases (decreases) the information value of a forum to consumers. This result implies the existence of settings where online forum manipulation benefits consumers. Second, equilibria where strategies are monotonically increasing (decreasing) functions of a firm's true quality exist in settings where the firm's net payoff function, inclusive of the cost of manipulation, is supermodular (submodular) in the firm's quality and manipulation action. Third, in a broad class of settings, if the precision of honest consumer opinions that firms manipulate is sufficiently high, firms of all types, as well as society, would be strictly better off if manipulation of online forums was not possible. Nonetheless, firms are locked into a ""rat race"" and forced to spend resources on such profit-reducing activities; if they don't, consumer perceptions will be biased against them. The social cost of online manipulation can be reduced by developing ""filtering"" technologies that make it costlier for firms to manipulate. Interestingly, as the amount of user-contributed online content increases, it is firms, and not consumers, that have most to gain from the development of such technologies. © 2006 INFORMS.","Electronic commerce; Manipulation; Online product reviews; Word of mouth","Decision making; Internet; Online systems; Production engineering; Purchasing; Internet opinion forums; Manipulation; Online product reviews; Electronic commerce","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-33749684670"

The study comprises a review of 502 articles - published in peer-reviewed journals from 2000 to 2019. Citation network, page-rank analysis, co-citation analysis, content analysis and publication trends have been employed to identify influential work, delineate the intellectual structure of the field and identify gaps. The most prominent journals, authors, countries, articles and themes have been identified using bibliometric analysis, followed by a comprehensive analysis of the content of 107 papers in the identified clusters. The three major themes enumerated are—levels of financial literacy amongst distinct cohorts, the influence that financial literacy exerts on financial planning and behaviour, and the impact of financial education. Additionally, content analysis of 175 papers has been conducted for the last four years’ articles that were not covered in the co-citation analysis. Emerging themes identified include financial capability, financial inclusion, gender gap, tax & insurance literacy, and digital financial education. A conceptual framework has been modelled portraying the complete picture, following which potential areas of research have been suggested. This study will help policy-makers, regulators and academic researchers know the nuts and bolts of financial literacy, and identify the relevant areas that need investigation. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","bibliometric analysis; consumer economics; financial education; financial knowledge; financial literacy; systematic literature review","","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85088967690"

Assessing the potential uptake of these new categories of vehicles requires an understanding of likely consumer responses. Previous in-depth explorations of appraisals and evaluations of electric vehicles have tended to focus on 'early adopters', who may not represent mainstream consumers. This paper reports a qualitative analysis of responses to electric cars, based on semi-structured interviews conducted with 40 UK non-commercial drivers (20 males, 20 females; age 24-70years) at the end of a seven-day period of using a battery electric car (20 participants) or a plug-in hybrid car (20 participants). Six core categories of response were identified: (1) cost minimisation; (2) vehicle confidence; (3) vehicle adaptation demands; (4) environmental beliefs; (5) impression management; and, underpinning all other categories, (6) the perception of electric cars generally as 'work in progress' products. Results highlight potential barriers to the uptake of current-generation (2010) plug-in electric cars by mainstream consumers. These include the prioritization of personal mobility needs over environmental benefits, concerns over the social desirability of electric vehicle use, and the expectation that rapid technological and infrastructural developments will make current models obsolete. Implications for the potential uptake of future electric vehicles are discussed. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Attitudes; Electric vehicles; Identity; Mainstream adoption; Marketing; Technology","United Kingdom; Automobiles; Automotive batteries; Battery electric vehicles; Electric vehicles; Marketing; Plug-in electric vehicles; Attitudes; Environmental benefits; Identity; Impression management; Infrastructural development; Internal combustion engine vehicles; Mainstream adoption; Semi structured interviews; automobile; carbon dioxide; comparative study; consumption behavior; electric vehicle; emission inventory; infrastructural development; marketing; mobility; perception; qualitative analysis; technological development; Plug-in hybrid vehicles","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-80053934321"

It also examines the sharing economy’s impact on marketing’s traditional beliefs and practices in terms of how it challenges three key foundations of marketing: institutions (e.g., consumers, firms and channels, regulators), processes (e.g., innovation, branding, customer experience, value appropriation), and value creation (e.g., value for consumers, value for firms, value for society) and offers future research directions designed to push the boundaries of marketing thought. The article concludes with a set of forward-looking guideposts that highlight the implications of the sharing economy’s paradoxes, maturation, and technological development for marketing research.

Addressing theoreticians and practitioners alike, this paper uses multiple empirical methods to show that consumers voluntarily and strategically ration their purchase quantities of goods that are likely to be consumed on impulse and that therefore may pose self-control problems. For example, many regular smokers buy their cigarettes by the pack, although they could easily afford to buy 10-pack cartons. These smokers knowingly forgo sizable per-unit savings from quantity discounts, which they could realize if they bought cartons; by rationing their purchase quantities, they also self-impose additional transactions costs on marginal consumption, which makes excessive smoking overly difficult and costly. Such strategic self-imposition of constraints is intuitively appealing yet theoretically problematic. The marketing literature lacks operationalizations and empirical tests of such consumption self-control strategies and of their managerial implications. This paper provides experimental evidence of the operation of consumer self-control and empirically illustrates its direct implications for the pricing of consumer goods. Moreover, the paper develops a conceptual frame-work for the design of empirical tests of such self-imposed constraints on consumption in consumer goods markets. Within matched pairs of products, we distinguish relative ""virtue"" and ""vice"" goods whose preference ordering changes with whether consumers evaluate immediate or delayed consumption consequences. For example, ignoring long-term health effects, many smokers prefer regular (relative vice) to light (relative virtue) cigarettes, because they prefer the taste of the former. However, ignoring these short-term taste differences, the same smokers prefer light to regular cigarettes when they consider the long-term health effects of smoking. These preference orders can lead to dynamically inconsistent consumption choices by consumers whose tradeoffs between the immediate and delayed consequences of consumption depend on the time lag between purchase and consumption. This creates a potential self-control problem, because these consumers will be tempted to overconsume the vices they have in stock at home. Purchase quantity rationing helps them solve the self-control Problem by limiting their stock and hence their consumption opportunities. Such rationing implies that, per purchase occasion, vice consumers will be less likely than virtue consumers to buy larger quantities in response to unit price reductions such as quantity discounts. We first test this prediction in two laboratory experiments. We then examine the external validity of the results at the retail level with a field survey of quantity discounts and with a scanner data analysis of chain-wide store-level demand across a variety of different pairs of matched vice (regular) and virtue (reduced fat, calorie, or caffeine, etc.) product categories. The analyses of these experimental, field, and scanner data provide strong convergent evidence of a characteristic crossover in demand schedules for relative vices and virtues for categories as diverse as, among others, potato chips, chocolate chip cookies, cream cheese, beer, soft drinks, ice cream and frozen yogurt, chewing gum, coffee, and beef and turkey bologna. Vice consumers' demand increases less in response to price reductions than virtue consumers' demand, although their preferences are not generally weaker for vices than for virtues. Constraints on vice purchases are self-imposed and strategic rather than driven by simple preferences. We suggest that rationing their vice inventories at the point of purchase allows consumers to limit subsequent consumption. As a result of purchase quantity rationing, however, vice buyers forgo savings from price reductions through quantity discounts, effectively paying price premiums for the opportunity to engage in self-control. Thus, purchase quantity rationing vice consumers are relatively price insensitive. From a managerial and public policy perspective, our findings should offer marketing practitioners in many consumer goods industries new opportunities to increase profits through segmentation and price discrimination based on consumer self-control. They can charge premium prices for small sizes of vices, relative to the corresponding quantity discounts for virtues. Virtue consumers, on the other hand, will buy larger amounts even when quantity discounts are relatively shallow. A key conceptual contribution of this paper lies in showing how marketing researchers can investigate a whole class of strategic self-constraining consumer behaviors empirically. Moreover, this research is the first to extend previous, theoretical work on impulse control by empirically demonstrating its broader implications for marketing decision making.","Intertemporal choice; Pricing policy; Product policy; Segmentation; Self-control","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0032250953"

Hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), as an energy-efficient transport innovation, have the potential to reduce gasoline consumption, carbon emissions and alleviate environmental problems. Diffusion of HEVs’ adoption is a significant initiative. A sample of 433 respondents has been collected in China to predict the customers’ intention to adopt HEVs, using an extended model of the theory of planned behavior (TPB). The empirical results show that the attitude toward HEVs, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control (the three primary elements of the TPB model) and personal moral norm partially mediate the effect of consumers’ environmental concern on their intention to adopt HEVs. Consumers’ environmental concern affects the adoption intention indirectly and is significantly positively related to the attitude toward HEVs, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control and personal moral norm, which in turn influence the adoption intention positively. The results confirm the appropriateness of the TPB model and verify that the extended TPB model has good explanatory power in predicting consumers’ intention to adopt HEVs. Based on the empirical results, we discuss the implications for promoting the adoption of HEVs and provide suggestions for future study. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Environmental concern; Extended theory of planned behavior; Hybrid electric vehicles; Personal moral norm","China; Carbon; Consumer behavior; Electric vehicles; Energy efficiency; Forecasting; Transportation; Adoption intention; Environmental concerns; Environmental problems; Extended versions; Hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs); Perceived behavioral control; Personal moral norm; Theory of Planned Behavior; carbon emission; electric vehicle; emission control; energy use; future prospect; technology adoption; technology diffusion; Hybrid vehicles","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84952298886"

A challenge is to continue to refine long-horizon methods. This chapter also presents new evidence illustrating that properties of event study methods can vary by calendar time period and can depend on event sample firm characteristics such as volatility. This reinforces the importance of using stratified samples to examine event study statistical properties.

Understanding the ways in which brands can preserve the one-to-one characteristics and intimate relationship qualities offered by social media while still meeting consumer expectations amidst the escalating volume of interactions has become essential. Drawing on the communications literature, this research proposes that parasocial interaction (PSI) theory may be used as a theoretical lens for designing successful social media strategies. Three studies, using a multi-method approach, provide evidence of PSI's role in the development of positive relationship outcomes. Mediation analysis reveals that this sense of feeling connected with the brand goes beyond the interaction itself and drives increased feelings of loyalty intentions and willingness to provide information to the brand. Evidence from this research suggests that these effects may not hold when consumers are aware of the possibility that the brand's social media response may be automated. These findings offer marketers theoretical guidance for fostering relationships in social media environments. © 2013.","Brand loyalty; Interactivity; Online consumer behavior; Openness in communication; Parasocial interaction; Social media; Willingness to provide information","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84900495277"

Although it has been established that consumers do, in fact, experience flow while using the Web, consumer researchers do not as yet have a comprehensive understanding of the specific activities during which consumers actually have these experiences. One fruitful focus of research on online consumer experience has been on two distinct categories of consumption behavior - Goal directed and experiential consumption behavior. Drawing distinctions between these behaviors for the Web may be particularly important because the experiential process is, for many individuals, as or even more important than the final instrumental result. However, the general and broad nature of flow measurement to date has precluded a precise investigation of flow during goal-directed versus experiential activities. In this article, we explore this issue, investigating whether flow occurs during both experiential and goal-directed activities, if experiential and goal-directed flow states differ in terms of underlying constructs, and what the key characteristics are - Based on prior theory - That define ""types"" of flow experiences reported on the Web. Our approach is to perform a series of quantitative analyses of qualitative descriptions of flow experiences provided by Web users collected in conjunction with the 10th GVU WWW User Survey. In contrast with previous research that suggests flow would be more likely to occur during recreational activities than task-oriented activities, we found more evidence of flow for task-oriented rather than experiential activities, although there is evidence flow occurs under both scenarios. As a final note, we argue that the role that goal-directed and experiential activities may play in facilitating the creation of compelling online environments may also be important in a broader consumer policy context.","","","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0038120970"

This article develops an integrative framework of the concept of brand authenticity and reports the development and validation of a scale measuring consumers' perceived brand authenticity (PBA). A multi-phase scale development process resulted in a 15-item PBA scale measuring four dimensions: credibility, integrity, symbolism, and continuity. This scale is reliable across different brands and cultural contexts. We find that brand authenticity perceptions are influenced by indexical, existential, and iconic cues, whereby some of the latters' influence is moderated by consumers' level of marketing skepticism. Results also suggest that PBA increases emotional brand attachment and word-of-mouth, and that it drives brand choice likelihood through self-congruence for consumers high in self-authenticity. © 2014 Society for Consumer Psychology.

The objectives of the review were to: systematically collect, document, scrutinise and critically analyse the current research literature on supply-side higher education marketing; establish the scope of higher education marketing; identify gaps in the research literature; and make recommendations for further research in this field. Design/methodology/approach - The approach for this study entailed extensive searches of relevant business management and education databases. The intention was to ensure that, as far as possible, all literature in the field was identified - while keeping the focus on literature of greatest pertinence to the research questions. Findings - The paper finds that potential benefits of applying marketing theories and concepts that have been effective in the business world are gradually being recognised by researchers in the field of HE marketing. However, the literature on HE marketing is incoherent, even inchoate, and lacks theoretical models that reflect upon the particular context of HE and the nature of their services. Research limitations/implications - The research field of HE marketing is still at a relatively pioneer stage with much research still to be carried out both from a problem identification and strategic erspective. Originality/value - Despite the substantial literature on the marketisation of HE and consumer behaviour, scholarship to provide evidence of the marketing strategies that have been implemented by HE institutions on the supply-side remains limited, and this is relatively uncharted territory.

Improvements to lead-user theory are needed to inform and to guide these efforts. The present study empirically tests and confirms the basic tenets of lead-user theory. It also uncovers some new refinements and related practical applications. Using a sample of users and user-innovators drawn from the extreme sport of kite surfing, an analysis was made of the relationship between the commercial attractiveness of innovations developed by users and the intensity of the lead-user characteristics those users display. A first empirical analysis is provided of the independent effects of its two key component variables. In the empirical study of user modifications to kite-surfing equipment, it was found that both components independently contribute to identifying commercially attractive user innovations. Component 1, the high expected-benefits dimension, predicts innovation likelihood, and component 2, the ahead of the trend dimension, predicts both the commercial attractiveness of a given set of user-developed innovations and innovation likelihood due to a newly proposed innovation supply side effect. It was concluded that the component variables in the lead-user definition are indeed independent dimensions, so neither can be dropped without loss of information-an important matter for lead-user theory. It also was found that adding measures of users' local resources can improve the ability of the lead-user construct to identify commercially attractive innovations under some conditions. The findings reported here have practical as well as theoretical import. Product modification and development has been found to be a relatively common user behavior in many fields. Thus, from 10 to nearly 40 percent of users report having modified or developed a product for in-house use in the case of industrial products or for personal use in the case of consumer products in fields sampled to date. As a practical matter, therefore, it is important to find ways to selectively identify the user innovations that manufacturers will find to be the basis for commercially attractive products in the collectivity of user-developed innovations. The implications of these findings for theory as well as for practical applications of the lead-user construct are discussed - that is, how variables used in lead-user studies can profitably be adapted to fit specific study contexts and purposes. © 2006 Product Development & Management Association.","","Consumer products; Information analysis; Lead; Product development; Innovation likelihood; Lead-user theory; Product modification; Information theory","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-33745306228"

What drives people to committing adultery even though they inherently believe this is wrong? What’s the outcome of this contradiction in the mind? Cognitive dissonance has been an important and influential theory since Leon Festinger published his classic work in 1957. It is known by every social psychologist, most psychologists of any stripe, and the lay public, making its way into such mainstream publications as The New York Times with increasing frequency and accuracy. Ultimately, dissonance has become one of the most popularly known expressions of social psychological insights, making its way into the literature in consumer, health and economic behavior, and has become a frequently used explanation of political behavior in the popular press and magazines.

More specifically the moderator effect of elaboration upon the relationship between two different types of consumer satisfaction and true brand loyalty is investigated. First, in defining brand loyalty, a distinction is made between repeat purchasing behavior and brand loyalty. Next, true brand loyalty is distinguished from spurious brand loyalty. Second, two types of consumer satisfaction are distinguished based on the amount of elaboration upon the evaluation of the brand choice: manifest satisfaction and latent satisfaction. It is hypothesized that the positive relationship between manifest satisfaction and true brand loyalty is stronger than the positive relationship between latent satisfaction and true brand loyalty. In other words, a moderator effect of the amount of elaboration upon the relationship between consumer satisfaction and true brand loyalty is expected and found. Also, some other effects are found indicating that the relationship between consumer satisfaction and brand loyalty is not simple and straightforward. © 1995.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0001202037"

The research in this article reconsidered such behavior as deficient self-regulation within the framework of A. Bandura's (1991) theory of self-regulation. In this framework, behavior patterns that have been called media addictions lie at one extreme of a continuum of unregulated media behavior that extends from normally impulsive media consumption patterns to extremely problematic behavior that might properly be termed pathological. These unregulated media behaviors are the product of deficient self-regulatory processes through which media consumers monitor, judge, and adjust their own behavior, processes that may be found in all media consumers. The impact of deficient self-regulation on media behavior was examined in a sample of 465 college students. A measure of deficient self-regulation drawn from the diagnostic criteria used in past studies of pathological Internet usage was significantly and positively correlated to Internet use across the entire range of consumption, including among normal users who showed relatively few of the ""symptoms."" A path analysis demonstrated that depression and media habits formed to alleviate depressed moods undermined self-regulation and led to increased Internet usage.","","","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0042074089"

They were surveyed on their green purchasing behaviour, environmental attitude, environmental concern, perceived seriousness of environmental problems, perceived environmental responsibility, perceived effectiveness of environmental behaviour, social influence and concern for self-image in environmental protection. Findings - Multipleregression analysis showed that social influence was the top predictor of Hong Kong adolescents' green purchasing behaviour, followed by environmental concern as the second, concern for self-image in environmental protection as the third, and perceived environmental responsibility as the fourth top predictor. Research limitations/implications - A major limitation of this study lies in the self-reported nature of the survey used. Future study should include some objective assessments (such as observations or other-reported survey) of the subjects' green purchasing behaviour.

In our models, both usage experience and advertising exposure give consumers noisy signals about brand attributes. Consumers use these signals to update their expectations of brand attributes in a Bayesian manner. The two models are (1) a dynamic model with immediate utility maximization, and (2) a dynamic ""forward-looking"" model in which consumers maximize the expected present value of utility over a planning horizon. Given this theoretical framework, we derive from the Bayesian learning framework how brand choice probabilities depend on past usage experience and advertising exposures. We then form likelihood functions for the models and estimate them on Nielsen scanner data for detergent. We find that the functional forms for experience and advertising effects that we derive from the Bayesian learning framework fit the data very well relative to flexible ad hoc functional forms such as exponential smoothing, and also perform better at out-of-sample prediction. Another finding is that in the context of consumer learning of product attributes, although the forward-looking model fits the data statistically better at conventional significance levels, both models produce similar parameter estimates and policy implications. Our estimates indicate that consumers are risk-averse with respect to variation in brand attributes, which discourages them from buying unfamiliar brands. Using the estimated behavioral models, we perform various scenario evaluations to find how changes in marketing strategy affect brand choice both in the short and long run. A key finding obtained from the policy experiments is that advertising intensity has only weak short run effects, but a strong cumulative effect in the long run. The substantive content of the paper is potentially of interest to academics in marketing, economics and decision sciences, as well as product managers, marketing research managers and analysts interested in studying the effectiveness of marketing mix strategies. Our paper will be of particular interest to those interested in the long run effects of advertising. Note that our estimation strategy requires us to specify explicit behavioral models of consumer choice behavior, derive the implied relationships among choice probabilities, past purchases and marketing mix variables, and then estimate the behavioral parameters of each model. Such an estimation strategy is referred to as ""structural"" estimation, and econometric models that are based explicitly on the consumer's maximization problem and whose parameters are parameters of the consumers' utility functions or of their constraints are referred to as ""structural"" models. A key benefit of the structural approach is its potential usefulness for policy evaluation. The parameters of structural models are invariant to policy, that is, they do not change due to a change in the policy. In contrast, the parameters of reduced form brand choice models are, in general, functions of marketing strategy variables (e.g., consumer response to price may depend on pricing policy). As a result, the predictions of reduced form models for the outcomes of policy experiments may be unreliable, because in making the prediction one must assume that the model parameters are unaffected by the policy change. Since the agents in our models choose among many alternative brands, their choice probabilities take the form of higher-order integrals. We employ Monte-Carlo methods to approximate these integrals and estimate our models using simulated maximum likelihood. Estimation of the dynamic forward-looking model also requires that a dynamic programming problem be solved in order to form the likelihood function. For this we use a new approximation method based on simulation and interpolation techniques. These estimation techniques may be of interest to researchers and policy makers in many fields where dynamic choice among discrete alternatives is important, such as marketing, decision sciences, labor and health economics, and industrial organization.","Advertising; Brand choice; Buyer Behavior; Choice Models; Econometric Modelling; Information Processing","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0030305348"

It also aims to reveal and test the close relationship between the trust in a web site and the degree of loyalty to it. Design/methodology/approach First, there is an explanation of the main attributes of the concepts examined, with special attention being paid to the multi-dimensional nature of the variables and the relationships between them. This is followed by an examination of the validation processes of the measuring instruments. Findings Specifically, the study reveals that an individual's loyalty to a web site is closely linked to the levels of trust. Thus, the development of trust not only affects the intention to buy, as shown by previous researchers, but it also directly affects the effective purchasing behavior, in terms of preference, cost and frequency of visits, and therefore, the level of profitability provided by each consumer. In addition, the analyses show that trust in the internet is particularly influenced by the security perceived by consumers regarding the handling of their private data. Practical implications The results of this study provide several managerial implications for companies in this sector. Suggestions are offered for national and international organizations involved in regulating these markets.

Drawing on the helping behavior and boycott literature, the authors take a cost-benefit approach to the decision to boycott and present a conceptualization of motivations for boycott participation. The authors tested their framework during an actual boycott of a multinational firm that was prompted by factory closings. Consumers who viewed the closures as egregious were more likely to boycott the firm, though only a minority did so. Four factors are found to predict boycott participation: the desire to make a difference, the scope for self-enhancement, counterarguments that inhibit boycotting, and the cost to the boycotter of constrained consumption. Furthermore, self-enhancement and constrained consumption are significant moderators of the relationship between the perceived egregiousness of the firm's actions and boycott participation. The authors also explore the role of perceptions of others' participation and discuss implications for marketers, nongovernmental organizations, policymakers, and researchers.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-3142659825"

We study how economic downturns, as measured by various indicators, especially by declining GDP levels, falling consumer confdence, and rising unemployment, were found to affect fertility. We also discuss particular mechanisms through which the recession may have influenced fertility behavior, including the effects of economic uncertainty, falling income, changes in the housing market, and rising enrollment in higher education, and also factors that influence fertility indirectly such as declining marriage rates. Most studies find that fertility tends to be pro-cyclical and often rises and declines with the ups and downs of the business cycle. Usually, these aggregate effects are relatively small (typically, a few percentage points) and of short durations; in addition they often influence especially the timing of childbearing and in most cases do not leave an imprint on cohort fertility levels. Therefore, major long-term fertility shifts often continue seemingly uninterrupted during the recession-including the fertility declines before and during the Great Depression of the 1930s and before and during the oil shock crises of the 1970s. Changes in the opportunity costs of childbearing and fertility behavior during economic downturn vary by sex, age, social status, and number of children; childless young adults are usually most affected. Furthermore, various policies and institutions may modify or even reverse the relationship between recessions and fertility. The first evidence pertaining to the recent recession falls in line with these findings. In most countries, the recession has brought a decline in the number of births and fertility rates, often marking a sharp halt to the previous decade of rising fertility rates. © 2011 The Population Council, Inc.","","Birth Rate; Developed Countries; Economic Recession; Fertility; History, 20th Century; History, 21st Century; Population Dynamics; Public Health; business cycle; childbearing; economic conditions; economic impact; fertility; financial crisis; Gross Domestic Product; higher education; unemployment; birth rate; developed country; economic recession; economics; education; ethnology; fertility; history; legal aspect; population dynamics; public health; review","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-79959513250"

This paper reports on two studies that examine how variations in a website influence online impulse buying. The results reveal some relevant insights about this phenomenon. Specifically, although many participants had the urge to buy impulsively, regardless of website quality, this behavior's likelihood and magnitude was directly influenced by varying the quality of taskrelevant and mood-relevant cues. Task-relevant cues include characteristics, such as navigability, that help in the attainment of the online consumer's shopping goal. Conversely, mood-relevant cues refer to the characteristics, such as visual appeal, that affect the degree to which a user enjoys browsing a website but that do not directly support a particular shopping goal. The implications of the results for both future research and the design of human-computer interfaces are discussed. © 2009 INFORMS.","Electronic commerce; Environmental psychology; Human-computer interface; Impulse buying; Scenario; Website characteristics","Commerce; Electronic commerce; Human computer interaction; Interfaces (computer); User interfaces; Environmental psychology; Human computer interfaces; Impulse buying; Online consumers; Scenario; Task relevant; Visual appeals; Website quality; Websites","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-67649529414"

TAM was originally developed to predict people's technology-adopting behavior at work environments, but this research stemmed from a questioning of its applicability in marketing (i.e., non-work) settings. The differences between the two settings are exhibited by consumers' self-determining selection behavior and their high involvement in the e-service creation and delivery process. This paper first reviews the TAM and the construct of technology readiness, and then proposes and empirically tests an integrated Technology Readiness and Acceptance Model (TRAM) to augment TAM by taking technology readiness construct into the realm of consumers' adoption of innovations. The results indicate that TRAM substantially broadens the applicability and the explanatory power of either of the prior models and may be a better way to gauge technology adoption in situations where adoption is not mandated by organizational objectives.

However, little prior research efforts have been devoted to evaluate whether these two types of reviews have different influences on the behavior of online users. This study shows that consumer-generated ratings about the quality of food, environment and service of restaurants, and the volume of online consumer reviews are positively associated with the online popularity of restaurants; whereas editor reviews have a negative relationship with consumers' intention to visit a restaurant's webpage.

We investigated this behavior when fears of consumer market disruptions started circulating, to capture human behavior in this unique situation. Based on the stimulus-organism-response (S-O-R) framework, we propose a structural model connecting exposure to online information sources (environmental stimuli) to two behavioral responses: unusual purchases and voluntary self-isolation. To test the proposed model, we collected data from 211 Finnish respondents via an online survey, and carried out analysis using PLS-SEM. We found a strong link between self-intention to self-isolate and intention to make unusual purchases, providing empirical evidence that the reported consumer behavior was directly linked to anticipated time spent in self-isolation. The results further revealed exposure to online information sources led to increased information overload and cyberchondria. Information overload was also a strong predictor of cyberchondria. Perceived severity of the situation and cyberchondria had significant impacts on people's intention to make unusual purchases and voluntarily self-isolate.

This research aims to investigate how online consumers develop their initial trust and purchase intentions. The research in conducted in the context of Taiwanese online bookstores. Design/methodology/ approach - The research examines consumers' online initial trust by using four major categories of determinants: perceived technology, perceived risk, company competency, and trust propensity. It also investigates the impacts of both online initial trust and familiarity with online purchasing on purchase intention. The research model is statistically tested using the web sites of four online bookstores in Taiwan. The web site selected by each respondent is unfamiliar. Findings - It is found that perceived usefulness, perceived security, perceived privacy, perceived good reputation, and willingness to customise are the important antecedents to online initial trust. It is also discovered that different levels of trust propensity moderate perceptions toward the web site and online with respect to online initial trust, including perceived usefulness, perceived security, perceived privacy, perceived good reputation, and willingness to customise.

The results of structural equation modeling show that brand communities established on social media have positive effects on customer/product, customer/brand, customer/company and customer/other customers relationships, which in turn have positive effects on brand trust, and trust has positive effects on brand loyalty. We find that brand trust has a fully mediating role in converting the effects of enhanced relationships in brand community to brand loyalty. The implications for marketing practice and future research are discussed. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Brand community; Brand loyalty; Brand trust; Customer centric model; Social media","Consumer behavior; Sales; Social networking (online); Surveys; Brand community; Brand loyalty; Brand trust; Customer-centric; Social media; Economic and social effects","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84870409435"

We find that, given current battery technology and public perceptions, overall stated intent to purchase or lease electric vehicles is low. Interest in plug-in hybrid technology is somewhat greater than interest in all-electric technology. Consumers who express early interest in adopting electric vehicles are typically highly educated, previous owners of conventional hybrids, environmentally sensitive, and concerned about dependence on foreign oil.

This article contributes to an understanding of this 'Ethical Purchasing Gap' through a review of existing literature, and the inductive analysis of focus group discussions. A model is suggested which includes exogenous variables such as moral maturity and age which have been well covered in the literature, together with further impeding factors identified from the focus group discussions. For some consumers, inertia in purchasing behaviour was such that the decision-making process was devoid of ethical considerations. Several consumers manifested their ethical views through post-purchase dissonance and retrospective feelings of guilt. Others displayed a reluctance to consume ethically due to personal constraints, a perceived negative impact on image or quality, or an outright negation of responsibility. Those who expressed a desire to consume ethically often seemed deterred by cynicism, which caused them to question the impact they, as an individual, could achieve. These findings enhance the understanding of ethical consumption decisions and provide a platform for future research in this area. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","attitude-behaviour gap; ethical consumption; Fair Trade","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-79151468719"

During the last four years a number of empirical studies have investigated the role of trust in the specific context of e-commerce, focusing on different aspects of this multi-dimensional construct. However, empirical research in this area is beset by conflicting conceptualizations of the trust construct, inadequate understanding of the relationships between trust, its antecedents and consequents, and the frequent use of trust scales that are neither theoretically derived nor rigorously validated. The major objective of this paper is to provide an integrative review of the empirical literature on trust in e-commerce in order to allow cumulative analysis of results. The interpretation and comparison of different empirical studies on on-line trust first requires conceptual clarification. A set of trust constructs is proposed that reflects both institutional phenomena (system trust) and personal and interpersonal forms of trust (dispositional trust, trusting beliefs, trusting intentions and trust-related behaviours), thus facilitating a multi-level and multi-dimensional analysis of research problems related to trust in e-commerce.","Consumer behaviour; Electronic commerce; Empirical research; On-line shopping; Review; Trust","Electronic commerce; Electronic data interchange; Online systems; Security of data; Virtual reality; World Wide Web; Consumer behavior; Empirical research; Online shopping; Online trust; Human computer interaction","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0038615886"

The chapter surveys theoretical and empirical work on the labor supply of women, with special reference to women in Western economies, primarily the United States, in modern times. The behavior of female labor supply has important implications for many other phenomena, including marriage, fertility, divorce, the distribution of family earnings and male-female wage differentials. The labor supply of women is also of interest, because of the technical questions it poses. For example, because many women do not work, corner solutions are at least potentially a very important issue in both the theoretical and empirical analysis of female labor supply, even though in other contexts (for example, studies of consumer demand) corner solutions are often ignored. The chapter presents some “stylized facts” about female labor supply, and then discusses a number of theoretical models of special interest for understanding female labor supply. After considering empirical studies of the labor supply of women, the chapter concludes with some suggestions for future research. The chapter discusses major trends and cyclical patterns in time-series data, and then examines cross-sectional phenomena. © 1986, Elsevier Science Publishers B.V.

Verbatim texts of 20 phenomenological interviews concerning consumers' perceptions and experiences of fashion are interpreted through a hermeneutic process with specific consideration given to gender issues. Whereas critics of consumer culture frequently argue that fashion discourses enshroud consumer perceptions in a common hegemonic outlook, our analysis suggests that this ideological system offers a myriad of countervailing interpretive standpoints that consumers combine, adapt, and juxtapose to fit the conditions of their everyday lives. By appropriating fashion discourse, consumers generate personalized fashion narratives and metaphoric and metonymic references that negotiate key existential tensions and that often express resistance to dominant fashion norms in their social milieu or consumer culture at large. A theoretical model is derived that portrays a dialogical relationship between consumers and this cultural system of countervailing fashion meanings. The implications of this model for future research on the meaning transfer process and the sociocognitive dimensions of consumer beliefs are discussed.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0031505424"

In most applications of the model, the vector of consumer utility weights on product attributes is assumed to have a multivariate normal (MVN) distribution in the population. Thus, some consumers care more about some attributes than others, and the IIA property of multinomial logit (MNL) is avoided (i.e., segments of consumers will tend to switch among the subset of brands that possess their most valued attributes). The MIXL model is also appealing because it is relatively easy to estimate. Recently, however, some researchers have argued that the MVN is a poor choice for modelling taste heterogeneity. They argue that much of the heterogeneity in attribute weights is accounted for by a pure scale effect (i.e., across consumers, all attribute weights are scaled up or down in tandem). This implies that choice behaviour is simply more random for some consumers than others (i.e., holding attribute coefficients fixed, the scale of their error term is greater). This leads to a scale heterogeneity MNL model (S-MNL). Here, we develop a generalized multinomial logit model (G-MNL) that nests S-MNL and MIXL. By estimating the S-MNL, MIXL, and G-MNL models on 10 data sets, we provide evidence on their relative performance. We find that models that account for scale heterogeneity (i.e., G-MNL or S-MNL) are preferred to MIXL by the Bayes and consistent Akaike information criteria in all 10 data sets. Accounting for scale heterogeneity enables one to account for extreme consumers who exhibit nearly lexicographic preferences, as well as consumers who exhibit very random behaviour (in a sense we formalize below). © 2010 INFORMS.","Choice experiments; Choice models; Consumer heterogeneity; Mixture models","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-77953711920"

In addition, in two additional laboratory studies, they find further evidence for this matching hypothesis, in which a pairing of loss- (gain-) framed messages that activates more concrete (abstract) mind-sets leads to enhanced processing fluency, increased efficacy, and, as a result, more positive recycling intentions. The findings have implications for marketers, consumers, and society as a whole. © 2011, American Marketing Association.","Abstract thinking; Concrete thinking; Construal level; Gain frame; Loss frame; Message framing; Recycling","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-79959355356"

This paper presents new research findings from a mixed-method empirical study of a local organic food network to interrogate the theories of both sustainable consumption and ecological citizenship. It describes a mainstream policy model of sustainable consumption, and contrasts this with an alternative model derived from green or 'new economics' theories. Then the role of localised, organic food networks is discussed to locate them within the alternative model. It then tests the hypothesis that ecological citizenship is a driving force for 'alternative' sustainable consumption, via expression through consumer behaviour such as purchasing local organic food. The empirical study found that both the organisation and their consumers were expressing ecological citizenship values in their activities in a number of clearly identifiable ways, and that the initiative was actively promoting the growth of ecological citizenship, as well as providing a meaningful social context for its expression. Furthermore, the initiative was able to overcome the structural limitations of mainstream sustainable consumption practices. Thus, the initiative was found to be a valuable tool for practising alternative sustainable consumption. The paper concludes with a discussion of how ecological citizenship may be a powerful motivating force for sustainable consumption behaviour, and the policy and research implications of this. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

(2) Sensory search attributes, particularly visual cues about the product (e.g., paper towel design), have lower impact on choices online, and factual information (i.e., non-sensory attributes, such as the fat content of margarine) have higher impact on choices online. (3) Price sensitivity is higher online, but this is due to online promotions being stronger signals of price discounts.

The change in the dynamics of the marketing interchange between companies and consumers as introduced by social networks has placed a focus on the non-transactional customer behavior. In this new marketing era, the terms engagement and participation became the central non-transactional constructs, used to describe the nature of participants’ specific interactions and/or interactive experiences. These changes imposed challenges to the traditional one-way marketing, resulting in companies experimenting with many different approaches, thus shaping a successful social media approach based on the trial-and-error experiences. To provide insights to practitioners willing to utilize social networks for marketing purposes, our study analyzes the influencing factors in terms of characteristics of the content communicated by the company, such as media type, content type, posting day and time, over the level of online customer engagement measured by number of likes, comments and shares, and interaction duration for the domain of a Facebook brand page.

Here the urgent societal issue is not to celebrate freedom from social constraints, but to re‐establish communal embeddedness. The citizen of 2002 is less interested in the objects of consumption than in the social links and identities that come with them. This Latin view holds that people like to gather together in tribes and that such social, proximate communities are more affective and influential on people’s behaviour than either marketing institutions or other “formal” cultural authorities. There is also an element of resistance and re‐appropriation in the acts of being, gathering and experiencing together. This view of the shared experience of tribes sets it apart from both Northern notions of segmented markets and one‐to‐one relationships. In this Latin view, the effective marketing of 2002 and beyond is not to accept and exploit consumers in their contemporary individualisation, as Northern approaches might. Rather the future of marketing is in offering and supporting a renewed sense of community. Marketing becomes tribal marketing. In a marketing profession challenged by the Internet phenomenon, tribal marketing is by no means just another passing fad but a Trojan horse to induce companies to take on board the re‐emergence of the quest for community. © 2002, MCB UP Limited.","Behavioural sciences; Consumer behaviour; Marketing; Postmodernism; Society","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85036279889"

Making choices led to reduced self-control (i.e., less physical stamina, reduced persistence in the face of failure, more procrastination, and less quality and quantity of arithmetic calculations). A field study then found that reduced self-control was predicted by shoppers' self-reported degree of previous active decision making.

Design/methodology/approach - The paper uses structural equation modeling to test the significance of the overall model and the specified paths. Findings - It is found that current purchases are affected by brand image mostly directly and by brand awareness mostly indirectly. In contrast, future purchases are not affected by either dimension of brand knowledge directly; rather, brand knowledge affects future purchases via a brand relationship path that includes brand satisfaction, brand trust, and attachment to the brand. Thus, brand knowledge alone is not sufficient for building strong brands in the long term; brand relationship factors must be considered as well. Research implications/limitations - The present study did not examine feedback effects and included consumer categories only and no individualdifferences variables. It is recommended that future research examine feedback effects and include additional consumer categories, B2B categories and individual-differences variables such as variety seeking and innovativeness. Practical implications - Brand managers spend considerable resources on measuring brand awareness and brand image. It is recommended that practitioners also use brand relationship measures and develop strategic and tactical initiatives that ensure that consumers are satisfied with the brand, trust it and feel attached to it. Originality/value - The paper is a cross-paradigm paper: it is the first that combines the two separate broad-based perspectives on brands into a simple comprehensive model for researchers and brand managers. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Brand awareness; Brand equity; Brand management; Consumer behaviour","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-33646856585"

First, we compare the economic and psychological approach towards this topic, followed by a conceptual framework of EV preferences which is then implemented to organise our review. We also briefly review the modelling techniques applied in the selected studies. Estimates of consumer preferences for financial, technical, infrastructure and policy attributes are then reviewed. A categorisation of influential factors for consumer preferences into groups such as socio-economic variables, psychological factors, mobility condition, social influence, etc. is then made and their effects are elaborated.

This paper explores this question by investigating how the presence of retail activities in neighborhoods influences the commuting choices of residents using data from the 1985 American Housing Survey. Having grocery stores and other consumer services within 300 feet of one's residence is found to encourage commuting by mass transit, walking and bicycling, controlling for such factors as residential densities and vehicle ownership levels. When retail shops are beyond 300 feet yet within 1 mile of residences, however, they tend to encourage auto-commuting, ostensibly because of the ability to efficiently link work and shop trips by car. The presence of nearby commercial land-uses is also associated with relatively low vehicle ownership rates and short commuting distances among residents of a mixed-use neighborhood. Overall, residential densities exerted a stronger influence on commuting mode choices than levels of land-use mixture, except for walking and bicycle commutes. For non-motorized commuting, the presence or absence of neighborhood shops is a better predictor of mode choice than residential densities.

By comparing consumers from both Malaysia and China, this research is able to form a prediction model based on two different cultural settings. Data was collected from 172 Malaysian consumers and 222 Chinese consumers, and hierarchical regression analysis was employed to test the research model. The results showed that age, trust, cost, social influence, and variety of services are able to predict Malaysian consumer decisions to adopt m-commerce. Trust, cost, and social influence can be used to predict Chinese consumer decisions to adopt m-commerce. This research confirms the need to extend the traditional TAM and DOI models when studying technology such as m-commerce.

This article explores consumer health information seeking in the realm of the primary sources of health information used by consumers. Based on an analysis of the 1999 HealthStyles data, the paper demonstrates that active communication channels such as interpersonal communication, print readership, and Internet communication serve as primary health information sources for health-conscious, health-information oriented individuals with strong health beliefs, and commitment to healthy activities. On the other hand, passive consumption channels such as television and radio serve as primary health information resources for individuals who are not health-oriented. Media planning implications are drawn from the results, suggesting that broadcast outlets with an entertainment orientation are better suited for prevention campaigns. Such channels provide suitable sites for entertainment-education. On the other hand, print media, interpersonal networks, and the Internet are better suited for communicating about health issues to the health-active consumer segment.","","adult; article; attitude; cognition; comparative study; education; health behavior; health care; human; Internet; interpersonal communication; medical information","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-4544233371"

Design/methodology/approach - A total of 6,010 (2,975 males and 3,035 females) adolescents in Hong Kong were recruited through multi-staged random sampling. Surveys were distributed through 48 high schools in Hong Kong. Findings - Female adolescents scored significantly higher in environmental attitude, environmental concern, perceived seriousness of environmental problems, perceived environmental responsibility, peer influence and green purchasing behavior than male adolescents in Hong Kong. In contrast, male adolescents' average score on self-identity in environmental protection was significantly higher than that of the female adolescents. Research limitations/implications - A major limitation lies in the self-reported nature of survey used in the study. Future study should include some objective assessments (such as observations or other-reported survey) of the subjects' green purchasing and environmental behaviors. Practical implications - This study should provide a useful source of information for international green marketers in Hong Kong. Hong Kong female adolescents constitute a potentially good market for green products. Marketing messages targeting this group should use emotional appeals, emphasize individual responsibility to protect the environment, and facilitate peer networking to spread good word-of-mouth.

As food production systems and consumption patterns are among the leading drivers of impacts on the environment, it is important to assess and improve food-related supply chains as much as possible. Over the years, life cycle assessment has been used extensively to assess agricultural systems and food processing and manufacturing activities, and compare alternatives “from field to fork” and through to food waste management. Notwithstanding the efforts, several methodological aspects of life cycle assessment still need further improvement in order to ensure adequate and robust support for decision making in both business and policy development contexts. This paper discusses the challenges for life cycle assessment arising from the complexity of food systems, and recommends research priorities for both scientific development and improvements in practical implementation. In summary, the intrinsic variability of food production systems requires dedicated modelling approaches, including addressing issues related to: the distinction between technosphere and ecosphere; the most appropriate functional unit; the multi-functionality of biological systems; and the modelling of the emissions and how this links with life cycle impact assessment. Also, data availability and interpretation of the results are two issues requiring further attention, including how to account for consumer behaviour. © 2016 The Authors","Agri-food products; Food LCA; Food supply chains; Food waste; Sustainable production and consumption","Biological systems; Decision making; Food processing; Food products; Food supply; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Waste management; Food production systems; Food waste; Intrinsic variabilities; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life cycle impact assessment; Manufacturing activities; Scientific development; Sustainable production; Life cycle","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84993952377"

Life's mundane tasks and the consumer behaviors necessary to enact them are cast in a perspective of self little used by consumer psychologists—social—identity theory. Two structural modeling studies in support of the perspective are reported. The results of the first one imply that people use products to enact one of their social identities and that products relate only indirectly to the overall or global self. The second study indicates that the frequency with which activities are performed depends on the salience of the identity they represent and that such salience, in turn, depends on several enabling factors. Taken together, the studies provide theoretical support for the common-sense notion that we are attracted to products that are consistent with, and that enable the enactment of, the various social identities which make up our sense of self; the more important an identity to us, the more attractive its associated products. © 1993, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc..

Whereas prior research attributes this gender gap in sustainable consumption to personality differences between the sexes, we propose that it may also partially stem from a prevalent association between green behavior and femininity, and a corresponding stereotype (held by both men and women) that green consumers are more feminine. Building on prior findings that men tend to be more concerned than women with gender-identity maintenance, we argue that this green-feminine stereotype may motivate men to avoid green behaviors in order to preserve a macho image. A series of seven studies provides evidence that the concepts of greenness and femininity are cognitively linked and shows that, accordingly, consumers who engage in green behaviors are stereotyped by others as more feminine and even perceive themselves as more feminine. Further, men's willingness to engage in green behaviors can be influenced by threatening or affirming their masculinity, as well as by using masculine rather than conventional green branding. Together, these findings bridge literatures on identity and environmental sustainability and introduce the notion that due to the green-feminine stereotype, gender identity maintenance can influence men's likelihood of adopting green behaviors. © 2016.

Using structural equation modeling, this study investigates the linkages of customer engagement with traditional antecedents of brand loyalty. Results based on 496 hotel and airline customers suggest that customer engagement enhances customers’ service brand evaluation, brand trust, and brand loyalty.

This review article examines what we argue are the key concepts, external influences and opportune research contexts in contemporary tourism CB research. Using a narrative review, we examine the CB literature published in three major tourism journals from 2000 to 2012. Of 519 articles identified and reviewed, 191 are included in this article. We examine the development of and scope for future research on nine key concepts, including decision-making, values, motivations, self-concept and personality, expectations, attitudes, perceptions, satisfaction, trust and loyalty. We then examine three important external influences on tourism behaviour, technology, Generation Y and the rise in concern over ethical consumption. Finally, we identify and discuss five research contexts that represent major areas for future scholarship: group and joint decision-making, under-researched segments, cross-cultural issues in emerging markets, emotions and consumer misbehaviour.

It focuses on literature relating to consumer preferences for charging infrastructure, and how consumers interact with and use this infrastructure. This includes studies that use questionnaire surveys, interviews, modelling, GPS data from vehicles, and data from electric vehicle charging equipment. These studies indicate that the most important location for PEV charging is at home, followed by work, and then public locations. Studies have found that more effort is needed to ensure consumers have easy access to PEV charging and that charging at home, work, or public locations should not be free of cost. Research indicates that PEV charging will not impact electricity grids on the short term, however charging may need to be managed when the vehicles are deployed in greater numbers. In some areas of study the literature is not sufficiently mature to draw any conclusions from. More research is especially needed to determine how much infrastructure is needed to support the roll out of PEVs. This paper ends with policy implications and suggests avenues of future research. © 2018","","Charging (batteries); Plug-in electric vehicles; Public policy; Surveys; Charging infrastructures; Consumers' preferences; Electric vehicle charging; Electric vehicle charging infrastructures; GPS data; It focus; Literature reviews; Market introduction; Plug-in electric vehicle charging; Questionnaires/surveys/interviews; consumption behavior; electric vehicle; literature review; preference behavior; transportation infrastructure; Location","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85045116727"

Structural equation modeling indicated that parents, work, and high school financial education during adolescence predicted young adults' current financial learning, attitude and behavior, with the role played by parents substantially greater than the role played by work experience and high school financial education combined. Data also supported the proposed hierarchical financial socialization four-level model, indicating that early financial socialization is related to financial learning, which in turn is related to financial attitudes and subsequently to financial behavior.

However, despite significant practitioner interest, academic DCM research is lagging, resulting in an important knowledge gap. Based on an extensive review, we conceptualize DCM as the creation and dissemination of relevant, valuable brand-related content to current or prospective customers on digital platforms to develop their favorable brand engagement, trust, and relationships (vs. directly persuading consumers to purchase). We also develop a conceptual framework that identifies important consumer-based DCM antecedents, including uses-and-gratifications (U&G)-informed functional, hedonic, and authenticity-based motives for DCM interactions. DCM's first-tier, intra-interaction consequences include consumers’ cognitive, emotional, and behavioral engagement that foster brand-related sense-making, identification, and citizenship behaviors, respectively. These in turn trigger DCM's second-tier, extra-interaction consequences of brand trust and attitude, which successively contribute to the development of DCM's third-tier, value-based consequences of consumer and firm-based brand equity. We summarize our findings in a set of Fundamental Propositions (FPs) of DCM and conclude by deriving key implications from our analyses. © 2018","Brand equity; Conceptual framework; Digital content marketing; Engagement; Trust","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85058523915"

The study employs multiple qualitative methods across multiple sites, explores the intention-behavior gap in observed modes of shopping behavior, and uses an interpretive approach. The analysis reveals four interrelated factors affecting the ethical intention-behavior gap: (1) prioritization of ethical concerns; (2) formation of plans/habits; (3) willingness to commit and sacrifice; and (4) modes of shopping behavior. Awareness of these four factors provides both strategic and tactical implications for marketing managers seeking to reach the elusive ethical consumer.

The customer's logic is examined in-depth as being the foundation of a customer-dominant (CD) marketing and business logic. Design/methodology/approach: The authors argue that both the goods- and service-dominant logic are provider-dominant. Contrasting the provider-dominant logic with CD logic, the paper examines the creation of service value from the perspectives of value-in-use, the customer's own context, and the customer's experience of service. Findings: Moving from a provider-dominant logic to a CD logic uncovered five major challenges to service marketers: company involvement, company control in co-creation, visibility of value creation, scope of customer experience, and character of customer experience. Research limitations/implications: The paper is exploratory. It presents and discusses a new perspective and suggests implications for research and practice. Practical implications: Awareness of the mechanisms of customer logic will provide businesses with new perspectives on the role of the company in their customers' lives. It is proposed that understanding the customer's logic should represent the starting-point for the company's marketing and business logic. Originality/value: The paper increases the understanding of how the customer's logic underpins the CD business logic. By exploring consequences of applying a CD logic, further directions for theoretical and empirical research are suggested. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Consumer behaviour; Customer relations; Customers; Logic; Services","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-77956092056"

Presents focus group results on consumer perceptions, attitudes and behaviour in relation to two key interrelated food trends: organic food and animal welfare. The results indicate that consumers often confuse organic and free-range products because they believe that “organic” is equivalent to “free-range” food. Focus group discussions were conducted to identify the main beliefs and attitudes towards organic food of both organic and non-organic food buyers. Results indicate that, although health and food safety concerns are the main motives for organic food purchases, ethical concerns, specifically in relation to standards of animal welfare, play a significant influencing role in the decision to purchase organic food. The results are consistent with parallel research into consumer concerns about animal welfare, which showed that consumers are primarily concerned about food safety issues. Furthermore, the research illustrates the central outcome that animal welfare is used by consumers as an indicator of other, more important product attributes, such as safety and the impact on health. Indeed, ethical considerations seem to motivate the purchase of organic food and free-range products and, therefore, may be viewed as interrelated. However, such ethical frameworks are closely related, if not contingent upon, the quality of the product, which includes perceptions of higher standards of safety and healthiness. Based on the qualitative data, suggests that the organic market could take advantage of research on consumer motivation to buy free-range products, by embodying ethical concerns as an indicator of product quality. © 2002, MCB UP Limited","Consumer behaviour; Farming; Green issues; Organic food","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84986156146"

Fast fashion helps sate deeply held desires among young consumers in the industrialized world for luxury fashion, even as it embodies unsustainability. Trends run their course with lightning speed, with today's latest styles swiftly trumping yesterday's, which have already been consigned to the trash bin. This article addresses the inherent dissonance among fast fashion consumers, who often share a concern for environmental issues even as they indulge in consumer patterns antithetical to ecological best practices. Seemingly adept at compartmentalism, and free of conflicted guilt, such consumers see no contradiction in their Janus-faced desires. Can luxury fashion, with ostensibly an emphasis on authenticity, and its concomitant respect for artisans and the environment, foster values of both quality and sustainability? Since individual identity continually evolves, and requires a materially referential re-imagining of self to do so, we hypothesize that actual rather than faux luxury brands can, ironically, unite the ideals of fashion with those of environmental sustainability. © 2012 Berg.","Fast fashion; Luxury brands; Quality and consumer behavior; Sustainability","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84866302628"

Design/methodology/approach - An online survey for users of a mobile location-based directory service ""Where is the nearest?"" Findings - The behavioral intentions were most influenced by conditional value; the context, in which the service is used, followed closely by commitment and to some extent monetary value. Commitment can be enhanced through building emotional value and conditional value by focusing on offering fun service experiences in the right context. The influence of social and epistemic value was not significant. Research limitations/implications - Further research is encouraged on the relative importance of the value dimensions' influence on loyalty in global markets. Practical implications - The minor influence of monetary value as well as the high influence of conditional value implies that the one-dimensional value measures are not applicable in a mobile context where decisions are often made spontaneously and based on situational needs. Effective marketing strategies need to take into account the contextual use and emphasize either convenience or emotional value.

Given the fact that trust is viewed as the corner-stone, as well as one of the most desirable qualities in any relationship, the objective of this study is to analyze the importance of brand trust in the development of brand equity. Specifically, the paper examines the relationships network in which brand trust is embedded. Design/methodology/approach - A quantitative methodology was adopted. The data are based on a survey conducted in a region in the south-eastern part of Spain, resulting in 271 surveys. Findings - The findings reveal that brand trust is rooted in the result of past experience with the brand, and it is also positively associated with brand loyalty, which in turn maintains a positive relationship with brand equity. Furthermore, the results suggest that, although brand trust does not play a full mediating role as suggested by Morgan and Hunt, it contributes to a better explanation of brand equity. Originality/value - These results have significant implications. The fact that brand equity is best explained when brand trust is taken into account reinforces the idea that brand equity is a relational market-based asset.

In the model, there is a monopolist who sells a finite inventory over a finite time horizon. The seller adjusts prices dynamically to maximize revenue. Customers arrive continually over the duration of the selling season. At each point in time, customers may purchase the product at current prices, remain in the market at a cost to purchase later, or exit, and they wish to maximize individual utility. The customer population is heterogeneous along two dimensions: they may have different valuations for the product and different degrees of patience (waiting costs). We demonstrate that heterogeneity in both valuation and patience is important because they jointly determine the structure of optimal pricing policies. In particular, when high-value customers are proportionately less patient, markdown pricing policies are effective because the high-value customers would buy early at high prices while the low-value customers are willing to wait (i.e., they are not lost). On the other hand, when the high-value customers are more patient than the low-value customers, prices should increase over time to discourage inefficient waiting. Contrary to intuition, we find that strategic waiting by customers may sometimes benefit the seller: when low-value customers wait, they compete for availability with high-value customers and thus increase their willingness to pay. Our results also shed light on how the composition of the customer population affects optimal revenue, consumer surplus, and social welfare. Finally, we consider the long-run problem of selecting the optimal initial stocking quantity. © 2007 INFORMS.","Dynamic pricing; Heterogeneity; Intertemporal substitution; Rationing; Strategic customer behavior","Availability; Cost effectiveness; Optimization; Product development; Public policy; Strategic planning; Dynamic pricing; Heterogeneity; Intertemporal substitution; Rationing; Strategic customer behavior; Customer satisfaction","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-38549155080"

Unlike previous research, our model identifies not only what factors affect consumers' search behavior but also how these factors interact with each other. In particular, the model emphasizes the effect of prior brand perceptions on the search process. We argue that when consumers have brand-specific prior distributions of utility, the existence of relative uncertainty among brands is necessary for search to be useful. Thus, we explain why product class involvement or low search costs may not be sufficient to induce large amounts of search activity and why there may be an inverted-U-shaped relationship between search activity and experience. We test our theory on consumers' search behavior for new automobiles, using data collected contemporaneously with consumers' actual decision process. Our data support our theory.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0031504888"

In some markets, cash is already being replaced by digital transactions, but consumers of many developing countries are slower in transition towards digital payments. This study aims to identify major determinants of consumer mobile payment adoption in India the country with second largest mobile subscribers in the world. Existing mobile payments adoption studies have predominantly utilised Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), which was primarily developed in organisational context and criticised for having deterministic approach without much consideration for users’ individual characteristics. Therefore, this study adapted meta-UTAUT model with individual difference variable attitude as core construct and extended the model with consumer related constructs such as personal innovativeness, anxiety, trust, and grievance redressal. Empirical examination of the model among 491 Indian consumers revealed performance expectancy, intention to use, and grievance redressal as significant positive predictor of consumer use behaviour towards mobile payment. Moreover, intention to use was significantly influenced by attitude, social influence, and facilitating conditions. The major contribution of this study includes re-affirming the central role of attitude in consumer adoption studies and examining usage behaviour in contrast to most existing studies, which examine only behavioural intention. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Adoption; Meta-UTAUT; Mobile payment; TAM; Use behaviour","Developing countries; Global system for mobile communications; Behavioural intentions; Deterministic approach; Empirical examination; Facilitating conditions; Individual characteristics; Individual Differences; Personal innovativeness; Technology acceptance model; Electronic money","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85084585540"

While traditional means of Internet use for travel planning appears to be widespread across all customer segments, higher-order Internet uses (i.e., social media) are now prevalent among some segments, particularly among travelers of Generation Y. Also, there seems to be an important bifurcation in the traveler population in that the traditional online consumers remain unchanged with their pattern of use of online tools while sizable groups are adopting emergent information sources and transaction channels.

Large-scale projects like the Efficient Consumer Response (ECR) in the fast moving consumer goods sector, for example, or Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI) and Collaborative Planning, Forecasting and Replenishment (CPFR) initiatives more generally provide a rich continuum of strategies for collaborating amongst supply chain partners. While individual successful implementations of the latter have already been reported, there has not yet been the widespread adoption that was originally hoped for. In our research, we looked at implementations across several industries and countries, and our findings show that the slow progress to date may be due to a lack of common understanding of these concepts, and the difficulty of integrating external collaboration with internal production and inventory control. In this paper, we set out to classify collaboration initiatives using a conceptual water-tank analogy, and discuss their dynamic behavior and key characteristics. We draw upon case studies from both successful and less successful implementations to illustrate what companies need to do to fully benefit from their collaborative efforts, given their particular circumstances. We conclude that the effectiveness of supply chain collaboration relies upon two factors: the level to which it integrates internal and external operations, and the level to which the efforts are aligned to the supply chain settings in terms of the geographical dispersion, the demand pattern, and the product characteristics. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Design/methodology/approach – The German market research institute GfK provided data (n = 12,113) from their 2012 household panel survey. A two-step structural equation modeling approach was applied to test both the measurement and the structural model. Findings – Willingness to pay (WTP) was the strongest predictor of green purchasing behavior, followed by personal norms. The impact of attitude is insignificant. This implies an attitude – behavior gap. Research limitations/implications – Individuals overestimate their self-reported WTP and behavior, which suggests that the share of explained variance is in reality lower. It has to be doubted whether consumers are objectively able to judge products by their environmental impact. Even if consumers are willing to buy a “greener” product, their subjective evaluation might be incorrect. Further research should be based on actual purchasing data. In addition, the attitude – behavior gap should be scrutinized by further research to identify further barriers to green consumption. Practical implications – Consumers need to be aware that their consumption behavior can make a difference. They have to value the benefits of green products and understand why these are priced higher. Firms can apply pricing and promotional strategies addressing personal norms and inducing a higher WTP to capitalize on the opportunities of the green market segment. Originality/value – The study integrates WTP and personal norms as critical predictors into the TPB and furthermore expands the extant literature on green purchasing behavior to cover daily consumer goods extending beyond organic food. This enhances understanding of the structure of the constructs and determines their relative importance. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Attitude; Green; Organic; Price; Sustainability; Willingness to pay","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84946182720"

Drawing on social identity theory, a model of influence of CSR on loyalty is developed and tested using a sample of real consumers. Results demonstrate that CSR initiatives are linked to stronger loyalty both because the consumer develops a more positive company evaluation, and because one identifies more strongly with the company. Moreover, identity salience is shown to play a crucial role in the influence of CSR initiatives on consumer loyalty when this influence occurs through consumer-company identification. A strong identifier is not necessarily in a constant state of salience, but activating identity salience of a particular consumer social identity (a company) will affect consumer reactions to product stimuli, increasing consumer loyalty. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Consumer behavior; Corporate social responsibility; Identification; Identity attractiveness; Relationship marketing","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-57349177031"

We develop a model of such a system and compare its performance to three alternative systems: Quick-response-only systems, enhanced-design-only systems, and traditional systems (which lack both enhanced design and quick response capabilities). In particular, we focus on the impact of each of the four systems on ""strategic"" or forward-looking consumer purchasing behavior, i.e., the intentional delay in purchasing an item at the full price to obtain it during an end-of-season clearance. We find that enhanced design helps to mitigate strategic behavior by offering consumers a product they value more, making them less willing to risk waiting for a clearance sale and possibly experiencing a stockout. Quick response mitigates strategic behavior through a different mechanism: by better matching supply to demand, it reduces the chance of a clearance sale. Most importantly, we find that although it is possible for quick response and enhanced design to be either complements or substitutes, the complementarity effect tends to dominate. Hence, when both quick response and enhanced design are combined in a fast fashion system, the firm typically enjoys a greater incremental increase in profit than the sum of the increases resulting from employing either system in isolation. Furthermore, complementarity is strongest when customers are very strategic. We conclude that fast fashion systems can be of significant value, particularly when consumers exhibit strategic behavior. © 2011 INFORMS.","Fast fashion; Game theory; Quick response; Strategic behavior","Game theory; Profitability; Sales; Alternative systems; Consumer behaviors; Consumer trends; Design capability; Different mechanisms; Fast fashion; Lead time; Production capabilities; Quick response; Stock-out; Strategic Behavior; Traditional systems; Uncertain demand; Product design","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-79954462534"

Design/methodology/approach: Published literature, personal research experience, insights from virtual open forums and practitioner interviews inform this study. Findings: COVID-19 pandemic events and responses are unprecedented to modern operations and supply chains. Scholars and practitioners seek to make sense of how this event will make us revisit basic scholarly notions and ontology. Sustainability implications exist. Short-term environmental sustainability gains occur, while long-term effects are still uncertain and require research. Sustainability and resilience are complements and jointly require investigation. Research limitations/implications: The COVID-19 crisis is emerging and evolving. It is not clear whether short-term changes and responses will result in a new “normal.” Adjustment to current theories or new theoretical developments may be necessary. This pathway article only starts the conservation – many additional sustainability issues do arise and cannot be covered in one essay. Practical implications: Organizations have faced a major shock during this crisis. Environmental sustainability practices can help organizations manage in this and future competitive contexts. Social implications: Broad economic, operational, social and ecological-environmental sustainability implications are included – although the focus is on environmental sustainability. Emergent organizational, consumer, policy and supply chain behaviors are identified. Originality/value: The authors take an operations and supply chain environmental sustainability perspective to COVID-19 pandemic implications; with sustainable representing the triple bottom-line dimensions of environmental, social and economic sustainability; with a special focus on environmental sustainability. Substantial open questions for investigation are identified.

Unfortunately, many currently available techniques for eliciting individuals' values suffer from a serious problem in that they involve asking individuals hypothetical questions about intended behavior. Experimental auctions circumvent this problem because they involve individuals exchanging real money for real goods in an active market. This represents a promising means for eliciting non-market values. Lusk and Shogren provide a comprehensive guide to the theory and practice of experimental auctions.

Consequently, this study of service encounters and restaurant consumer behavior constructed a comprehensive framework via a literature review. Empirical data were collected by a questionnaire distributed to luxury-hotel restaurant customers. The empirical results indicated that restaurant environmental factors and interactions with service employees and other consumers positively influence the consumer experiential value. Additionally, only interactive relationships with service employees directly and positively affect consumer satisfaction. Restaurant environment factors and interactions with other consumers indirectly and positively influence consumer satisfaction through experiential value. Finally, with respect to marketing and development initiatives, the results of this study can help improve the physical attractiveness of the examined luxury-hotel restaurants.

Existing market research techniques for measuring WTP differ in whether they provide an incentive to consumers to reveal their true WTP and in whether they simulate actual point-of-purchase contexts. The authors present an-empirical comparison of several procedures for eliciting WTP that are applicable directly at the point of purchase. In particular, the authors test the applicability of Becker, DeGroot, and Marschak's (1964) well-known incentive-compatible procedure for assessing the utility of lotteries to measuring consumers' WTP. In three studies, the authors explore the reliability, validity, and feasibility of the procedure and show that it yields lower WTP estimates than do non-incentive-compatible methods such as open-ended and double-bounded contingent valuation. They show experimentally that differences in WTP estimates arise from the incentive constraint rather than the cognitive effort required in responding. They also control for strategic response behavior.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0035995557"

Our results indicate that recovery outcomes (e.g. compensation), procedures (eg. speed of recovery) and interactional treatment (e.g. apology) have a joint effect on post-recovery satisfaction. Specifically, our findings suggest that compensation may not enhance satisfaction when the recovery process is well-executed (an immediate response combined with an apology). Similarly, compensation failed to lessen dissatisfaction with a poor recovery process (a delayed response without apology). It thus seems that compensation is a poor substitute for a good recovery process. However, offering compensation was effective in increasing satisfaction in mixed-bag recovery situations (delayed recovery with an apology, or immediate recovery without apology). Furthermore, we found that service recovery satisfaction acted as a full mediator between service recovery attributes (compensation, recovery speed and apology) and behavioral intentions (repurchase intent and negative WOM). Finally, our findings suggest that consumer attributions for stability and controllability for the failure vary across recovery efforts.

We derived and examined the model through structural equation modeling in a sample of 483 respondents in Thailand. The findings of this model indicated that consumer attitude, subjective norm and perceived behavioral control have significant positive influences on the purchase intention for green products. Furthermore, our results indicated that environmental concerns have a significant effect on attitude, perceived behavioral control and purchase intention for green products, but subjective norm. Moreover, environmental knowledge had no significant effect on the purchase intention for green products. Instead, it had a distinct indirect effect through attitude towards purchasing green products, subjective norm and perceived behavioral control.

The paper begins with an analysis of the classical branding literature and a review of the emerging literature associated with the relational exchange and the network marketing paradigms. Four streams of thought are identified as regards the nature of brands. These include the brand as a communicator, the brand as a perceptual entity or image, the brand as a value enhancer and the brand as a relationship. A review of the place marketing literature suggests that the focus to date has been on brands as perceptual entities or images. The paper argues that such conceptualisations seriously limit the development of place brands in general and destination brands in particular. A model of the place brand is presented based upon the concept of a brand as a relationship with consumers and other stakeholders, focusing on behaviours rather than communications and reality rather than image. The practical implications of this approach are discussed. © Henry Stewart Publications, 1356-7667.","brand reality; marketing networks; place brands; relational exchange; services marketing","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-18144365577"

Then, six important consumer behaviors are modeled as 'effects' and are shown to be explained by various forms and sources of involvement: extensiveness of decision making, interest in advertising, social observations, shopping enjoyment, brand commitment, and product usage.

A growing body of research suggests that consumers have relationships with brands that resemble relations between people. We propose that consumers perceive brands in the same way they perceive people. This approach allows us to explore how social perception theories and processes can predict brand purchase interest and loyalty. Brands as Intentional Agents Framework is based on a well-established social perception approach: the Stereotype Content Model. Two studies support the Brands as Intentional Agents Framework prediction that consumers assess a brand's perceived intentions and ability and that these perceptions elicit distinct emotions and drive differential brand behaviors. The research shows that human social interaction relationships translate to consumer-brand interactions in ways that are useful to inform brand positioning and brand communications. © 2012 Society for Consumer Psychology.","Ability; Agents; Brands; Consumers; Intent; Stereotypes","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84860838591"

First, we propose a new definition based on a perceptual perspective of financial well-being and link it to an individual's current and anticipated desired living standard and financial freedom. We then develop a framework that distinguishes key elements of financial well-being; namely, interventions and financial behaviors, consequences, contextual factors, and personal factors. We then present a research agenda to guide future research on financial well-being.

To resolve that problem, we propose a simple but inclusive definition of identity. Identity can be defined as any category label with which a consumer self-associates that is amenable to a clear picture of what a person in that category looks like, thinks, feels and does. Building from this definition, we propose the following five basic principles that can help researchers model the process of identity formation and expression: (1) Identity Salience: identity processing increases when the identity is an active component of the self; (2) Identity Association: the non-conscious association of stimuli with a positive and salient identity improves a person's response to the stimuli; (3) Identity Relevance: the deliberative evaluation of identity-linked stimuli depends on how diagnostic the identity is in the relevant domain; (4) Identity Verification: individuals monitor their own behaviors to manage and reinforce their identities; and (5) Identity Conflict: identity-linked behaviors help consumers manage the relative prominence of multiple identities. To illustrate the potential usefulness of these principles for guiding identity research, we discuss new avenues for identity research and explain how these principles could help guide investigations into these areas. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Consumer behavior; Identity","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84870302413"

Aggregate results indicated that respondents were most strongly attracted to Airbnb by its practical attributes, and somewhat less so by its experiential attributes. An exploratory factor analysis identified five motivating factors—Interaction, Home Benefits, Novelty, Sharing Economy Ethos, and Local Authenticity. A subsequent cluster analysis divided the respondents into five segments—Money Savers, Home Seekers, Collaborative Consumers, Pragmatic Novelty Seekers, and Interactive Novelty Seekers.

Factors driving service innovation resistance remain unclear. To better understand this behavior, the present study examines how five theory-driven adoption barriers-usage, value, risk, tradition, and image - as well as three consumer demographics-gender, age, and income-influence consumer adoption versus rejection decisions in Internet and mobile banking. Data from two large nationwide surveys conducted in Finland (n = 1736 consumers) test hypotheses using binary logit models comparing mobile banking adopters versus non-adopters, mobile banking postponers versus rejecters, and Internet banking postponers versus rejecters. Study results find that the value barrier is the strongest inhibitor of Internet and mobile banking adoption. In addition, the image barrier slows mobile banking adoption, and the tradition barrier explains the rejection of Internet banking. Gender and age significantly predict adoption and rejection decisions. The results demonstrate notable differences between these seemingly similar service innovations. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Adoption; Consumer resistance; Internet banking; Logistic regression; Mobile banking; Rejection; Service innovation","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84960839652"

In this study, we conduct a systematic review of social commerce studies to explicate how consumers behave on social networking sites. We classify these studies, discuss noteworthy theories, and identify important research methods. More importantly, we draw upon the stimulus-organism-response model and the five-stage consumer decision-making process to propose an integrative framework for understanding consumer behavior in this context.

Information technology enables new forms of producer-consumer collaboration in new product development processes. However, little research exists on consumers' experiences during virtual co-creation tasks. Drawing on the literature on organizational behavior, we introduce the construct of consumer empowerment to describe consumers' perceived influence on product design and decision making. This paper presents the first large-scale empirical study investigating how consumers are empowered through Internet-based co-creation activities. To analyze the impact of applied interaction tools, 727 consumers having taken part in virtual co-creation projects were asked about their experienced tool support, their perceived empowerment, how much they enjoyed the task, and their readiness to participate in future co-creation opportunities. The results show that consumers engaging in co-creation feel more or less empowered. The level of experienced empowerment depends on the design of the applied virtual interaction tool, the related enjoyment of the virtual interaction, the participants' task and product involvement, as well as their creativity and lead-user characteristics. The design of the interaction tool determines to what extent consumers with varying capabilities are able to solve the assigned co-creation task. It determines the consumers' perceived empowerment and experienced enjoyment. Both the levels of perceived empowerment and enjoyment have a strong impact on the consumers' willingness to participate in future virtual new product development projects. These findings contribute to a better understanding of antecedents and consequences of successful consumer co-creation. They provide recommendations on how to design a compelling virtual new product co-creation experience. © 2010 M.E.

Tourists have the largest adaptive capacity of elements within the tourism system because of their flexibility to substitute the place, timing and type of holiday, even at very short notice. Consequently, understanding tourist perceptions and reactions to the impacts of climate change is essential to anticipating the potential geographic and seasonal shifts in tourism demand, as well as the decline or increase of specific tourism markets. Yet, despite a wide range of publications assessing reactions of tourists to various environmental and climate-related changes, little is actually known about the complexity of demand responses.

Design/methodology/approach – Data are collected through self-administered questionnaires. This paper uses multiple regression analysis to identify the factors affecting halal food purchasing behavior of Malaysian consumers. Findings – The multiple regression analysis results indicate that all factors have positive and significant influence on halal food purchasing intention. Research limitations/implications – Like other empirical studies, this study is not without its limitations. The sample size itself is relatively small. The study can be strengthened by increasing the sample size and including participants in other geographical areas. This study also considered only three antecedents of halal food purchasing among consumers in Malaysia. As Malaysia is actually trying to play for a bigger role in the halal industry, more research is needed to identify and address problematic aspects of consumption of halal food. Potential correlations between some of the independent variables (e.g. trust, moral obligation, habit, and self-identity) need to be reported in a future study. Originality/value – This study contributes to and extends our understanding of the halal food purchasing behavior, identifying the rationales for purchasing of halal foods. From a managerial viewpoint, the findings provide support for investment decisions and for decisions relating to the establishment of Malaysia as a halal hub that address and take the concerns and needs of businesses and Malaysian Government agencies into consideration. © 2011, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Buying behaviour; Consumer behaviour; Food products; Malaysia","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-80053219544"

In 1994, about 10 percent of the total international visitors made a visit to an Australian winery, an increase of 20 percent on the 1993 figures. Some researchers seek to explore wine tourism as a form of consumer behaviour in which wine lovers and those interested in wine regions travel to preferred destinations. Key researchers, in this emerging field of wine tourism, have commented on the lack of published research material available regarding the behaviour and characteristics of the winery visitor or the tourist. This paper addresses these issues by suggesting a model possessing three dimensions; purpose of visit, general tourist motivation and relationship to other tourist activities. With this model, it is possible to locate specific tourist activities, and thereby have a better understanding of what constitutes 'wine tourism'. It also considers whether or not specific cultural and geographic differences may have an impact on the segmentation of the wine tourist. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Furthermore, it was found that future intention to use P2P accommodation was again determined by enjoyment and value. By differentiating guests based on their chosen types of accommodation, the analysis revealed that social benefits influence guest satisfaction for those staying in a private room that involved cohabitation with hosts, but that this was an insignificant factor for guest satisfaction for those staying in an entire home or apartment.

In addition, high arousal increases consumer intentions to visit and make purchases in the store for recreationally oriented consumers, but it has a negative impact on shopping behavior for task-oriented consumers.

The practical usefulness of the framework is illustrated by evidence of the interactive effects of information and material incentives - typical interventions in the personal and contextual domains, respectively. The author concludes that incentives and information have different functions, so that efforts focused on only one are sometimes misplaced; however, properly deployed, they can have synergistic effects on behavior.

It is suggested that the characteristics of products and websites that are encountered early in online browsing can significantly influence the level of arousal and pleasure that consumers experience, and thereby can influence their later shopping behavior. Two experiments show that if the initial experiences encountered in a simulated Internet shopping trip are higher in pleasure, then there is a positive impact on approach behaviors and subjects engage in more arousing activities (e.g., more exploration, more tendencies to examine novel products and stores, higher response to promotional incentives). Further, if higher stimulation or information load is provided by the initial Internet experience, then consumers subsequently tend to engage in less arousing activities. © 2002 by New York University.

Using a unique six-month panel data set of several hundred keywords collected from a large nationwide retailer that advertises on Google, we empirically model the relationship between different sponsored search metrics such as click-through rates, conversion rates, cost per click, and ranking of advertisements. Our paper proposes a novel framework to better understand the factors that drive differences in these metrics. We use a hierarchical Bayesian modeling framework and estimate the model using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. Using a simultaneous equations model, we quantify the relationship between various keyword characteristics, position of the advertisement, and the landing page quality score on consumer search and purchase behavior as well as on advertiser's cost per click and the search engine's ranking decision. Specifically, we find that the monetary value of a click is not uniform across all positions because conversion rates are highest at the top and decrease with rank as one goes down the search engine results page. Though search engines take into account the current period's bid as well as prior click-through rates before deciding the final rank of an advertisement in the current period, the current bid has a larger effect than prior clickthrough rates. We also find that an increase in landing page quality scores is associated with an increase in conversion rates and a decrease in advertiser's cost per click. Furthermore, our analysis shows that keywords that have more prominent positions on the search engine results page, and thus experience higher click-through or conversion rates, are not necessarily the most profitable ones-profits are often higher at the middle positions than at the top or the bottom ones. Besides providing managerial insights into search engine advertising, these results shed light on some key assumptions made in the theoretical modeling literature in sponsored search. © 2009 INFORMS.","Click-through rates; Conversion rates; Cost per click; Electronic commerce; Hierarchical bayesian modeling; Internet monetization; Keyword ranking; Online advertising; Paid search; Search engines","Bayesian networks; Costs; Economics; Electronic commerce; Engines; Image retrieval; Internet; Landing; Markov processes; Monte Carlo methods; Profitability; Quality control; Search engines; Click-through rates; Conversion rates; Hierarchical bayesian modeling; Keyword ranking; Online advertising; Paid search; World Wide Web","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-70350266245"

Design/methodology/approach The paper examines elements of green marketing theory and practice over the past 15 years by employing the logic of the classic paper from 1985 “Has marketing failed, or was it never really tried” of seeking to identify “false marketings” that have hampered progress. Findings That much of what has been commonly referred to as “green marketing” has been underpinned by neither a marketing, nor an environmental, philosophy. Five types of misconceived green marketing are identified and analysed: green spinning, green selling, green harvesting, enviropreneur marketing and compliance marketing. Practical implications Provides an alternative viewpoint on a much researched, but still poorly understood area of marketing, and explains why the anticipated “green revolution” in marketing prefaced by market research findings, has not more radically changed products and markets in practice. Originality/value Helps readers to understand why progress towards a more sustainable economy has proved so difficult, and outlines some of the more radical changes in thought and practice that marketing will need to adopt before it can make a substantive contribution towards greater sustainability. © 2005, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Consumer behaviour; Green marketing; Sustainable development","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-26644439923"

WOM is especially important in the hospitality and tourism industry, whose intangible products are difficult to evaluate prior to their consumption. When WOM becomes digital, the large-scale, anonymous, ephemeral nature of the Internet induces new ways of capturing, analyzing, interpreting, and managing the influence that one consumer may have on another. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the impact of electronic WOM (eWOM) on a tourism destination choice, using the theory of planned behaviour (TPB). Further, an effort was employed to determine the effect of past travel experience on using eWOM and TPB constructs. Design/methodology/approach: A structural equation modeling procedure was applied to the examination of the influences of eWOM on attitudes towards visiting Isfahan, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, and travel intention. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was utilised in order to analysing the relations between these constructs and past travel experience. The research model was tested empirically using a sample of 296 inbound tourists who had experience within the online communities and travelled to Isfahan during the period of research. Findings: Findings indicate that online WOM communications have a significant impact on attitudes toward visiting Isfahan, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, and intention to travel. In addition, travel experience has a significant impact on using eWOM and TPB constructs. Practical implications: The paper suggests that eWOM activity is more complex than previous research has argued. Managers should consider various eWOM facets and try to motivate tourists for participating in online travel communities and to build online travel communities with characteristics such usefulness and ease of use. Originality/value: There has been a lot of marketing research on eWOM but none has focused on covering eWOM in tourism industry and its impact on tourism destination choice by adding new dimension of eWOM to the theory of planned behavior. This paper seeks to fill this gap. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Consumer behaviour; Electronic word of mouth; Internet; Iran; Theory of planned behavior; Tourism","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84867748950"

However, current product search engines fail to effectively leverage information created across diverse social media platforms. Moreover, current ranking algorithms in these product search engines tend to induce consumers to focus on one single product characteristic dimension (e.g., price, star rating). This approach largely ignores consumers' multidimensional preferences for products. In this paper, we propose to generate a ranking system that recommends products that provide, on average, the best value for the consumer's money. The key idea is that products that provide a higher surplus should be ranked higher on the screen in response to consumer queries. We use a unique data set of U.S. hotel reservations made over a three-month period through Travelocity, which we supplement with data from various social media sources using techniques from text mining, image classification, social geotagging, human annotations, and geomapping. We propose a random coefficient hybrid structural model, taking into consideration the two sources of consumer heterogeneity the different travel occasions and different hotel characteristics introduce. Based on the estimates from the model, we infer the economic impact of various location and service characteristics of hotels. We then propose a new hotel ranking system based on the average utility gain a consumer receives from staying in a particular hotel. By doing so, we can provide customers with the ""best-value"" hotels early on. Our user studies, using ranking comparisons from several thousand users, validate the superiority of our ranking system relative to existing systems on several travel search engines. On a broader note, this paper illustrates how social media can be mined and incorporated into a demand estimation model in order to generate a new ranking system in product search engines. We thus highlight the tight linkages between user behavior on social media and search engines. Our interdisciplinary approach provides several insights for using machine learning techniques in economics and marketing research. © 2012 INFORMS.","Crowdsourcing; Hotels; Ranking system; Search engines; Social media; Structural models; Text mining; User-generated content","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84861665218"

Furthermore, we highlight technology's evolutionary role in the development of these power sources and discuss the nature of shifts in power from marketers to consumers in terms of each source. The framework organizes prior marketing literature on Internet-enabled consumer empowerment and highlights gaps in current research.

This has important implications for theorists and managers, as overcoming barriers that cause resistance to innovation calls for marketing approaches other than promoting reasons for adoption of new products and services. Consumer behavior frameworks in diffusion of innovation (DOI) studies have largely failed to distinctly account for reasons against adoption. Indeed, no study to date has tested the relative influence of adoption and resistance factors in a single framework. This research aims to address this shortcoming by applying a novel consumer behavior model (i.e., behavioral reasoning theory) to test the relative influence of both reasons for and, importantly, reasons against adoption in consumers’ innovation adoption decisions. Based on two empirical studies, one with a product and a second with a service innovation, findings demonstrate that behavioral reasoning theory provides a suitable framework to model the mental processing of innovation adoption. Implications for managers and researchers are discussed. © 2014, Academy of Marketing Science.","Adoption of innovation; Behavioral reasoning theory; Consumer behavior; Resistance to innovation","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84930866761"

To explain this phenomenon, we show that habits are a specific form of automaticity in which responses are directly cued by the contexts (e.g., locations, preceding actions) that consistently covaried with past performance. Habits are prepotent responses that are quick to activate in memory over alternatives and that have a slow-to-modify memory trace. In daily life, the tendency to act on habits is compounded by everyday demands, including time pressures, distraction, and self-control depletion. However, habits are not immune to deliberative processes. Habits are learned largely as people pursue goals in daily life, and habits are broken through the strategic deployment of effortful self-control. Also, habits influence the post hoc inferences that people make about their behavior. © 2009 Society for Consumer Psychology.","Automaticity; Consumer behavior; Goals; Habit; Self-control","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-70449622756"

Findings: The results demonstrate strong relationships between the two antecedents (trust and identification) and brand love, and between brand love and its consequences (brand commitment, positive word of mouth, and propensity to pay a higher price for the brand). Originality/value: Through the causal approach and proposed nomological model, the authors discriminate brand love from three important relational constructs (i.e. brand trust, brand identification and brand commitment) and establish the relationships among the constructs. Following recommendations in prior research, the predictive ability of the different relational constructs (trust, identification, commitment and love) are compared and the relevance of brand love for understanding consumer-brand relationships is demonstrated. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Brand love; Brands; Commitment; Consumer behaviour; Identification; Trust; Word of mouth","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84878230818"

Under the low-carbon environment, it is an important task for supply chain members to reduce carbon emissions through low-carbon progressing. This paper focuses on the emission reduction behaviors for the chain members in both the retail-channel and dual-channel cases using the Stackelberg game model. The paper analyzes a detailed model which incorporates both cap-and-trade regulation and consumers' low-carbon preference. The results suggest that when the degree of consumers' low-carbon sensitivity satisfies certain conditions, the introduction of the online channel is profitable for the manufacturer. In addition, the cap-and-trade mechanism is acceptable for supply chain members when consumers have strong low-carbon preference. Furthermore, two emission reduction strategies are compared, including single manufacturer's emission reduction in production strategy and joint emission reduction strategy, of which entails manufacturer's and retailer's emission reduction. It can be concluded that the joint emission reduction strategy is more profitable for both the manufacturer and the retailer. When considering consumers' low-carbon preference, the retailer always has motivation to implement low-carbon promotion though without the manufacturer's incentives. The low-carbon promotion can help achieve emission reduction goals, promote economic development and social progress. The results can provide useful insights for policy-makers to implement effective regulations and for decision-makers to implement sustainability initiatives. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Cap-and-trade; Carbon emission reduction; Dual-channel; Low carbon preference; Supply chain","Commerce; Decision making; Manufacture; Profitability; Sales; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Cap and trade; Carbon emission reductions; Consumers' preferences; Dual channel; Economic development; Emission reduction strategy; Low carbon; Production strategy; Emission control","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84994415991"

In this paper, we analyse and discuss several empirical data sets from Germany, characterising this user group from both a user and a product perspective, i.e. who is willing to buy an EV and who should buy one. Our results show that the most likely group of private EV buyers in Germany are middle-aged men with technical professions living in rural or suburban multi-person households. They own a large share of vehicles in general, are more likely to profit from the economical benefits of these vehicles due to their annual vehicle kilometres travelled and the share of inner-city driving. They state a higher willingness to buy electric vehicles than other potential adopter groups and their higher socio-economic status allows them to purchase EVs. In contrast to this, inhabitants of major cities are less likely to buy EVs since they form a small group of car owners in general, their mileage is too low for EVs to pay off economically and they state lower interest and lower willingness to pay for EVs than other groups. Our results indicate that transport policy promoting EVs should focus on middle-aged men with families from rural and sub-urban cities as first private EV buyers. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Consumer behaviour; Early adopter; Electric vehicles; Market diffusion","Germany; Commerce; Consumer behavior; Electric automobiles; Electric vehicles; Sales; Urban transportation; Car manufacturers; Early adopter; Economical benefits; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Local emissions; Socio-economic status; Transport policy; Willingness to pay; consumption behavior; electric vehicle; socioeconomic status; technology adoption; transportation policy; willingness to pay; Automobile manufacture","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84907027162"

Consumers' attitudes toward green purchase, in turn, are also found to affect their actual green purchase behavior via the mediator role of green purchase intention. However, one of the other important findings suggests that the link between intention and actual purchase is weak.

More important, the data show that inferences drawn from a company’s prosocial actions are strong enough to alter the product evaluations even when consumers can directly observe and experience the product. The data further show that this effect is a function of the moral undertone of the company’s motivation for engaging in socially responsible behavior and is attenuated when consumers believe that the company’s behavior is driven by self-interest rather than by benevolence. By documenting that social goodwill can benefit consumer perceptions of product performance, these findings show that doing good can indeed translate into doing well. © 2015 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc.

Identifying the cause(s) of emotions has clear practical import to the understanding of consumer behaviour. Cognitive appraisal theory serves this purpose; however, a consensus has not yet emerged concerning terminology, number of relevant concepts and concomitant construct measurements, and theoretical linkages between constructs. This paper attempts to rectify this shortcoming. Design/methodology/approach - This conceptual paper provides an extant review of emotions literature as it pertains to cognitive appraisals and consumption behaviours. Based on this review an integrative cognitive appraisal theory is advanced that is parsimonious and incorporates similarities across the various appraisal theory perspectives to date. Findings - Four appraisals are proffered that appear capable of implicating specific emotions and their effects on consumer behaviour. The appraisals advanced are outcome desirability that encompasses pleasantness and goal consistency, agency which includes responsibility and controllability, fairness, and certainty. Sample propositions concerning how cognitive appraisals affect information processing extensiveness have also been provided. Originality/value - First, the paper provides an extant review of cognitive appraisal theories of emotions, which makes transparent the looseness in terminology and differences in theoretical perspectives that currently exist. Second, based on this review the paper advances a unifying theory of consumption appraisals and explore their relevance to marketers. The theory proposed could explain inconsistent findings in the current literature. Third, directions for future research highlighting confounds that should be considered in study designs complete the paper. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Cognition; Consumer behaviour","","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-34249685463"

This paper provides a framework to uncover consumers' perceived price of nonlinear price schedules. I exploit price variation at spatial discontinuities in electricity service areas, where households in the same city experience substantially different nonlinear pricing. Using household-level panel data from administrative records, I find strong evidence that consumers respond to average price rather than marginal or expected marginal price. This suboptimizing behavior makes nonlinear pricing unsuccessful in achieving its policy goal of energy conservation and critically changes the welfare implications of nonlinear pricing.

Product markets are defined as socially constructed knowledge structures (i.e., product conceptual systems) that are shared among producers and consumers - sharing that enables consumers and producers to interact in the market. The fundamental thesis is that product markets are neither imposed nor orchestrated by producers or consumers but evolve from producer-consumer interaction feedback effects. Starting as unstable, incomplete, and disjointed conceptual systems held by market actors - which is revealed by the cacophony of uses, claims, and product standards that characterize emerging product markets - product markets become coherent as a result of consumers and producers making sense of each other's behaviors. The authors further argue that the sensemaking process is revealed in the stories that consumers and producers tell each other in published media, such as industry newspapers and consumer magazines, which the authors use as data sources. Specific hypotheses pertaining to the use of product category labels in published sources and the acceptability of different product category members throughout the development process are tested for the minivan market between 1982 and 1988. The findings suggest that category stabilization causes significant differences between consumers and producers in how they use product category labels for emerging and preexisting categories. The findings also show that, as stabilization occurs around a category prototype, the acceptability of particular models changes without any physical changes to the models.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0033459457"

Theoretical predictions are discussed, and theoretical extensions of the model are reviewed. Empirical research that tests the predictions of the model or studies causality between years of formal schooling completed and good health is surveyed. The model views health as a durable capital stock that yields an output of healthy time. Individuals inherit an initial amount of this stock that depreciates with age and can be increased by investment. The household production function model of consumer behavior is employed to account for the gap between health as an output and medical care as one of many inputs into its production. In this framework the ""shadow price"" of health depends on many variables besides the price of medical care. It is shown that the shadow price rises with age if the rate of depreciation on the stock of health rises over the life cycle and falls with education (years of formal schooling completed) if more educated people are more efficient producers of health. An important result is that, under certain conditions, an increase in the shadow price may simultaneously reduce the quantity of health demanded and increase the quantities of health inputs demanded. © 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Yet there is little research about how social media use is associated with consumer-brand relationships. We conducted three studies to explore how individual and national differences influence the relationship between social media use and customer brand relationships. The first study surveyed customers in France, the U.K. and U.S. and compared those who engage with their favorite brands via social media with those who do not. The findings indicated that social media use was positively related with brand relationship quality and the effect was more pronounced with high anthropomorphism perceptions (the extent to which consumers' associate human characteristics with brands). Two subsequent experiments further validated these findings and confirmed that cultural differences, specifically uncertainty avoidance, moderated these results. We obtained robust and convergent results from survey and experimental data using both student and adult consumer samples and testing across three product categories (athletic shoes, notebook computers, and automobiles). The results offer cross-national support for the proposition that engaging customers via social media is associated with higher consumer-brand relationships and word of mouth communications when consumers anthropomorphize the brand and they avoid uncertainty. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Anthropomorphism; Brand relationship quality; Social media; Uncertainty avoidance; Word of mouth","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84937250400"

Design/methodology/approach: This conceptual paper offers an in-depth literature review on servicescape topics from a variety of disciplines, both inside and outside marketing, to advance a logical framework built on Bitner's seminal article (1992). Findings: A servicescape comprises not only objective, measureable, and managerially controllable stimuli but also subjective, immeasurable, and often managerially uncontrollable social, symbolic, and natural stimuli, which all influence customer approach/avoidance decisions and social interaction behaviors. Furthermore, customer responses to social, symbolic, and natural stimuli are often the drivers of profound person-place attachments. Research limitations/implications: The framework supports a servicescape paradigm that links marketing, environmental/natural psychology, humanistic geography, and sociology. Practical implications: Although managers can easily control a service firm's physical stimuli, they need to understand how other critical environmental stimuli influence consumer behavior and which stimuli might overweigh a customer's response to a firm's physical dimensions. Social implications: The paper shows how a servicescape's naturally restorative dimension can promote relief from mental fatigue and improve customer health and well-being. Thus, government institutions (e.g. schools, hospitals) can improve people's lives by creating natural servicescapes that have restorative potential. Originality/value: The framework organizes more than 25 years of servicescape research in a cogent framework that has cross-disciplinary implications. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Atmospherics; Attention restoration theory; Consumer behaviour; Decision making; Environmental psychology; Marketing; Service design; Servicescape","","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-80052610631"

We find that with the combined bundle of attributes offered by vehicles available today, gasoline vehicles continue in both countries to be most attractive to consumers, and American respondents have significantly lower relative willingness-to-pay for BEV technology than Chinese respondents. While U.S. and Chinese subsidies are similar, favoring vehicles with larger battery packs, differences in consumer preferences lead to different outcomes. Our results suggest that with or without each country's 2012-2013 subsidies, Chinese consumers are willing to adopt today's BEVs and mid-range PHEVs at similar rates relative to their respective gasoline counterparts, whereas American consumers prefer low-range PHEVs despite subsidies. This implies potential for earlier BEV adoption in China, given adequate supply. While there are clear national security benefits for adoption of BEVs in China, the local and global social impact is unclear: With higher electricity generation emissions in China, a transition to BEVs may reduce oil consumption at the expense of increased air pollution and/or greenhouse gas emissions. On the other hand, demand from China could increase global incentives for electric vehicle technology development with the potential to reduce emissions in countries where electricity generation is associated with lower emissions. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","China; Conjoint analysis; Discrete choice modeling; Federal subsidy policy; Vehicle electrification; Willingness-to-pay","China; United States; Battery Pack; Digital storage; Electric drives; Electric power generation; Gas emissions; Gasoline; Greenhouse gases; National security; China; Conjoint analysis; Discrete choice models; Vehicle electrifications; Willingness to pay; consumption behavior; discrete choice analysis; electric vehicle; electricity generation; electrification; emission control; social impact; subsidy system; willingness to pay; Plug-in hybrid vehicles","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84922739662"

Greater personalization typically increases service relevance and customer adoption, but paradoxically, it also may increase customers' sense of vulnerability and lower adoption rates. To demonstrate this contradiction, an exploratory field study on Facebook and secondary data about a personalized advertising campaign indicate sharp drops in click-through rates when customers realize their personal information has been collected without their consent. To investigate the personalization paradox, this study uses three experiments that confirm a firm's strategy for collecting information from social media websites is a crucial determinant of how customers react to online personalized advertising. When firms engage in overt information collection, participants exhibit greater click-through intentions in response to more personalized advertisements, in contrast with their reactions when firms collect information covertly. This effect reflects the feelings of vulnerability that consumers experience when firms undertake covert information collection strategies. Trust-building marketing strategies that transfer trust from another website or signal trust with informational cues can offset this negative effect. These studies help unravel the personalization paradox by explicating the role of information collection and its impact on vulnerability and click-through rates. © 2014 New York University.","Information collection; Personalization paradox; Psychological ownership; Trust-building strategies; Vulnerability","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84921753510"

Using data from the economic sociology module of the 1996 General Social Survey, we document high levels of within-network exchanges. We argue that transacting with social contacts is effective because it embeds commercial exchanges in a web of obligations and holds the seller's network hostage to appropriate role performance in the economic transaction. It follows that within-network exchanges will be more common in risky transactions that are unlikely to be repeated and in which uncertainty is high. The data support this view. Self-reports about major purchases are consistent with the expectation that exchange frequency reduces the extent of within-network exchanges. Responses to questions about preferences for in-group exchanges support the argument that uncertainty about product and performance quality leads people to prefer sellers with whom they have noncommercial ties. Moreover, people prefer to avoid selling to social contacts under the same conditions that lead buyers to seek such transactions; and people who transact with friends and relatives report greater satisfaction with the results than do people who transact with strangers, especially for risk-laden exchanges.","","consumption behavior; goods exchange; networking","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0031743966"

BE has been defined as the level of a consumer's ""cognitive, emotional and behavioral investment in specific brand interactions"". Although pioneering research provides exploratory insights, the majority of literature to-date addresses consumers' specific positively-valenced BE; thus largely overlooking potential negatively-valenced manifestations of this emerging concept and their ensuing implications. The purpose of this paper is to propose a novel BE conceptualization that extends to cover focal negatively-valenced, in addition to positively-valenced BE expressions, thus providing a more comprehensive theoretical model of BE. Specifically, while positively-valenced BE addresses consumers' favorable/affirmative cognitive, emotional and behavioral brand-related dynamics during focal brand interactions (e.g. brand-usage); negatively-valenced BE, by contrast, is exhibited through consumers' unfavorable brand-related thoughts, feelings, and behaviors during brand interactions. Design/methodology/approach: Drawing on netnographic methodology, the authors develop a conceptual model addressing the key characteristics of consumers' positively-/negatively-valenced BE, and derive a set of key BE triggers and consequences. Findings: Based on their analyses the authors develop a conceptual model, which addresses consumers' positively/negatively valenced BE, and key antecedents and consequences. Research limitations/implications: Future research is required, which tests and validates the proposed model for specific categories and brands using large-scale, quantitative analyses. Practical implications: Generating enhanced managerial understanding of positively/negatively valenced BE, this research contributes to guiding managerial decision making regarding the management of specific brands. Originality/value: By proposing a conceptual model incorporating positively-/negatively-valenced BE, this paper extends current insights in the branding/marketing literatures, thus contributing to managers and scholars. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Brand engagement; Conceptual model; Netnography","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84897095131"

The 3D virtual world provides opportunities for destination marketing organizations to communicate with targeted markets by offering a rich environment for potential visitors to explore tourism destinations. However, as of yet, there is little understanding about how to effectively market tourism destinations to virtual world participants who are technology users as well as potential consumers. The purpose of the present study is to develop a research framework that integrates the technology acceptance model (TAM) and self-determination theory to understand how tourists use a 3D virtual world. Primary data were obtained for this study through self-administered Web questionnaires. The data were conducted in a laboratory setting with 186 participants. This study contributes to the empirical TAM literature by applying the model to a 3D virtual tourism site. Additionally, this study provides a research framework to capture the entertainment nature of a 3D virtual world by extending the TAM to incorporate psychological elements of self-determination theory to understand consumer experience.

Lewin's (1951) concept of action research highlights the scientific and societal value of translating psychological research into community problem-solving strategies. Implicit in Lewin's formulation is the importance of achieving effective collaboration among behavioral researchers, community members and policy makers. The present analysis builds on Lewin's analysis by outlining programmatic directions for the scientific study of transdisciplinary research and community action. Three types of collaboration, and the contextual circumstances that facilitate or hinder them, are examined: (1) collaboration among scholars representing different disciplines; (2) collaboration among researchers from multiple fields and community practitioners representing diverse professional and lay perspectives; and (3) collaboration among community organizations across local, state, national, and international levels. In the present analysis, transdisciplinary action research is viewed as a topic of scientific study in its own right to achieve a more complete understanding of prior collaborations and to identify strategies for refining and sustaining future collaborations (and their intended outcomes) among researchers, community members and organizations. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2006.","Action research; Collaboration; Community coalitions; Inter-sectoral partnerships; Interdisciplinary; Transdisciplinary","Concept Formation; Consumer Participation; Cooperative Behavior; Health Services Research; Interdisciplinary Communication; Policy Making; Psychology, Social; Sociology; United States; article; concept formation; consumer; cooperation; health services research; interdisciplinary communication; management; organization and management; social psychology; sociology; United States","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-33749252545"

In the first stage, the authors use data from surveyed consumers to predict the presurvey latent purchase intentions of both surveyed and nonsurveyed consumers. In the second stage, they compare the strength of the association between the presurvey latent intentions and the postsurvey behavior across both groups. The authors find large and reliable self-generated validity effects across three diverse large-scale field studies. On average, the correlation between latent intentions and purchase behavior is 58% greater among surveyed consumers than it is among similar nonsurveyed consumers. One study also shows that the reactive effect of the measurement of purchase intentions is entirely mediated by self-generated validity and not by social norms, intention modification, or other measurement effects that are independent of presurvey latent intentions.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-17544378718"

The proposed STAM extended previous technology acceptance models and theories by adding age-related health and ability characteristics of older people. The proposed STAM was empirically tested using a cross-sectional questionnaire survey with a sample of 1012 seniors aged 55 and over in Hong Kong. The result showed that STAM was strongly supported and could explain 68% of the variance in the use of gerontechnology. For older Hong Kong Chinese, individual attributes, which include age, gender, education, gerontechnology self-efficacy and anxiety, and health and ability characteristics, as well as facilitating conditions explicitly and directly affected technology acceptance. These were better predictors of gerontechnology usage behaviour (UB) than the conventionally used attitudinal factors (usefulness and ease of use).

The purpose of this paper is to test a more comprehensive model consisting of reputation and website quality (stimuli), cognition and emotion (organism) and purchase intention (response). Design/methodology/approach: In total, 219 usable questionnaires were obtained at a large Midwestern university through online survey. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was employed for data analyses. Findings: Reputation had a significant positive effect on consumers' emotion and significant negative effect on perceived risk. All four website quality dimensions had significant negative effects on perceived risk and significant positive effects on emotion, except for customer service. Perceived risk had a significant negative effect on consumers' emotion, and both perceived risk and emotion had a significant impact on purchase intention. Research limitations/implications: This research employed convenience sampling, which resulted in a majority of female respondents. The results may be generalized to a limited extent. Originality/value: This study allows for empirical examination of the different effects of various components of retail websites on emotion, perceived risk and behavioral intentions.

This phenomenon is known as the discrepancy between what consumers say about their growing concern regarding the environment, on the one hand, and what they truly do to help sustain this environment, on the other hand. Although reviews of the motivations and barriers of green consumption are available in the literature, none of them focuses on the green gap, nor examines the methodologies and paradigms used in the available studies. Given the importance of methodology in creating the green gap, and considering the effect of the adopted paradigm on the reliability of the results, it is essential to identify these two aspects in each reviewed study. In this work, we use a pre-assigned framework to categorize 58 articles addressing the green gap, based on the theory, methodology, and paradigm applied in each article. An overview of the studies shows that despite the diversity of methods used, there is still room for improvement in terms of methodology, paradigm, and theory. Most importantly, qualitative studies and experimental designs are needed, and the rational paradigm must not be replaced by but should instead complement the current trend that favors the behavioral economic. As for the theoretical improvements, the research focus must shift from exploring the reasons behind the gap to implementing solutions to it. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Attitude; Behavior; Consumption; Environmental; Green gap; Intention; Purchase; Sustainable","Production engineering; Behavioral economics; Future research directions; Gap phenomenon; Green consumption; Qualitative study; Research focus; Sustainable consumption; Industrial engineering","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85088844403"

This research seeks to better understand why, despite concern towards the environment (attitude), consumers fail to purchase environmentally friendly or green products (behavior). Design/methodology/approach - A survey instrument was developed that used scales to measure eight independent and one dependent variable. In addition, socio-demographic data were also collected about the study participants. To discriminate between green and non-green buyers, classification with discriminant analysis was used. Findings - The framework presented contributes to the environmental consumerism literature by framing the attitude-behavior gap as a social dilemma and draws on reference group theory to identify individual factors to help understand the gap and suggest ways in which to bridge it. Results from the study reveal that several characteristics of the individual - trust, in-group identity, expectation of others' cooperation and perceived efficacy - were significant in differentiating between ""non-green"" and ""green"" buyers. Practical implications - The results of the study offer several managerial implications. First, marketers should reinforce the role trust plays in solidifying collective action. Second, because of the strong influence of reference groups in green buying, marketing communications managers should use spokespeople who are relatable. Third, the study showed that expectation of others' cooperation significantly identifies green buyers. Fourth, to address the perception of personal efficacy, it is important that green marketers emphasize the difference that individual action makes for the collective good. Originality/value - The research draws on both social dilemma and reference group theories to investigate the determinants of and the mechanisms to explain the rationale behind the attitude-behavior gap as it pertains to a specific environmental issue - energy conservation. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Buying behaviour; Consumer behaviour; Environmental politics; Influence","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-70350328457"

Focusing on participants' choices, Studies 1 and 2 showed that participants from WK relative to MD contexts more often chose pens that appeared similar to, rather than different from, other pens in the choice set, and more often chose the same images as another participant. Examining participants' responses to others' choices, Studies 3 and 4 demonstrated that participants from WK relative to MD contexts liked their chosen pens more when a confederate chose similarly and responded more positively when a friend chose the same car in a hypothetical scenario. Finally, Study 5 found that car advertisements targeting WK rather than MD consumers more often emphasized connection to, rather than differentiation from, others, suggesting that models of agency are reflected in pervasive cultural products. © 2007 American Psychological Association.","choice; culture; educational attainment; models of agency; social class","Adult; Choice Behavior; Educational Status; Female; Humans; Male; Models, Psychological; Research; Social Class; Social Conformity; United States; adult; article; decision making; educational status; female; human; male; psychological model; research; social class; social psychology; United States","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-36048931423"

Environmental sustainability is the foremost topic in the contemporary tourism and hospitality industry. Environmentally-sustainable consumer behavior is an important aspect of environmental protection, which eventually benefits the society. In order to better understand environmentally-sustainable consumption and promote environmentally responsible consumer behavior, this research provides a sound conceptualization of environmentally-sustainable consumer behavior, and presents a systematic review and perspective on theories (theory of reasoned action, norm activation theory, theory of planned behavior, model of goal-directed behavior, and value-belief-norm theory) established in tourism and environmental psychology. In addition, this study introduces the essential drivers of environmentally-sustainable consumer behavior (green image, pro-environmental behavior in everyday life, environmental knowledge, green product attachment, descriptive social norm, anticipated pride and guilt, environmental corporate social responsibility, perceived effectiveness, connectedness to nature, and green value). Lastly, this paper provides the values of the latest studies on the special issue of environmental sustainability and consumer behavior in tourism and hospitality. This study as an introductory paper along with other articles in this special section help enable a collaboration platform across tourism and hospitality fields in pursuit of universal goals for promoting pro-environmental consumption and environmental sustainability. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","environmental sustainability; Environmentally-sustainable consumer behavior; key drivers of eco-friendly behaviors; theories related to environmentally-sustainable behaviors; tourism and hospitality","consumption behavior; corporate social responsibility; ecotourism; environmental economics; environmental management; hospitality industry; sustainability; sustainable development; tourism economics","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85102956092"

Prior research on need for cognition has used only long messages, counterattitudinal topics, or employed instructions that specifically told participants to evaluate products. Results of our studies reveal that need for cognition also affects the processes of attitude change when no explicit evaluation instructions are provided and when exposures are to relatively short, unfamiliar advertising messages presented in either self-paced or externally controlled formats. Consistent with prior research, attitudes of high need for cognition individuals were based more on an evaluation of product attributes than were the attitudes of low need for cognition persons (Studies 1 and 2). In addition, the attitudes of low need for cognition individuals were based more on simple peripheral cues inherent in the ads than were the attitudes of high need for cognition persons (Study 3).

A review of the literature regarding dysfunctional customer behavior finds limited attention devoted to the effects of such behavior. To explore the nature and dynamics of dysfunctional customer behavior, field research was conducted and extant theory evaluated leading to the development of a propositional inventory and a framework of the effects of such behavior.

While technical specifications and potentially biased selling points can be gleaned from corporate web sites, online brand communities are becoming essential conduits for the customer-to-customer (C2C) sharing of product information and experiences. This study develops and tests a model of online C2C communications in developing desirable online brand community outcomes. Two studies were used to test the model. In Study 1, a netnography technique was employed and conversations between brand community members were coded and combined with survey data to test the research model. In Study 2 an experiment was conducted to further test the sequence of events in our base model. Our findings show that online brand communities are effective tools for influencing sales, regardless of whether these communities reside on company-owned or independently-owned websites. In addition, we demonstrate interesting asymmetrical effects, whereby the positive information shared by community members has a stronger moderating influence on purchase behavior than negative information. Further, we find that online brand communities are effective customer retention tools for retaining both experienced and novice customers.

Using a temporally lagged design, one hundred and seventy-two respondents answered four questionnaires over a period of 14 months. Questionnaires measured emotions in relation to food waste, habits, the TPB variables, intention to reduce food waste, and self-reported food waste behaviour. Results showed that the less well-studied variables of habits and emotions were important determinants of participants’ intentions to reduce food waste and their current food waste behaviour. As expected, we found that negative emotions were associated with greater intentions to reduce food waste, but contrary to our predictions they were also associated with higher levels of food waste behaviour. In other words, participants who experienced more negative emotion when thinking about food waste intended to reduce their waste but actually ended up wasting more food. Results also show that participants with a greater sense of control, and more normative support for reducing food waste also had stronger intentions to engage in the behaviour. Our findings extend existing understanding and underscore the importance of the non-cognitive determinants of behaviour, namely emotions and habits.

Typically, consumers willingly buy from unknown sellers within an e-marketplace, despite the apparent risk, since they trust the institutional mechanisms furnished by the relatively well-known intermediary. Consumers' trust in one component of the e-marketplace merchant may not only affect their trust in the other, but also influence the way consumers make online purchases. This paper explores the impact of trust on consumer behavior in e-marketplaces. An empirical study has been conducted to accomplish our research objectives, using a questionnaire survey of 222 active e-marketplace shoppers in Korea. The results reveal that consumer trust in an intermediary has a strong influence upon both attitudinal loyalty and purchase intentions, although consumer trust in the community of sellers has no significant effect on the two constructs representing consumer behavior. In addition, it was found that trust is transferred from an intermediary to the community of sellers, implying that the trustworthiness of the intermediary plays a critical role in determining the extent to which consumers trust and accept the sellers in the e-marketplace.

In addition, various strategies for changing consumer behaviour in an environment-friendly direction are considered. Information, moral arguments, and economic incentives are discussed as instruments for change. In setting goals for change strategies, broad goals such as heightened psychic and communicative activity in matters of environmental concern ought to be considered as an alternative to the elicitation of very specific behaviours. © 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0000316235"

Some useful examples of agent-based modeling have been published in marketing journals, but widespread acceptance of the agent-based modeling method and publication of this method in the highest-level marketing journals have been slowed by the lack of widely accepted standards of how to do agent-based modeling rigorously. We address this need by proposing guidelines for rigorous agent-based modeling. We demonstrate these guidelines, and the value of agent-based modeling for marketing research, through the use of an example. We use an agent-based modeling approach to replicate the Bass model of the diffusion of innovations, illustrating the use of the proposed guidelines to ensure the rigor of the analysis. We also show how extensions of the Bass model that would be difficult to carry out using traditional marketing research techniques are possible to implement using a rigorous agent-based approach. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-80052565478"

The retailer sets an initial stocking quantity and, at some predetermined point in the season, optimally marks down remaining inventory. We modify this classic setting by introducing three types of consumers: myopic consumers, who always purchase at the initial full price; bargain-hunting consumers, who purchase only if the discounted price is sufficiently low; and strategic consumers, who strategically choose when to make their purchase. A strategic consumer chooses between a purchase at the initial full price and a later purchase at an uncertain markdown price. In equilibrium, strategic consumers and the retailer make optimal decisions given their rational expectations regarding future prices, availability of inventory, and the behavior of other consumers. We find that the retailer stocks less, takes smaller price discounts, and earns lower profit if strategic consumers are present than if there are no strategic consumers. We find that a retailer should generally avoid committing to a price path over the season (assuming such commitment is feasible)-committing to a markdown price (or to not mark down at all) is often too costly (inventory may remain unsold) even in the presence of strategic consumers; the better approach is to be cautious with the initial quantity and then mark down optimally. Furthermore, we discuss the value of quick response (the ability to procure additional inventory after obtaining updated demand information, albeit at a higher unit cost than the initial order). We find that the value of quick response to a retailer is generally much greater in the presence of strategic consumers than without them: on average 67% more valuable and as much as 558% more valuable in our sample. In other words, although it is well established in the literature that quick response provides value by allowing better matching of supply with demand, it provides more value, often substantially more value, by allowing a retailer to control the negative consequences of strategic consumer behavior.","Dynamic pricing; Game theory; Quick response; Strategic consumer behavior","Competition; Costs; Dynamic response; Game theory; Consumer behaviors; Demand information; Discounted price; Dynamic pricing; If there are; Optimal decisions; Price discount; Quick response; Rational expectations; Strategic consumer behavior; Uncertain demand; Unit cost; Sales","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-67649922243"

A growing area of this research is the CSR-consumer relationship. Results of experimental studies indicate that consumer attitudes and purchase intentions are influenced by CSR initiatives - if consumers are aware of them. In order to create this awareness, business is increasingly turning to 'pro-social' marketing communications, but such campaigns is met with scepticism and their effectiveness are therefore uncertain. Consequently, researchers in the field (for example, Maignan, 2001; Mohr et al., 2001) have called for empirical studies to determine the level of actual consumer awareness of CSR initiatives. This study examines the Australian banking sector, which engages in and promotes its CSR activities, to help fill this gap. Results from our qualitative study with bank managers, and our quantitative study with consumers, indicate low consumer CSR awareness levels. Consumer understanding of many of the social issues banks engage with is also low. While CSR is effective in eliciting favourable consumer attitudes and behaviour in theory, CSR has not proven its general effectiveness in the marketplace. The low consumer awareness of the various social issues in which firms engage with their CSR programs suggests that firms may need to educate consumers, so they may better contextualise CSR initiatives communicated. However, better context may amount to little if claimed CSR initiatives are perceived as inconsistent with other facets of the business that reflect its values and ethics. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Banks; Communication; Consumer awareness; Corporate social responsibility","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-63349096609"

Yet there are many other factors, such as health concerns, that may also encourage the consumption of 'green' foods. This paper explores the ways in which Australian consumers construct organic food-a sector of the food industry that is currently growing at between 20 and 50 percent per annum but is struggling to keep up with rising consumer demand. In order to examine the significance of 'green' signifiers in the consumption practices of Australian consumers a series of focus group interviews and a national consumer survey were conducted. These examined both those characteristics of food that were valued in general, and those meanings that were associated with organic food in particular. In very general terms, analysis reveals that while consumers believed organic food to be healthy and environmentally sound-both of which were considered desirable-these characteristics were subsumed by an overarching concern with convenience. This does not mean that consumers did not hold genuinely positive environmental attitudes. Rather, it reflects a range of contradictory beliefs and practices that appeared to derive from the discursive conflict between conventional and organic food industries over environmental, health and safety claims. The paper concludes by identifying the barriers and opportunities for expanding the organic industry in Australia in the context of the ways organics is constructed by consumers.","","Australia; agroindustry; consumption behavior; food consumption; organic farming","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0036071590"

First, we provide a review of the extant literature drawing on four major streams of research from (1) previous marketing (servicescapes); (2) environmental psychology (approach–avoidance theory, behavior setting theory); (3) social psychology (social facilitation theory); and (4) organizational behavior (affective events theory). Second, we present a new conceptual model, the ‘Social-servicescape’. In this paper we argue that the social environment and purchase occasion dictates the desired social density which influences customers’ affective and cognitive responses, including repurchase intentions. Furthermore, we argue that customers play a key role in influencing the emotions of others either positively or negatively, and this largely determines whether they intend to return to the service setting.

Ever increasing consumption is putting a strain on the environment. The present work delves into understanding the relationship between environmental concerns and consumer choice behaviour in purchasing green products in the context of India being a large emerging economy in South East Asia. Attempt has been made to examine the influence of consumption values on sustainable consumer behaviour across consumer segments with preferential green choice approach difference. Multiple linear regression analysis, one-way analysis of variance and other standard statistical analysis of the data collected through questionnaire survey have been done. Results indicate that price sensitivity is high regardless of their choice preference. Social value parameter being the dominant factor influences sustainable consumption behaviour adoption among the green preferential cluster. Consumption values differ significantly across consumers exhibiting different preference for products with and without green credentials, being higher for those with green purchase or consumption experience or notion. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Despite concerns regarding the long-term health impact of this product, there is little known about awareness and use of ENDS among adults in the USA. Methods A consumer-based mail-in survey (ConsumerStyles) was completed by 10 587 adults (≥18 years) in 2009 and 10 328 adults in 2010. Data from these surveys were used to monitor awareness, ever use and past month use of ENDS from 2009 to 2010 and to assess demographic characteristics and tobacco use of ENDS users. Results In this US sample, awareness of ENDS doubled from 16.4% in 2009 to 32.2% in 2010 and ever use more than quadrupled from 2009 (0.6%) to 2010 (2.7%). Ever use of ENDS was most common among women and those with lower education, although these were not the groups who had heard of ENDS most often. Current smokers and tobacco users were most likely to try ENDS. However, current smokers who had tried ENDS did not say they planned to quit smoking more often than smokers who had never tried them. Conclusions Given the large increase in awareness and ever use of ENDS during this 1-year period and the unknown impact of ENDS use on cigarette smoking behaviours and long-term health, continued monitoring of these products is needed.","","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Awareness; Data Collection; Educational Status; Electrical Equipment and Supplies; Electronics; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Nicotine; Sex Factors; Smoking; Smoking Cessation; Tobacco Products; United States; Young Adult; nicotine; adolescent; adult; aged; article; awareness; educational status; electrical equipment; electronics; female; human; information processing; male; middle aged; sex difference; smoking; smoking cessation; tobacco; United States","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84871403062"

Digital immersion offers opportunities for people to travel in time, supporting users to experience virtually ancient encounters, space explorations or dangerous natural phenomena, such as volcano eruptions. Users can explore immersive environments for working, learning, transacting, exploring interests and socialising with others. This is already evident in gaming ecosystems, where gamers effectively interact in the metaverse.

Many see it as primarily an attitude-based phenomenon that can be influenced significantly by customer relationship management initiatives such as the increasingly popular loyalty and affinity programs. However, empirical research shows that loyalty in competitive repeat-purchase markets is shaped more by the passive acceptance of brands than by strongly-held attitudes about them. From this perspective, the demand-enhancing potential of loyalty programs is more limited than might be hoped. Reviews three different perspectives on loyalty, and relates these to a framework for understanding customer loyalty that encompasses customer brand commitment, customer brand acceptance and customer brand buying. Uses this framework to analyze the demand-side potential of loyalty programs. Discusses where these programs might work and where, they are unlikely to succeed on any large scale.

First, identities feel stable but are highly sensitive to situational cues. Second, identities include not only content but also readiness to act and to use procedures congruent with the identity. Third, identities can be subtly cued without conscious awareness. Fourth, what an accessible identity means is dynamically constructed in the particular context in which it is cued. Because identities carry action- and procedural-readiness, the outcome of an identity-based motivation process may be similar to or different from the choices an individual would have made in another setting. Moreover, once an identity is formed, action and procedural-readiness can be cued without conscious awareness or systematic processing, resulting in beneficial or iatrogenic outcomes. © 2009.","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-68349155811"

Advances in information technology and the emergence of online social network sites have changed the way information is transmitted. This phenomenon impacts consumers as this easily accessible information could greatly affect the consumption decision. The purpose of this paper is to examine the extent to which e-WOM among consumers can influence brand image and purchase intention in the automobile industry. Design/methodology/approach: Measurement items are adapted from existing scales found in the marketing literature. Academic colleagues reviewed the items for face validity and readability. The scales are evaluated for reliability, convergent validity, and discriminant validity using data collected in a survey of Iran Khodro's prospective customers in Iran. A structural equation modeling procedure is applied to the examination of the influences of e-WOM on brand image and purchase intention. The research model was tested empirically using a sample of 341 respondents who had experience within online communities of customers and referred to Iran Khodro's agencies during the period of research. Findings: The paper found that e-WOM is one of the most effective factors influencing brand image and purchase intention of brands in consumer markets. Research limitations/implications: The paper outlines ways to promote a brand effectively through online customer communities, as well as general tips for website and forum moderators for facilitating such presentation in a manner useful to the members of their online communities. While there is a substantial research stream that examines the branding of consumers goods and an increasing literature on product brands, little is known about brand image in the context of online communications. This paper extends existing measurement of brand image to a new setting, namely e-WOM. Originality/value: This paper provides valuable insight into the measurement of e-WOM, brand image, and purchase intention in the automobile industry and offers a foundation for future product branding research. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Brand image; Consumer behaviour; Internet; Iran; Social networks; Word of mouth","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84863810891"

The current research aims to develop and test an integrative model of factors determining consumers’ acceptance of IoT technology. Design/methodology/approach – Based on technology acceptance model (TAM), the authors proposed an IoT acceptance model that consists of three technology factors (perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and trust); one social context factor (social influence); and two individual user characteristics (perceived enjoyment and perceived behavioral control). Data from 368 Chinese consumers were used to test the research model through the use of structural equation modeling. Findings – The results showed particularly strong support for the effects of perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, social influence, perceived enjoyment, and perceived behavioral control. However, trust played an insignificant role in predicting the intention. In addition, perceived ease of use and trust were found to affect perceived usefulness. Compared with the individual TAM model, the integrated model provides more explanation on user behavioral intention toward IoT usage. Originality/value – The integrated model explores the driving factors of individuals’ willingness to use IoT technology from the perspectives of the technology itself, social context and individual user characteristic. It links the constructs of social influence, enjoyment, and perceived behavioral control to the TAM and successfully extends TAM in the IoT technology context. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Hybrid intelligent business systems; Information systems; Innovation adoption behaviour; Innovation diffusion; RFID application to logistic","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84931054674"

Moreover, the study explores the determinants of effective green purchase behaviour (GPB) considering ECCB and green purchase intention (GPI) previously evaluated. Design/methodology/approach: The authors conducted a quantitative study based on an online survey. Data collection was implemented in two different phases: in the first phase ECCB, GPI and profiling variables were measured. One month later, the same respondents evaluated their effective GPB. Through path analysis the effects of ECCB and GPI on GPB were measured. Findings: The results show that psychographic variables, with emphasis on perceived consumer effectiveness (PCE) and altruism, are more relevant than socio-demographics in explaining ECCB. The consumers with higher ECCB have shown higher green purchase intention (GPI). ECCB has a positive impact on GBP, higher than GPI, which in turn mediates that relationship. Research limitations/implications: The research results may lack generalizability. Therefore, researchers are encouraged to test the proposed propositions further. Practical implications: The paper provides evidence that whenever ecological consciousness is high, the gap between GPI and GPB is less evident, which provides clear evidence that an understanding of green consumer profiles and behaviour can enable organizations to respond better to new management challenges.

Conspicuous consumption occurs in the form of monumental construction, supporting large numbers of energy consumers, production of high energy‐consuming luxury goods, and an emphasis on non‐useful movement (processions, needlessly large rooms, etc.). By expanding the concept of energy‐use to cover conspicuous consumption as well as efficiency of production, it can be seen as a basic factor in shaping the political as well as the economic behaviour of human beings and can explain why, as systems of inequality evolve, monumental architecture becomes an increasingly prominent feature of the archaeological record. This enlarged concept would also broaden a materialist perspective on human behaviour to take account of many significant aspects of the ideational components of such behaviour that appear in the archaeological record. © 1990 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84928831189"

The technique allows one to augment market share data with information relating consumer demographics to the characteristics of the products they purchase. This extra information plays the same role as consumer-level data, allowing estimated substitution patterns and (thus) welfare to directly reflect demographic-driven differences in tastes for observed characteristics. I apply the technique to the automobile market, estimating the economic effects of the introduction of the minivan. I show that models estimated without micro data yield much larger welfare numbers than the model using them, primarily because the micro data appear to free the model from a heavy dependence on the idiosyncratic logit ""taste"" error. I complete the welfare picture by measuring the extent of first-mover advantage and profit cannibalization both initially by the innovator and later by the imitators. My results support a story in which large improvements in consumers' standard of living arise from competition as firms cannibalize each other's profits by seeking new goods that give them some temporary market power.","","automobile industry; consumption behavior; demand analysis; theoretical study","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-0036693747"

A self-administered questionnaire was developed and administered to a non-probabilistic convenience sample of 315 young consumers. The findings of this research indicate that the status-conscious market is more likely to be affected by the symbolic characteristics of a brand; feelings aroused by the brand; and by the degree of congruency between the brand-user's self-image and the brand's image itself. Results also indicate that the higher the symbolic characteristics, the stronger the positive feelings, and the greater the congruency between the consumer and brand image, the greater the likelihood of the brand being perceived as possessing high status elements. The suspicion that status-laden brands would be chosen for status consumption and conspicuous consumption was also confirmed.

The results show the green consumer to be an opinion leader and a careful shopper who seeks information on products, including information from advertising, but also suggest that the green consumer is rather skeptical of advertising.

Powerful forces such as capitalism, global transport, communications, marketing and advertising, and transnational cosmopolitanism are interacting to dissolve the boundaries across national cultures and economies and in the eyes of some, accelerating the emergence of a homogeneous global consumer culture. The conventional method of using countries as the cultural unit of analysis or as a basis for market segmentation, is increasingly ill-advised, given that most of the world's countries are already multicultural and growing ever more so, and even within relatively homogeneous nations, individuals vary substantially in the extent to which they identify with, adhere to, and practice cultural norms. Many researchers argue that increasing globalization is reducing the homogeneity of consumer behaviors within countries, while increasing communalities across countries. Despite the importance of and widespread sociological discourse on this topic, (1) a scarcity of studies exists that have simultaneously considered both global and local cultural influences on consumer behavior, and (2) a scale for measuring how individuals acquire and become a part of this emerging global consumer culture is lacking. This article focuses on the development and validation of a multidimensional scale for the measurement of acculturation to global consumer culture, and is part of a larger international study examining the complex interaction and contextual nature of local and global cultural influences on consumer behavior. The article concludes with a proposed research paradigm intended to model such phenomena. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

A total of 64 articles on this topic published in peer-reviewed tourism journals between January 2000 and June 2012 were included in the review. These articles were written on a number of different disaster contexts, including weather-related events (floods and hurricanes), natural disasters (earthquakes and tsunami) and other events (such as pandemics and terrorist attacks). The key themes that emerged included a lack of communication between stakeholders, media sensationalism, the importance of selecting the most effective marketing messages, lack of disaster-management plans, damage to destination image and reputation, and the changes in tourist behaviour following crises and disasters. The review identifies ways to improve the speed and effectiveness of response to disaster, the importance of relationship marketing with loyal customers and the need to quickly repair destination image. Suggestions for future research arising from this review include the urgent need to encourage tourism operators to engage with crisis preparedness and disaster-management strategies and the importance of gaining a better understanding of the consumer response to disastrous events. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","crisis; destination management; post-disaster recovery; tourism marketing","crisis management; disaster management; disaster relief; extreme event; literature review; natural disaster; recovery plan; research work; tourism market; tourist behavior; tourist destination","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84955199233"

The alternative is to estimate the distribution of WTP directly. We apply both approaches to data on site choice in the Alps.

The ""MPC out of liquidity"" is largest for people starting near their limit, consistent with binding liquidity constraints. However, the MPC is significant even for people starting well below their limit, consistent with precautionary models. Nonetheless, there are other results that conventional models cannot easily explain, for example, why so many people are borrowing on their credit cards, and simultaneously holding low yielding assets.

The second generation of Internet-based applications enhances marketing efforts by allowing firms to implement innovative forms of communication and co-create content with their customers. Based on a survey of marketing managers, this article shows that firms face internal and external pressures to adopt a digital presence in social media platforms. Firms' digital marketing engagement can be categorized according to perceived benefits and digital marketing usage. To improve digital marketing engagement, marketers must focus on relationship-based interactions with their customers.

Design/methodology/approach: Keeping the TAM proposed by Davis as a theoretical basis, an extended TAM incorporating security- and privacy-related issues for internet banking adoption is conceptualized. The authors have incorporated various inhibitors of internet banking which restrict the use of internet banking adoption under ""perceived risk"", and also consider the role of the bank web site as a key determinant of perceived risk and of perceived ease of use in the context of internet banking services. Findings: The paper reveals that perceived risk has a negative impact on behavioral intention of internet banking adoption and trust has a negative impact on perceived risk. A well-designed web site was also found to be helpful in facilitating easier use and also minimizing perceived risk concerns regarding internet banking usage. Practical implications: Financial bank institutions should give attention to the inhibitors or perceived risk factors of internet banking adoption in order to retain existing customers as well as attract new consumers. The study also suggests that banks should build a web site with features to facilitate users' assessment of internet banking services and thus minimize the perceived risk and maximize the perceived ease of internet banking services. Web-based retailers depending on online payments would also be benefit by incorporating the elements of perceived risk and trust in their own web design and online services. Originality/value: In addition to the traditional construct of TAM, a new construct of perceived risk has been added.

An important question is how much of that collapse resulted from government-imposed restrictions versus people voluntarily choosing to stay home to avoid infection. This paper examines the drivers of the economic slowdown using cellular phone records data on customer visits to more than 2.25 million individual businesses across 110 different industries. Comparing consumer behavior over the crisis within the same commuting zones but across state and county boundaries with different policy regimes suggests that legal shutdown orders account for only a modest share of the massive changes to consumer behavior (and that tracking county-level policy conditions is significantly more accurate than using state-level policies alone). While overall consumer traffic fell by 60 percentage points, legal restrictions explain only 7 percentage points of this. Individual choices were far more important and seem tied to fears of infection. Traffic started dropping before the legal orders were in place; was highly influenced by the number of COVID deaths reported in the county; and showed a clear shift by consumers away from busier, more crowded stores toward smaller, less busy stores in the same industry. States that repealed their shutdown orders saw symmetric, modest recoveries in consumer visits, further supporting the small estimated effect of policy. Although the shutdown orders had little aggregate impact, they did have a significant effect in reallocating consumer visits away from “nonessential” to “essential” businesses and from restaurants and bars toward groceries and other food sellers. © 2020","Borders; Consumer activity; COVID; Economic activity; Essential business; Lockdown; Pandemic; Shelter in place; Sheltering orders; Shutdown; States","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85096706431"

This study extends the technology acceptance model (TAM) by introducing e-service quality dimensions, trust and enjoyment in the development of a theoretical model to study customers' repurchase intentions within the context of online shopping. Design/methodology/approach - Data collected from 360 PCHome online shopping customers provides strong support for the proposed research model. PLS (partial least squares, PLS-Graph version 3.0) is used to analyse the measurement and structural models. Findings - The study shows that trust, perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness and enjoyment are significant positive predictors of customers' repurchase intentions. Research limitations/implications - The data are collected from a single online shopping store - the generalisation of the model and findings to other online stores requires additional research. Our findings imply that the five dimensions of e-service quality are possibly among the most important antecedents of customers' trust in online vendors. Practical implications - Online vendors should ensure that they provide adequate utilitarian and hedonic value for customers instead of focusing on just one of these aspects in their web site development. Originality/value - Customer loyalty is critical to the online vendor's survival and success.

Although this research has the potential to offer insight into how CSR impacts individuals representing various stakeholder groups (e.g., consumers, shareholders), to date the term micro-CSR has generally been limited to describing research on employee responses to CSR initiatives. We argue that the taxonomic conscription of micro-CSR to employees alone exacerbates current friction within the field pertaining to the effects, utility, and importance of CSR. This review synthesizes the accruing research on employee-focused micro-CSR and summarizes current theories while addressing some of the concerns regarding CSR, particularly as it applies to other stakeholder groups. It repositions the study of CSR toward its ostensible ultimate purpose, reducing human suffering, and in doing so draws together theories and evidence focused on why CSR matters to employees and why the study of another stakeholder group - CSR recipients - is essential toward a valid understanding of the true micro-CSR experience (of employees, among others).

Consumers with higher organizational status prefer to give money versus time, but this preference is weaker for those with a highly self-important moral identity (Study 2), and the preference for giving time versus money is more likely to emerge when the moral self is primed and the time given has a moral purpose (Study 3). © 2007, American Marketing Association.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-34247113622"

Thus, relatively little is known about the cross-cultural applicability of these measures. Using Richins and Dawson's (1992) Material Values Scale (MVS) as an exemplar, this article focuses on the problems researchers are likely to encounter when employing domestic mixed-worded scales (i.e., scales that contain both positive- and reverse-worded items) in cross-cultural applications. Through an initial study among over 800 adults from the United States, Singapore, Thailand, Japan, and Korea, we show that the cross-cultural measurement equiv- alence and construct validity of the MVS is challenged by its mixed-worded Likert format. Through a second study among approximately 400 Americans and East Asians, we find that other mixed-worded scales produce similar problems and that the cross-cultural applicability of such scales may be enhanced by replacing items posed as statements with items framed as questions.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0037828092"

A second process (globalisation) is also initiated by intercultural contact and leads to cultural and individual change. Two long-held assumptions are that (i) these two processes induce more change among non-dominant peoples, and (ii) the eventual outcome will be the loss of distinctive cultural and behavioural features of non-dominant group members, leading to their absorption into a homogeneous society that resembles the original dominant group. The long-term outcome is thus believed to be one rather homogeneous global society, sharing beliefs, values, consumer preferences and social structures. In this paper these assumptions are challenged, employing an acculturation framework that posits highly variable cultural and psychological outcomes that follow from intergroup contact. In addition to the assimilation of non-dominant peoples into dominant societies (either within societies or internationally), this framework proposes that other outcomes are possible: integration results in the maintenance of existing cultures and behaviours while peoples engage in day-to-day interaction within an evolving civic framework; separation results in the cultural and psychological maintenance when groups and individuals avoid interaction as much as possible; and marginalisation results in cultural and psychological loss, particularly among non-dominant populations, along with their exclusion from full and equitable participation in the larger society. Examples of such variability are provided, using empirical studies of indigenous and diasporic peoples, immigrants, and nation states. It is concluded that, rather than assimilation and homogenisation resulting from intercultural contact, the more likely outcomes are either some forms of integration (exhibiting a high degree of cultural and psychological continuity and producing new social structures that incorporate interacting peoples), or separation (in the form of resistance and revitalisation of heritage cultures). © 2008.","Acculturation; Acculturation strategies; Globalisation; Homogenisation; Reaffirmation","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-47949103126"

The trend of automation technology being used in vehicles by the most important vehicle manufacturing industries is expected to move closer to high or fully Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) through technological advancements in sectors of robotics and artificial intelligence. Vehicles with autonomous driving capabilities are planning to be available on market, in full scale, in the next years. In the longer term substantial benefits are mainly expected for accessibility to transport, safety, traffic flow, emissions, fuel use and comfort. All these potential societal benefits will not be achieved unless AVs are accepted and used by a critical mass of people. Addressing these challenges, this paper: (a) proposes a technology acceptance modelling process by extending the original Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) to explain and predict consumers’ intensions towards AVs, (b) based on the proposed TAM-extended framework, a 30-question survey was conducted in order to investigate the factors influencing consumers’ intensions to use and accept AVs. Results show that the constructs of perceived usefulness, perceived ease to use, perceived trust and social influence, are all useful predictors of behavioral intentions to have or use AVs, with perceived usefulness having the strongest impact. The insights derived from this study could significantly contribute to ongoing research related to technology acceptance of AVs and are expected to allow automobile industries to improve their design and technology. © 2018","Autonomous driving; Consumers’ perceptions; Intelligent transport systems; Technology acceptance modelling; Trust in automation; Usage intentions","Automotive industry; Economic and social effects; Intelligent systems; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Traffic control; Autonomous driving; Autonomous Vehicles; Consumer perception; Intelligent transport; Intelligent transport system; Perceived usefulness; Technology acceptance model; Transport systems; Trust in automation; Usage intention; automobile; consumption behavior; modeling; perception; public attitude; robotics; Autonomous vehicles","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85052921001"

It is fast becoming a new market force and brand identifier and is now moving into the mainstream market, affecting and changing perception on how business should be conducted, including from a marketing point of view. The purpose of this paper is to test the applicability of the theory of reasoned action (TRA) in predicting the intention to choose halal product among Malaysian consumers. Design/methodology/approach – A structured questionnaire was used to elicit responses from consumers using a convenience sampling technique. A total of 485 responses were received. Needless to say, this study extends the applicability of the TRA to study halal product usage among consumers in Malaysia. Findings – The findings indicated that the TRA is a valid model in the prediction of the intention to choose halal products. Attitude (β=0.288, p<0.001) and subjective norm (β=0.814, p<0.001) were found to be positively related to intention, with subjective norm being the more influential predictor. Subjective norm was also positively related to the attitude (β=0.336, p<0.001) to choose halal products. Research limitations/implications – The study contains a limited number of measures in the model. Nevertheless, it provides new information on the emerging issue of halal products. Practical implications – The results will be primarily beneficial to restaurants, fast food restaurants and small and medium enterprises in Malaysia by offering an insight into the intentions of consumers to choose halal products.

Design/methodology/approach – Data were collected by a questionnaire administered over three days at a department store that generates the second largest turnover in Finland. A total of 364 shoppers completed the questionnaire. Findings – Empirical evidence supports our tripartite conceptualization of total customer value. In particular, social value is an independent construct. Further, social value varies by day-of-week, with a significant increase on Saturday (versus weekdays) when the store is more crowded, whereas no such differences in utilitarian and hedonic values were detected. Originality/value – The principal contribution is a tripartite conceptualization of total customer value that incorporates utilitarian, social and hedonic value dimensions in a department store shopping context. Individually these dimensions are all well rooted in streams of consumer behavior literature, albeit mostly at the product or brand, not the store, level. Increasing our understanding of these softer aspects of shopping, particularly the social dimension, is important because they represent possible differentiating factors in the highly competitive and often commoditized retail markets. © 2006, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Consumer behaviour; Department stores; Finland; Shopping; Social values","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-30644458347"

Primarily, we hope to reveal characteristics of existing studies investigating the health topics that consumers have discussed in social media, ascertaining the roles social media have played in consumers’ information-seeking processes and discussing the potential benefits and concerns of accessing consumer health information in social media. Methods: The Web of Science Core Collection database was searched for existing literature on consumer health information seeking in social media. The search returned 214 articles, of which 21 met the eligibility criteria following review of full-text documents. Conclusion: Between 2011 and 2016, twenty-one studies published explored various topics related to consumer information seeking in social media. These ranged from online discussions on specific diseases (e.g. diabetes) to public health concerns (e.g. pesticide residues). Consumers’ information needs vary depending on the health issues of interest. Benefits of health seeking on social media, in addition to filling a need for health information, include the social and emotional support health consumers gain from peer-to-peer interactions. These benefits, however, are tempered by concerns of information quality and authority and lead to decreased consumer engagement. © 2017 Health Libraries Group","consumer health information; health information needs; information-seeking behaviour; social media","Consumer Health Information; Humans; Information Seeking Behavior; Internet; Social Media; consumer health information; human; information seeking; Internet; procedures; social media; standards; utilization","Review","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85031668582"

Although a firm's survival depends much on repeated use, whether or not a firm survives is also influenced by a variety of other behavioral outcomes that include, but are not limited to, word-of-mouth, willingness to pay, and inattentiveness to alternatives. Whereas post-adoption research has recently paid attention to repeated use, the information systems field still lacks a systematic investiation into other behavioral outcomes that transcend mere usage. In an attempt to extend the horizons of post-adoption research, we develop and test a model that explains post-adoption behaviors in the context of online services. First, drawing on a dual model of relationship maintenance in consumer behavior research, we propose a conceptual frame-work to study and explain online consumer behavior. In particular, our model predicts that two contrasting mechanisms, that is, dedication and constraint, are the main drivers of post-adoption phenomena (i.e., consumers' post-adoption reactions to online services - beliefs, attitudes, intentions, and behaviors). We empirically test the proposed dual model through the use of data collected from 510 users of online portals. The results of structural equation modeling analysis indicate that, as expected, the dedication- and constraint-based mechanisms simultaneously, yet differentially, determine online consumer behavior. In general, our findings suggest that it is essential in examining the complex nature of post-adoption phenomena to take into account the interplay of the dedication- and constraint-based mechanisms.","Loyalty; Online consumer behavior; Post-adoption behavior; Service-specific investments; Structural equation modeling; Survey research; Switching costs","Electronic commerce; Information use; Loyalty; Online consumer behavior; Post-adoption behavior; Specific investment; Structural equation modeling; Survey research; Switching costs; Consumer behavior","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-60649108798"

In this paper, 'sufficiency' is proposed as a driver of business model innovation for sustainability. Sufficiency-driven business models seek to moderate overall resource consumption by curbing demand through education and consumer engagement, making products that last longer and avoiding built-in obsolescence, focusing on satisfying 'needs' rather than promoting 'wants' and fast-fashion, conscious sales and marketing techniques, new revenue models, or innovative technology solutions. This paper uses a case study approach to investigate how companies might use sufficiency as a driver for innovation and asserts that there can be a good business case for sufficiency.

Predictions are then tested regarding relationships between private label attitude and (1) latent perceptual and sales promotion constructs, and (2) purchase behaviors measured in a field setting. The measure is positively related to value consciousness, deal proneness, and smart-shopper self-perceptions, and negatively related to the propensity to be brand loyal and hold price-quality perceptions. Predictive validity of the private label measure is supported by a positive relationship with private label purchases from a grocery store shopping trip. Despite a positive relationship between the latent constructs of private label attitude and deal proneness, the consumer segment that allocated a high percentage of total purchases to private label products made fewer purchases on sale or with a coupon.

The purpose of this study is to examine the determinants of green curtailment behaviors and consumer adoption of innovations marketed as green (eco-innovations), and to analyze factors explaining these two types of green behaviors. Design/methodology/approach: The results from a survey on adopters and non-adopters (n=1,832) of alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) are reported. Regression analysis on willingness to curtail car use and willingness to adopt a so-called environmentally friendly car are used to identify significant determinants across the behavioral categories. Findings: The results show that values, beliefs, norms, and habit strength determine willingness to curtail and willingness for eco-innovation adoption. Personal norms have a strong positive influence on willingness for the behaviors and habit strength has a negative influence. The other determinants have varying influence depending on type of behavior. Research limitations/implications: A limitation of this study concerns the focus on only one eco-innovation. However, since the adoption of AFVs is a high involvement behavior, the results carry implications for other high involvement products as well. Practical implications: Attitudinal factors and habits in combination prove to be effective determinants for curtailment behaviors and willingness to adopt eco-innovations. In addition, previous adoption is found to be a strong determinant of future willingness to adopt. Originality/value: The contribution of the paper is the two-sided approach on green consumer behavior and the result that values, beliefs and norms not only predict low involvement post-purchase behaviors but also adoption of high involvement eco-innovations. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Automotive fuels; Consumer behaviour; Ecology; Sweden","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-77954228460"

Our baseline model involves rational consumers with constant valuations for the goods being sold and a monopoly merchant who can commit to a pricing policy. Applying results from the prior literature, we show that although it is feasible to price so as to distinguish high-value and low-value consumers, the merchant will never find it optimal to do so. We then consider various generalizations of this model, such as allowing the seller to offer enhanced services to previous customers, making the merchant unable to commit to a pricing policy, and allowing competition in the marketplace. In these cases we show that sellers will, in general, find it profitable to condition prices on purchase history. © 2005 INFORMS.","Internet marketing; Personalized marketing; Price discrimination; Privacy; Targeting","","Review","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-14744280530"

Substitution effects make demand curves slope down, but income effects can increase or decrease the slope, and can sometimes overwhelm the substitution effect. We decompose changes in the worldwide growth rate into two effects (integration and redundancy) that unambiguously slow down growth, and a third effect (allocation) that can either speed it up or slow it down. We study two types of trade restrictions to illustrate the use of this decomposition. The First is across the board restrictions on traded goods in an otherwise perfect market. The second is selective protection of knowledge-intensive goods in a world with imperfect intellectual property rights. In both examples, we show that for trade between similar regions such as Europe and North America, the first two effects dominate; starting from free trade, restrictions unambiguously reduce worldwide growth. © 1991.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-44949281574"

One outcome has been the proliferation of a variety of pricing formats, and considerable debate among academics and practitioners about how these formats affect consumers' store choice behavior. This paper advances the idea that consumer shopping behavior (as defined by average size of the shopping basket and the frequency of store visits) is an important determinant of the store choice decision when stores offer different price formats. A recent Wall Street Journal article that summarized the result of Bruno's management switching the chain from EDLP to HILO illustrates the importance of this issue: ""The company's price-conscious customers, used to shopping for a fixed basket of goods, stayed away in droves."" Thus, the audience for this paper includes practitioners and academics who wish to understand store choices or predict how a change in price format might affect store profitability and the mix of clientele that shop there. This paper attempts to understand the relationship between grocery shopping behavior, retail price format, and store choice by posing and answering the following questions. First, after controlling for other factors (e.g., distance to the store, prior experience in the store, advertised specials), do consumer expectations about prices for a basket of grocery products (""expected basket attractiveness"") influence the store choice decision? This is a fairly straightforward test of the effect of price expectations on store choice. Second, are different pricing formats (EDLP or HILO) more or less attractive to different types of shoppers? To adequately an"" swer the second question, we must link consumers' category purchase decisions, which collectively define the market basket, and the store choice decision. We study the research questions using two complementary approaches. First, we develop a stylized theory of consumer shopping behavior under price uncertainty. The principal features and results from the stylized model can be summarized as follows. Shoppers are defined (in a relative sense) as either large or small basket shoppers. Thus, we abstract from the vicissitudes of individual shopping trips and focus on meaningful differences across shoppers in terms of the expected basket size per trip. The shoppers make category purchase incidence decisions and can choose to shop in either an EDLP or a HILO store. Large basket shoppers are shoppers who have a relatively high probability of purchase for any given category, and as such they are more captive to prices across many different categories. The first two propositions summarize the price responsiveness of shoppers. In particular, the large basket shoppers are less responsive to price in their individual category purchase incidence decisions; this makes them more responsive to the expected basket price in their store choice decisions. This key structural implication of the model highlights an asymmetry between response at the category level and response at the store level. The result is quite intuitive; a (large basket) shopper with less ability to respond to prices in individual product categories will be more sensitive to the expected cost of the overall portfolio (the market basket) when choosing a store. The final proposition derives the price at which a given shopper will be indifferent between an EDLP and a HILO store. The key insight is that as a shopper increases his or her tendency to become a large basket shopper, the EDLP store can increase its (constant) price closer and closer to the average price in the HILO store. Conversely, as the shopper becomes more of small basket shopper, the EDLP store must lower its price closer to the deal price in the HILO store. Thus, we have the interesting result that small basket shoppers prefer HILO stores, even at higher average prices. The empirical testing mirrors the development of the consumer theory. We test the implications of the propositions using a market basket scanner panel database. The database includes two years of shopping data for 1,042 households in two separate market areas. We first use household-level grocery expenditures to model the probability that a household is a large or small basket shopper. Subsequently, we estimate purchase incidence and store choice models. We find that after controlling for important factors such as household distance to the store, previous experience in the store, and advertised specials, price expectations for the basket influence store choice. Furthermore, EDLP stores get a greater than expected share of business from large basket shoppers; HILO stores get a greater than expected share from small basket shoppers. Consistent with the implications of the propositions, large basket shoppers are relatively price inelastic in their category purchase incidence decisions and price elastic in their store choice decisions.","Choice models; Market basket; Pricing; Shopping behavior","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0032220722"

But still there is a huge gap in favour of women when it comes to life expectancy at birth. People's health information behaviour, that is how people seek, obtain, evaluate, categorize and use relevant health-related information to perform desired health behaviours, is a critical prerequisite to appropriate and consistent performances of these behaviours. With respect to gender, it has been noted that men often are unwilling and lack the motivation to engage with health-related information. The purpose of this study was to investigate how gender affects health information behaviour in the Finnish population aged 18-65 years. The survey data were collected via a questionnaire which was posted to a representative cross section consisting of 1500 Finnish citizens. The statistical analysis consists of ANOVA F-tests and Fisher's exact tests. The results show that women were more interested in and reported much more active seeking of health-related information, paid more attention to potential worldwide pandemics and were much more attentive as to how the goods they purchase in everyday life affect their health than men did. Women also reported receiving far more informal health-related information from close family members, other kin and friends/workmates than men did. Thus, to succeed in public health promotion and interventions the measures taken should be much more sensitive to the gender gap in health information behaviour. © 2013 The Author (2013).","consumer health information; health awareness; health information seeking; Northern Europe","Adolescent; Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Consumer Health Information; Female; Finland; Global Health; Health Behavior; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Motivation; Sex Factors; Young Adult; adolescent; adult; age; aged; consumer health information; female; Finland; health; health behavior; human; male; middle aged; motivation; procedures; sex difference; young adult","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84940652748"

This study attempts to shift some of that focus to individual-level variables that may impact health risk information seeking across contexts. To locate these variables, the researcher posits an integrated model, the Planned Risk Information Seeking Model (PRISM). The model, which treats risk information seeking as a deliberate (planned) behavior, maps variables found in the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB; Ajzen, 1991) and the Risk Information Seeking and Processing Model (RISP; Griffin, Dunwoody, & Neuwirth, 1999), and posits linkages among those variables. This effort is further informed by Kahlor's (2007) Augmented RISP, the Theory of Motivated Information Management (Afifi & Weiner, 2004), the Comprehensive Model of Information Seeking (Johnson & Meischke, 1993), the Health Information Acquisition Model (Freimuth, Stein, & Kean, 1989), and the Extended Parallel Processing Model (Witte, 1998).

In this study, under the theoretical guidelines of the Stimuli-Organism-Response model and the Competitive Arousal model, we investigate how in the panic situation created by the pandemic, external stimuli such as Limited Quantity Scarcity (LQS) and Limited Time Scarcity (LTS) affect the emotional arousal among people, which in turn influences consumers’ impulsive and obsessive buying behaviors. This study is conducted in a multi-country setting including the U.S., China, India, and Pakistan. Online surveys were conducted during the peak time of pandemic. Our findings show that LQS and LTS significantly increase perceived arousal in consumers, which further leads to more impulsive and obsessive buying. In addition, our results also reveal that excessive social media use intensifies the relationship between scarcity messages and perceived arousal whereas the urge to buy impulsively moderates the relationship between perceived arousal and behavioral outcomes in all selected countries except for India.

It posits that anthropomorphized brands trigger people's goals for a successful social interaction, resulting in behavior that is assimilative or contrastive to the brand's image. Three studies show that consumers are more likely to assimilate behavior associated with anthropomorphized partner brands that they like, consistent with the goal of drawing in the liked coproducer, and servant brands that they dislike, consistent with the goal of pushing the disliked would-be helper away by signaling self-sufficiency. Results also show a contrastive behavior when primed with disliked partner brands and liked servant brands. These effects are observed in contexts unrelated to the brand prime. For example, priming Kellogg's, a liked partner brand associated with healthfulness, led to greater willingness to take the stairs than the elevator in a purportedly unrelated study.

The purpose is to understand better the capacity of these theories of behavioural response to predict and explain observed consumer behaviour. The authors argue that the evaluation of such models cannot proceed in abstract contexts. The development, implementation and maintenance of a kerbside recycling programme by the Cotswold District Council in the UK provided an opportunity to examine the cognition–behaviour links proposed by these theories. Unlike mostother tests of these models, the authors' research employs independent measures of behaviour as well as behavioural intention and other alleged cognitive precursors of behaviour. The results indicate that cognitive variables, notably intention, fail topredict actual behaviour and that a more elaborate integrated model of recycling is required in order to accomplish this. The research suggests that, at least in the context in which the investigation was undertaken, the intention–behaviour hypothesis, which lies at the heart of so much psychological and marketing theorizing, must be abandoned. © 2002, SAGE.

This paper examines relationships between consumer posting behavior and marketing variables-such as product price and quality-and explores how these relationships evolve as the Internet and consumer review websites attract more universal acceptance. Based on automobile-model data from several leading online consumer review sources that were collected in 2001 and 2008, this study demonstrates that the relationships between marketing variables and consumer online-posting behavior are different at the early and mature stages of Internet usage. For instance, in the early stage of consumer Internet usage, price is negatively correlated with the propensity to post a review. As consumer Internet usage becomes prevalent, however, the relationship between price and the number of online consumer reviews shifts to a U-shape. In contrast, in the early years, price has a U-shaped relationship with overall consumer rating, but this correlation between price and overall rating becomes less significant in the later period. Such differences at the two different stages of Internet usage can be driven by different groups of consumers with different motivations for online review posting. © 2011 Direct Marketing Educational Foundation, Inc.","Consumer reviews; Online community; Social media; Word-of-mouth","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-79955043132"

The five factors examined in this study are perceived usefulness (PU), perceived ease-of-use (PEOU), social influence (SI), perceived cost and trust. Design/methodology/approach - The study sample consists of 222 respondents with a response rate of 84.09 per cent. Data were analyzed by employing correlation and multiple regression analysis. Findings - The findings revealed that PU, SI, perceived financial cost and trust are positively associated with consumer IU m-commerce in Malaysia. In addition, PEOU and trust were found to have an insignificant effect on consumer IU m-commerce in Malaysia. Research limitations/implications - The generalizability of the findings is limited as the study focuses only on Malaysia. Practical implications - Based on the findings, companies involved in m-commerce should focus on improving the usefulness of the system, trust (i.e. security and privacy protection) and reducing the cost of m-commerce services to improve the adoption of m-commerce. Originality/value - The findings made a contribution in terms of allowing us to understand the factors that can contribute to the adoption of mobile commerce. This study successfully extend the TAM model in the context of mobile commerce by incorporating one trust-based construct (trust), one behavioural control construct (perceived financial cost) and one subjective norm construct (SI). This extended TAM model provides a greater understanding of user acceptance of mobile commerce in Malaysia. © 2009 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

We offer an individual-level probability model that allows for different forms of customer heterogeneity in a very flexible manner. Specifically, we decompose an individual's conversion behavior into two components: one for accumulating visit effects and another for purchasing threshold effects. Each component is allowed to vary across households as well as over time. Visit effects capture the notion that store visits can play different roles in the purchasing process. For example, some visits are motivated by planned purchases, while others are associated with hedonic browsing (akin to window shopping); our model is able to accommodate these (and several other) types of visit-purchase relationships in a logical, parsimonious manner. The purchasing threshold captures the psychological resistance to online purchasing that may grow or shrink as a customer gains more experience with the purchasing process at a given website. We test different versions of the model that vary in the complexity of these two key components and also compare our general framework with popular alternatives such as logistic regression. We find that the proposed model offers excellent statistical properties, including its performance in a holdout validation sample, and also provides useful managerial diagnostics about the patterns underlying online buyer behavior.","Buyer behavior; E-commerce; Online purchasing conversion; Stochastic models","Behavioral research; Consumer products; Managers; Mathematical models; Planning; Random processes; Websites; Buyer behavior; Online purchasing conversion; Stochastic models; Electronic commerce","Review","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-1842783295"

Our initial inquiry into this area finds that young adults reared in disrupted families are more materialistic and exhibit higher levels of compulsive consumption than young adults reared in intact families. Furthermore, we show that the relationship between family structure and compulsive consumption is partially mediated by both the amount of resources available within the family and the degree of family stress. We also find that the impact of family disruption on family stress is moderated by socioeconomic status.

The attitude ranks high in merit for predicting the consumer's green hotel visit intention. Further, the relative importance of moral reflectiveness vis-à-vis conscientiousness has been observed more in predicting green hotel visit intention, however, vice versa is true while constituting attitude of consumers specific to green hotel choice intention.

This study contributes to existing research by reviewing the literature on the impact of economic policy uncertainty on corporations and economies worldwide. We show the importance of measuring and tracking uncertainty by highlighting its influence on financial decisions. We examine the growing number of studies that use the economic policy uncertainty index (EPU) of Baker, Bloom, and Davis (2016) as a key factor in measuring uncertainty. We then review the impact of EPU on financial markets, macro and micro level, stock markets, corporate behavior, and risk management. Then, we document the asymmetric policy responses of economic uncertainty. Overall, policy uncertainty has a significant impact on firm financial policies as well as on consumer spending. Specifically, corporations act more conservatively during times of high uncertainty, thereby slowing investments in production and employment.

This research also investigated cultural domination on citizens' behavioural perception. The data for this study was collected among citizens from three countries: USA, Canada, and Bangladesh. The findings suggest that the UTAUT model could partially shape technology artefact behaviour and the extended UTAUT must consider specific determinants relevant to cognitive, affective, and conative or behavioural aspects of citizens. The model helps policy-makers to develop mobile healthcare service system that will be better accepted. The finding also suggests that this mobile service system should reflect a country's cultural traits.

However, there have been concerns that the factors which motivate consumers to purchase organic foods are not properly known. This study investigated students' behavioural intentions with regard to purchasing organic food in Iran. The Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) was used for the investigation, as it is one of the most widely used theories for investigating the relationship between attitude and action. Results indicated that the students' attitude was the main predictor of their intention to purchase organic foods. Interestingly, this research showed that both perceived behavioural control and subjective norms were not significant predictors of intention. Furthermore, adding moral norm and self-identity as the additional constructs to the TPB significantly increased the explanatory power of the standard model. From the practical point of view, the present study provides a justification for using attitude, self-identity and moral norm dimensions in policy and decision making that intend to encourage students to purchase organic foods. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Iran; Moral norm; Purchase organic food; Self-identity; Theory of Planned Behaviour","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Behavioral research; Decision making; Students; Iran; Moral norm; Organic foods; Self-identity; Theory of planned behaviour; Sales","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84942991072"

This paper argues that rather than being a reflection of inherent complexities in such food systems, the continued uncertainties about the fundamental nature and development of AFNs are, at least in part, a function of how AFNs are often conceptualised and investigated, which ultimately impedes progress in knowledge of such systems. After introducing the main theoretical perspectives of research in the field, and setting out what is known currently about AFNs and their characteristics, the paper goes on to articulate four features of AFN research which, it is argued, give rise to problems in this field. In particular, the paper identifies inconsistent use of concepts and terms, conflation of the structural characteristics of food systems with desired outcomes and/or actor behaviours, insufficient acknowledgement of the problems of marketplace trading, and a continued lack of a consumer perspective. The paper concludes with a set of recommendations for future research into AFNs that seeks to break current boundaries and encourage greater progress in knowledge in this field. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Alternative food networks; Critique; Food chain localisation; Socio-economic analysis","food chain; food supply; knowledge; socioeconomic conditions; uncertainty analysis","Review","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-82855178802"

The recent adoption of online communication by many consumers has facilitated a fundamental change to the structure of many WOM interactions by exposing consumers to electronic WOM (eWOM) from virtual strangers. The current study seeks to uncover whether traditional findings on social ties and WOM communication hold for eWOM information. Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected from 482 college students with varying levels of expertise with eWOM forums, specifically RateMyProfessors.com in the USA. Participants completed a 20-question survey related to university professor and class choice. Findings - The study finds that students seeking information on which professor to take weight the information they obtain from eWOM forums to be equally influential in their decision as their own primary experience with the professor. Furthermore, the information gained from the eWOM forum is more influential in their decision than speaking with friends in person (WOM). While existing research suggests that strong tie referral sources are more influential than weak tie information sources on decision making, this research finds that some weak tie information sources are rated as more influential. Research limitations/ implications - A limitation of the study is the focus on one eWOM forum, RateMyProfessors.com. Future research would benefit from expanding the number and type of eWOM forums. Originality/value - While the emergence of the Internet and social networking has spawned an interest in the overall study of eWOM, this study is the first to evaluate eWOM in the context of tie strength, homophily and decision making. The study also investigates whether existing theories of interpersonal communication hold in an online context. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Consumer behaviour; Electronic commerce; Internet; Interpersonal communications","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-58449129405"

Trust is a vitally important topic in influencer and tourism marketing and is responsible for creating and maintaining successful long-term relationships between organizations and consumers. This study uses customer journey theory to explain the impact of SMI trust on customer travel decision-making and focuses on evaluating the role of customer journey constructs (including desire, information search, evaluating alternatives, purchase decisions, satisfaction and experience sharing) in mediating the interrelation between SMI trust and the dimensions of customer journeys. Using Smart PLS to analyze the data collected, the results indicate that consumer trust in SMIs has a positive effect on each phase of travel decision-making. Moreover, each step of the decision-making journey mediates the trust effect on the next step, having a spillover effect on the whole journey, implying continuous SMI input. Tourism marketers are advised to use SMIs to increase and stimulate the desire to travel as clearly, a means by which consumers search for information about their next journey. Besides SMIs as a marketing tool, their trustworthiness serves as a highly important aspect to successfully influence tourists’ destination decision making. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","customer journey; eWOM; influencer Marketing (IM); Social media (SM); social media influencer (SMI); travel decision; trust","consumption behavior; decision making; marketing; social media; spillover effect; tourist destination","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85102593381"

But addressing consumption is also vital in reducing the impact of society on its environment. The concept of sustainable consumption is a response to this. But the debates about sustainable consumption can only really be understood in the context of much wider and deeper debates about consumption and about consumer behavior itself. This article explores some of these wider debates. In particular, it draws attention to a fundamental disagreement that runs through the literature on consumption and haunts the debate on sustainable consumption: the question of whether, or to what extent, consumption can be taken as ""good for us."" Some approaches assume that increasing consumption is more or less synonymous with improved well-being: the more we consume the better off we are. Others argue, just as vehemently, that the scale of consumption in modern society is both environmentally and psychologically damaging, and that we could reduce consumption significantly without threatening the quality of our lives. This second viewpoint suggests that a kind of ""double dividend"" is inherent in sustainable consumption: the ability to live better by consuming less and reduce our impact on the environment in the process. In the final analysis, this article argues, such ""win-win"" solutions may exist but will require a concerted societal effort to realize. © 2005 by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Yale University.","Consumer behavior; Consumer choice; Consumer culture; Evolutionary psychology; Industrial ecology; Symbolic interactionism","Environmental impact; Industrial management; Psychophysiology; Industrial ecology; Pschologically damaging; Sustainable consumption; consumer-resource interaction; consumption behavior; quality of life; sustainability; Ecology","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-12444292821"

This research considers shopping a dynamic process that consists of search and purchase phases, in which the total utility of shopping process is determined by the perceived consumer utility toward channel use, which is mainly driven by consumer characteristics. The authors (1) segment consumers on the basis of their attitudes toward multiple channels as search and purchase alternatives; (2) investigate the association among psychological, economic, and sociodemographic covariates and segment membership; and (3) explore how multichannel behavior might differ across different product categories. Using survey data from 364 Dutch consumers and Latent-Class Analyse, they identify three segments - multichannel enthusiasts, uninvolved shoppers, and store-focused consumers - and covariates, such as shopping enjoyment, loyalty, and innovativeness that predict segment membership. The category-specific analysis suggests that overall segment descriptions apply generally to a variety of categories, though some differences exist, including the impact of covariates, across categories.

Design/methodology/approach - An exploratory factor analysis used a sample from undergraduate student respondents. Then, a more representative sample of hotel guests was used, in a second-order confirmatory factor analysis. Findings - The dominant dimensions of SQ construct in the service factory were found to be: Tangibles, Recovery, Responsiveness, and Knowledge. Further results indicate that, although the direct effect of SQ on BI is significant, the indirect effect (with SAT playing a mediating role) is a stronger driver for BI in the context of the service factory. Research limitations/implications - A notable limitation is that the present study focuses only on the service factory and uses only one industry (lodging) to illustrate the findings. Future research should examine other service categories. Practical implications - Service managers are recommended to devise operations and marketing strategies that focus on the dominant SQ dimensions in order to enhance SAT and, in turn, foster positive BI. Originality/value - This study demonstrates that SQ, SAT and BI and their interrelationships may be typology-specific. If this is true, two or more industries (e.g. airlines and lodging) may exhibit similar relationship characteristics with regard to these constructs if they belong to the same service category.

This paper pits neoclassical theory against prospect theory by investigating data drawn from more than 375 subjects actively participating in a well-functioning marketplace. The pattern of results suggests that prospect theory adequately organizes behavior among inexperienced consumers, but consumers with intense market experience behave largely in accordance with neoclassical predictions. Moreover, the data are consistent with the notion that consumers learn to overcome the endowment effect in situations beyond specific problems they have previously encountered. This ""transference of behavior"" across domains has important implications in both a positive and normative sense.","Endowment effect; Experience; Field experiment","Commerce; Economics; Human engineering; Probability distributions; Regression analysis; Statistical tests; Endowment effect; Neoclassical theory; Prospect theory; Marketing","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-1642346858"

One hundred and eighty-eight new venture firms in the computer and communications equipment manufacturing industries are classified according to the percentage of their sales in the international market. Ventures with no sales derived from international activities are considered ""domestic"" new ventures, and ventures with sales from international activities comprising greater than 5% of total sales are considered ""international"" new ventures. The strategy and industry structure profiles of international new ventures are significantly different from domestic new ventures. The internationals pursue much broader market-based strategies, seeking a strategy of broad market coverage through developing and controlling numerous distribution channels, serving numerous customers in diverse market segments, and developing high market or product visibility. The internationals also emphasize a more aggressive entry strategy, building on outside financial and production resources to enter numerous geographical markets on a large scale. Securing patent technology is also an important component of their strategy. This suggests that the internationals compete by entering the industry on a large scale, seeking to penetrate multiple markets, with the recognition that external resources are necessary to support such an entry. Whereas both the domestics and the internationals characterize domestic competition as being relatively intense, the international new ventures compete in industries with higher levels of international competition. It is not clear from this research whether the new venture selects an industry with a high degree of international competition and therefore responds with an international orientation or, because the new venture has an international orientation, it perceives or recognizes a higher degree of international competition. Another industry structure difference is the internationals' perceived higher degree of restrictiveness due to government regulation. It is unclear whether this restrictiveness motivates new ventures to seek less-regulated international environments or if it indicates that when competing internationally, the new venture is confronted with increased regulatory requirements. Domestic new ventures are distinguished by their emphasis on a production expansion strategy and customer specialization strategy. The production specialization strategy consists of focusing on limited geographical markets, maintaining excess capacity, and pursuing forward integration. The customer specialization strategy incorporates the production of a specialty product that is purchased infrequently. Thus, for both of the domestic strategies, a consistent ""closeness"" between the producer and consumer is implied. This may be an important basis underlining the new venture's decision to compete in an exclusive domestic context. This study offers initial support for the notion of international entrepreneurship by its findings that there are significant differences between new venture firms competing domestically and new ventures choosing to also enter international markets. © 1989.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0001702903"

Drawing from the literature on trust, we developed a model of how trust-building strategies could affect trust and the consequences of trust. We investigated two trust-building strategies: portal association (based on reputation categorization and trust transference) and satisfied customer endorsements (based on unit grouping, reputation categorization, and trust transference). A series of two studies was conducted at a large public university in Hong Kong. The first study employed a laboratory experiment to test the model in an online bookstore environment, using a real task that involves actual book purchases. Of the two strategies investigated, satisfied customer endorsement by similar peers, but not portal association, was found to increase consumers' trusting beliefs about the store. This, in turn, positively influenced consumers' attitudes toward the store and their willingness to buy from the store, which ultimately led to actual buying behaviors. To gather further insights on the two Web strategies investigated, a second study was conducted using a questionnaire survey approach. Overall, the findings corroborated those in the first study. Specifically, it shows that endorsements by similar (local, nonforeign) peers, but not by dissimilar (foreign) peers, were effective means of developing trust among first-time visitors to online stores. © 2006 M.E.

In four experiments, we tested the hypothesis that social exclusion causes people to spend and consume strategically in the service of affiliation. Relative to controls, excluded participants were more likely to buy a product symbolic of group membership (but not practical or self-gift items), tailor their spending preferences to the preferences of an interaction partner, spend money on an unappealing food item favored by a peer, and report being willing to try an illegal drug, but only when doing so boosted their chances of commencing social connections.

We propose that individuals overweight inflation experienced during their lifetimes. This approach modifies existing adaptive learning models to allow for age-dependent updating of expectations in response to inflation surprises. Young individuals update their expectations more strongly than older individuals since recent experiences account for a greater share of their accumulated lifetime history. We find support for these predictions using 57 years of microdata on inflation expectations from the Reuters/Michigan Survey of Consumers. Differences in experiences strongly predict differences in expectations, including the substantial disagreement between young and old individuals in periods of highly volatile inflation, such as the 1970s.

In other words, Internet banking, although proven to be a successful innovation, has still not become adopted by the laggards, and hence, has not met all the expectations of banks. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to identify the reasons for consumer resistance to Internet banking. The special interest is to explore resistance among those bank customers who already have valid contracts for Internet banking but prefer to pay their bills via ATM. The objective is to identify those characteristics generating resistance to Internet banking and their connections to values of individuals. In order to achieve the objective, 30 Finnish bank customers were interviewed in-depth using the means-end approach and the laddering interviewing technique. The findings indicate both functional and psychological barriers arising from service-, channel-, consumer- and communication-related means-end chains inhibiting Internet banking adoption. The contribution of the paper lies in achieving a more profound understanding of consumer resistance to Internet banking, and further, in offering suggestions and practical advice for service providers' decision-making. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Argues that such an approach helps uncover hitherto neglected effects on retention and, in the process, unveils more cost effective ways of retaining customers. Drawing on this framework develops several hypotheses regarding the main and interaction effects of customer satisfaction, trust and switching barriers on retention. Tests these hypotheses on data from a large-scale mail survey of fixed line telephone users in the UK, finding that both customer satisfaction and trust have strong positive effects on customer retention. Contrary to some assertions in the literature, however, finds that the effect of trust on retention is weaker than that of satisfaction. Nevertheless, the interaction between trust and satisfaction also has a significant effect on retention, indicating that building both customer satisfaction and trust is a superior strategy to a focus on satisfaction alone. Qualitative evidence from the survey offers further support for this finding. Even a ""satisfying"" service recovery process might be inadequate to prevent loss of trust, with significant implications for future consumer behaviour. Finally, the results show that switching barriers have both a significant positive effect on customer retention as well as a moderating effect on the relationship between satisfaction and retention. While service providers may be able to retain even dissatisfied customers who perceive high switching barriers, argues that ideally, firms should aim at a combined strategy that makes switching barriers act as a complement to satisfaction.","Customer retention; Purchasing; Services; Trust","","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0042740441"

Findings are based on analyses of semistructured interviews with 80 older consumers, complemented by depth interviews with seven informants. Cherished possessions and their disposition play a significant role in older consumers' reminiscence and life review. Concerns about disposition of special possessions involve strong and ambivalent emotions. Older consumers voice concern over avoiding intrafamilial conflict, reducing uncertainty, and exercising control over the future life of special possessions. We emphasize the storied nature of the meanings consumers attach to their cherished possessions and the way in which these storied meanings are bundled with life review and disposition concerns. Many older consumers attempt to control meanings transferred with cherished possessions. They seek to pass on personal and familial legacies, achieve symbolic immortality, insure a good home for special objects, and/or influence the future lives of others. We show that there is a porous boundary between ownership and disposition of cherished possessions. And to our knowledge this is the first research to identify tactics and heuristics employed to select recipients for special possessions, time transfers, and effect these transfers. We suggest that future research could explore individual differences in disposition behaviors, the use of possessions by older consumers as external mnemonic props, disposition decision theory, cultural differences in disposition behaviors, or the role of special possessions in the creation of familial legacies.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0034258483"

However, the various motives behind the usage of different FDAs have not been addressed. The current study worked to fill this gap by developing a psychometrically valid and reliable instrument that measures different uses and gratifications (U&G) behind the use of FDAs. Additionally, the association between different U&Gs and intentions to use FDAs were investigated. This study utilized a mixed-method research approach consisting of open-ended essays (qualitative) with 125 FDA users and an online cross-sectional survey with 395 FDA users. The study applied U&G theory and found eight main gratifications behind the use of FDA, namely, convenience, societal pressure, customer experience, delivery experience, search of restaurants, quality control, listing, and ease-of-use. The results suggest that customer experience, search of restaurants, ease-of-use and listing were the significant antecedents of intentions to use FDAs. The study concludes with various implications and recommendations for future research on FDAs. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Food delivery applications (FDAs); Intention to use; Scale development; Structural equation modelling (SEM); Uses and gratifications (U&G) theory","consumption behavior; food consumption; measurement method; modeling; retailing; survey method","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85067688310"

Design/methodology/approach - This study used content analysis method to identify and describe social responsibility (SR) patterns in web sites, annual reports and corporate social responsibility (CSR) reports for the top ten hotel companies as listed in Hotels magazine. Findings - The findings reveal that 80 percent of the hotel companies analyzed reported socially responsible activities relating to some form of charitable donations. A diversity policy was reported by 60 percent of the hotel companies, while 40 percent provided some mention of SR in their vision or mission statements. Some companies were highly focused on providing a balanced approach to SR while other hotel companies were less focused in their efforts. The areas of SR that seemed to be lacking with regards to reporting were environmental, and vision and values. Research limitations/implications - Future studies should collect data from hospitality organizations and potential shareholders via interviews and surveys. Practical implications - With rising consumer awareness regarding corporate responsibility (CR), it is important for the industry to begin profiling their efforts at SR as part of their overall corporate and business strategies. Originality/value - This is one of the first research papers looking at CSR in the hospitality industry. It provides some practical implications about reporting of socially responsible activities for hospitality organizations. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Citizenship; Corporate social responsibility; Economic sustainability; Hotels","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-34547679516"

In general, student perceptions of sustainable development have been under-researched. This research sought to go some way towards filling the gap by providing insights for those working in the field of education for sustainable development (ESD) in higher education. Design/methodology/approach - The survey was administrated in autumn 2005 by the Centre for Sustainable Futures at the University of Plymouth. The closed-category statements were analyzed in terms of frequencies and percentages. A comprehensive set of cross tabulations and χ2 tests were also conducted using SPSS. Responses to open-ended questions were coded and categorized according to emerging themes. Findings - Key findings include, first, that a majority of student respondents think sustainability is ""a good thing"" their positive response not particularly correlating with their degree of familiarity with either of the concepts of sustainable development or sustainability. Second, students strongly associate the concepts of sustainable development and sustainability with their environmental as against economic and social aspects. Third, in terms of personal change for a sustainable lifestyle, ""light green"" actions addressing responsibility as consumers such as changing purchasing habits, recycling, and saving energy and/or water were most frequently articulated. Fourth, respondents harbour mixed feelings regarding the future of society in the face of sustainability-oriented challenges. Originality/value - The paper highlights the importance of ESD curriculum development that more explicitly addresses the interconnectedness of different aspects of sustainable development and which also employs pedagogies that help students to take action towards realizing their preferred futures. It also suggests future study directed towards identifying various means of facilitating students' pro-sustainability behaviours. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Change management; Education; Learning; Perception; Students; Sustainable development","","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-34547898849"

First, why don't sellers voluntarily disclose through a process of ""unraveling"" and, given the lack of unraveling, is it desirable to mandate seller disclosure? Second, when we rely on certifiers to act as the intermediary of quality disclosure, do certifiers necessarily report unbiased and accurate information? We further review empirical evidence on these issues, with a particular focus on healthcare, education, and finance. The empirical review covers quality measurement, the effect of third-party disclosure on consumer choice and seller behavior, as well as the economics of certifiers.","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-79952161046"

This activity-based model of activity-travel behavior is derived from theories of choice heuristics that consumers apply when making decisions in complex environments. The model, one of the most comprehensive of its kind, predicts which activities are conducted when, where, for how long, with whom, and the transport mode involved. In addition, various situational, temporal, spatial, spatial-temporal and institutional constraints are incorporated in the model. The decision tree is proposed as a formalism to represent an exhaustive set of mutually exclusive rules for each decision step in the model. A CHAID decision tree induction method is used to derive decision trees from activity diary data. The case study conducted to develop and test the model indicates that performance of the model is very satisfactory. We conclude therefore that the methodology proposed in this article is useful to develop computational process models of activity-travel choice behavior. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

The authors extend previous research by modeling consumer complaining behavior as a complex, dynamic process, hypothesizing that once a consumer seeks redress, negative word-of-mouth behavior and repatronage intentions are dependent (primarily) upon the consumer's postcomplaint perception of justice. As hypothesized, perceived justice was found to be the main determinant of complainants' negative word-of-mouth behavior and their repatronage intentions, and was found to mediate the effects of likelihood of success, attitude toward complaining, product importance, and stability and controllability on complaining behavior. The model fit the data very well, explaining 49.1 percent of the variance of negative word-of-mouth and 68.5 percent of the variance of repatronage intentions. These findings point to the importance of customer service/customer satisfaction, especially since the cost of keeping a current customer satisfied is much less than the cost of attracting a new customer. © 1993.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-33845339150"

We incorporate a detailed consumer channel choice model in which the demand faced in each channel depends on the service levels of both channels as well as the consumers' valuation of the product and shopping experience. The direct channel's service is measured by the delivery lead time for the product; the retail channel's service is measured by product availability. We identify optimal dual channel strategies that depend on the channel environment described by factors such as the cost of managing a direct channel, retailer inconvenience, and some product characteristics. We also determine when the manufacturer should establish a direct channel or a retail channel if he is already selling through one of these channels. Finally, we conduct a sequence of controlled experiments with human subjects to investigate whether our model makes reasonable predictions of human behavior. We determine that the model accurately predicts the direction of changes in the subjects' decisions, as well as their channel strategies in response to the changes in the channel environment. These observations suggest that the model can be used in designing channel strategies for an actual dual channel environment.1 © 2008 INFORMS.","Direct channel; Dual channels; Experimental economics; Product availability; Service competition; Supply chain contracting","Behavioral research; Building materials; Competition; Distribution of goods; Electronic commerce; Supply chain management; Supply chains; Direct channel; Dual channels; Experimental economics; Product availability; Service competition; Sales","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-52549123379"

As a result, green marketing has a substantial body of academic research. The purpose of our paper is to synthesize and provide a comprehensive overview of individual-level consumer behavior theories in green marketing. We begin by defining the term green marketing. Next, we conduct a large-scale review of more than 20 consumer-level theories grouped into six categories. For each theory, we present its definition, application in green marketing, and suggestions for future areas of research. Despite the breadth of theories that we uncovered, most studies indicate that few consumers will pay more for green products and that behavior in one environmental context does not necessarily translate into comparable behavior in another context. Another important finding is a great disconnect between consumer green purchasing intention and actual green purchasing behavior. To address this challenge, we provide two groups of additional applicable theories that have not yet been applied to green marketing. These theory groups are behavioral intentions, or non-economic green purchase influencers, and instantiaters, which moderate the motivation – green purchase behavior link. Managers can use our conceptual framework illustrating the relationship among these theories to help understand the stages in a consumer's green purchase process. Our study also can aid managers in developing tools to achieve a competitive marketplace advantage. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Behavior; Consumer theory; Environment; Green marketing; Literature review","Commerce; Managers; Marketing; Purchasing; Sales; Behavior; Consumer theory; Environment; Green marketing; Literature reviews; Consumer behavior","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85038844703"

Consumers prefer regarding themselves as socially responsible individuals. Voluntary contributions to public goods are motivated by this preference. The self-image as socially responsible is determined by a comparison of one's actual behavior against an endogenous morally ideal behavior. Public policy influences voluntary contributions through its effects on relative prices and budget or time constraints, but also indirectly through the policy's effect on the morally ideal contribution. This implies that economic incentives may have adverse effects on contributions. We present survey data on recycling behavior and voluntary community work, which is consistent with the model predictions. © 2002 Elsevier B.V.

Design/methodology/approach: Interpretive phenomenological analysis and syllogisms, as a basis for conceptual metaphor theory and critical discourse analysis, were employed. Evidence supported by discussions and participant observation method, whilst attending Oxford Global Islamic Branding and Marketing Forum, 26-27 July 2010, Saïd Business School, University of Oxford - in addition to the empirical data presented by keynote speakers. Findings: The author asserts that halal-conscious consumers are risk averse, which drives discerning and high-involvement behavioural traits. Furthermore, in the face of this, brand managers are still unclear how far they can push more emotionally led brand messages. Finally, the paper presents a halal decision-making paradigm - as a basis for constructing salient and engaging brands. The halal paradigm is a nub where the perceived importance of halal is brought into the Muslim consciousness. This is a dynamic and cyclical process, whose final verdict is finite and perishable - due to hyper-sensitivity and environmental factors influencing Muslim perceptions of what is halal. Research limitations/implications: The models presented synthesise conceptual thinking with primary and secondary data. Further, tests related to specific brands are suggested. Originality/value: Whilst the author concurs with the general Islamic principle of halal being the norm and haram as the exception, within the halal paradigm of consumption attached to consumerism, an argument is put forward asserting that this is increasingly being reversed. Furthermore, it is proposed that brand theory could view brands as Muslims. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Brand management; Branding; Consumer behaviour; Islam","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84863456880"

It is associated with circular economy system (CE), propagated by the European Union. Circular economy systems keep the added value in products for as long as possible and virtually eliminate waste. Transition to a more circular economy requires changes throughout value chains, from product design to new business and market models, from new ways of turning waste into a resource to new modes of consumer behaviour. These actions relate to all industries, including the construction industry. Nowdays, the increase in demand for construction materials as a result of development has called for an alternative way to develop or derive construction materials from different sources, including sewage sludge ash (SSA). SSA is produced after the firing process of sewage sludge, and it must be disposed by other means. Researches were already accomplished investigating the use of sewage sludge ash for the building materials manufacturing, such as produce bricks and tiles, as a raw materials for cement production, as aggregates for concrete and mortar, as a component of the synthesis of lightweight materials and as substitute for sand and/or cement in cement stabilized bases, subbases and embankments in road constuctions.

An important reason for this may be that the evaluative criteria consumers use in both stages of the adoption process weigh differently. Using construal level theory, we develop expectations on the influence of innovation characteristics across the intention and behavior stages of the adoption process. Using meta-analysis, we derive generalizations on drivers of intentions and actual innovation adoption behavior. The results show important differences across both stages. Consumers show higher levels of adoption intention for innovations that are more complex, better match their needs, and involve lower uncertainty. However, consumers are found to actually adopt innovations with less complexity and higher relative advantages. Adopter demographics are found to explain little variance in adoption intention and behavior, whereas adopter psychographics are found to be influential in both stages.

The auctions also allow us to better understand the potential impact of offering new and remanufactured products at the same time, which provides us insights into the potential for new product cannibalization. Our results indicate that, for the consumer and commercial products auctioned, there is a clear difference in WTP) for new and remanufactured goods. For the consumer product, there is scant overlap in bidders between the new and remanufactured products, leading us to conclude that the risk of cannibalization in this case is minimal.

We focus in this paper on recent changes in the form of social computing. Although the content industry has implemented social computing to a large extent, it has done so from a techno-centric approach in which social features are viewed as complementary rather than integral to content. This approach does not capitalize on users' social behavior in the website and does not answer the content industry's need to elicit payment from consumers. We suggest that both of these objectives can be achieved by acknowledging the fusion between content and community, making the social experience central to the content website's digital business strategy. We use data from Last.fm, a site offering both music consumption and online community features. The basic use of Last.fm is free, and premium services are provided for a fixed monthly subscription fee. Although the premium services on Last.fm are aimed primarily at improving the content consumption experience, we find that willingness to pay for premium services is strongly associated with the level of community participation of the user. Drawing from the literature on levels of participation in online communities, we show that consumers' willingness to pay increases as they climb the so-called ""ladder of participation"" on the website. Moreover, we find that willingness to pay is more strongly linked to community participation than to the volume of content consumption. We control for self-selection bias by using propensity score matching. We extend our results by estimating a hazard model to study the effect of community activity on the time between joining the website and the subscription decision. Our results suggest that firms whose digital business models remain viable in a world of ""freemium"" will be those that take a strategic rather than techno-centric view of social media, that integrate social media into the consumption and purchase experience rather than use it merely as a substitute for offline soft marketing. We provide new evidence of the importance of fusing social computing with content delivery and, in the process, lay a foundation for a broader strategic path for the digital content industry in an age of growing user participation.","Digital business strategy; Ladder of participation; Online communities; Premium services; Propensity score matching; Social media; UGC","Consumer behavior; Ladders; Planning; Social networking (online); Strategic planning; Websites; Digital business strategy; On-line communities; Premium services; Propensity score matching; Social media; Online systems","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84876819631"

What political impact does this form of consumption have on society? Is it a small and unimportant ""blip,"" in the overall march of globalized, industrialized food and rationalized consumption systems. Is it even, perhaps, complicit in this process? Or it is a radical break? The array of answers to these questions forms the ""production-consumption debate"" currently taking place in the examination of agro-food systems. If agro-food networks are conceptualized as interactive, socio-ecological metabolic circuits linking agricultural nature, social labor, the corporeal and the symbolic, then this paper argues that analytical concern in agro-food studies has focused overwhelmingly on the production 'moment' in these circuits. Despite the lessons of numerous 'food scares', anti-GMO movements and the mad cow disease pandemic, an asymmetry now holds sway in agro-food studies between production and consumption even though in other fields, as Jackson (1999) notes, consumption has been ""duly 'acknowledged'"" (p. 95). As this asymmetry is addressed, a contemporary reformulation of the 'agrarian question' might investigate the potential for new forms of progressive food politics, ranging from 'weak' struggles over the modes of social orderings, such as knowledge systems, to more formal alliances between producers and consumers.","","agroindustry; consumption behavior; food production; rural politics","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0036063244"

In addition, online advertising has greatly improved in its use of external browsing data to target Internet ads. Dynamic retargeting integrates these two advances by using information from the browsing history on the firm's website to improve advertising content on external websites. When surfing the Internet, consumers who previously viewed products on the firm's website are shown ads with images of those same products. To examine whether this is more effective than simply showing generic brand ads, the authors use data from a field experiment conducted by an online travel firm. Surprisingly, the data suggest that dynamic retargeted ads are, on average, less effective than their generic equivalents. However, when consumers exhibit browsing behavior that suggests their product preferences have evolved (e.g., visiting review websites), dynamic retargeted ads no longer underperform. One explanation for this finding is that when consumers begin a product search, their preferences are initially construed at a high level. As a result, they respond best to higher-level product information. Only when they have narrowly construed preferences do they respond positively to ads that display detailed product information. This finding suggests that in evaluating how best to reach consumers through ads, managers should be aware of the multistage nature of consumers' decision processes and vary advertising content along these stages. © 2013, American Marketing Association.","Construal level theory; Field experiments; Online advertising; Online decision process; Retargeting","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84886686977"

We assessed the utility of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), and the Value-based Adoption Model (VAM) using data collected from a survey sample of 378 respondents, modeling user acceptance in terms of behavioral intention to use AI-based intelligent products.

Using longitudinal data from a convenience store franchise, the study shows that consumers who were heavy buyers at the beginning of a loyalty program were most likely to claim their qualified rewards, but the program did not prompt them to change their purchase behavior. In contrast, consumers whose initial patronage levels were low or moderate gradually purchased more and became more loyal to the firm. For light buyers, the loyalty program broadened their relationship with the firm into other business areas.

We also discuss how goal structures can be assessed empirically, and we illustrate the procedure through an exploratory study of the higher-level goals underlying consumers' weight loss behaviors. To demonstrate the value of taking a structural perspective on goals, we provide evidence that knowledge of the means-end connections between goals yields important information about consumers' involvement with weight loss, and that this information cannot be gained from a knowledge of the goals alone. © 1995.","Goal-directed behavior; Laddering; Means-end chain theory","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-0001463353"

However, little is known about the innovation activities of end users in the field of consumer goods. The author reports on a survey of the innovation activities and characteristics of 153 users of outdoor-related consumer products. He finds a high level of innovation by these consumers. The results also reveal that innovating users can be reliably distinguished from non-innovating ones by characteristics such as the benefit they expect from using their innovations and the level of expertise they have in the use of the products. Taken together, these two findings - frequent innovation by consumers and the possibility to identify efficiently those who innovate - imply that innovation by users can be an important source of new product ideas for consumer goods companies. Effective utilisation of this resource will require significant changes in methodologies for customer-driven idea generation. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Adventure tourism is chosen as the setting. A logit model is used to test the hypothesis. The study results reveal that tourists’ mastering and psychological co-creation are significant for value perception. Further, value perception is found to mediate the relation between participation and satisfaction. Consequently, tourists’ participation augments satisfaction by creating value in the experience. This study contributes to the theory in two ways. First, it reveals the importance of including the mastering and co-creation dimensions in acknowledging tourists’ as resource integrators for value creation in experiences. Second, satisfaction in tourism consumption evolves through tourists’ participation in creating value of the experience. © 2016","Co-creation; Experiential consumption; Mastering; Perceived value; Satisfaction","consumption behavior; hypothesis testing; modeling; perception; tourist behavior; valuation","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85002323071"

In psychology, the dominant computer metaphor of information processing has been challenged by researchers demonstrating various manners in which mental activity is grounded in sensory experience. These findings are arduous to explain using the amodal model of the human mind. In this introduction, we first delineate key assumptions of the information processing paradigm and then discuss some of the key conceptual challenges posed by the research generally appearing under the titles of embodiment, grounded cognition, or sensory marketing. We then address the use of bodily feelings as a source of information; next, we turn to the role of context sensitive perception, imagery, and simulation in consumer behavior, and finally discuss the role of metaphors.

Adoption dynamics for alternative vehicles are complex, owing to the size and importance of the auto industry and vehicle installed base. Diffusion of alternative vehicles is both enabled and constrained by powerful positive feedbacks arising from scale and scope economies, research and development, learning by doing, driver experience, word of mouth, and complementary resources such as fueling infrastructure. We describe a dynamic model of the diffusion of and competition among alternative fuel vehicles, including coevolution of the fleet technology, behavior, and complementary resources. Here we focus on the generation of consumer awareness of alternatives through feedback from consumers' experience, word of mouth, and marketing, with a reduced-form treatment of network effects and other positive feedbacks (which we treat in other papers). We demonstrate the existence of a critical threshold for sustained adoption of alternative technologies, and show how the threshold depends on economic and behavioral parameters. We show that word of mouth from those not driving an alternative vehicle is important in stimulating diffusion. Expanding the model boundary to include learning, technological spillovers, and spatial coevolution of fueling infrastructure adds additional feedbacks that condition the diffusion of alternative vehicles. Results show scenarios for successful diffusion of alternative vehicles, but also suggest that marketing programs and subsidies for alternatives must remain in place for long periods for diffusion to become self-sustaining. © 2008 Pion Ltd and its Licensors.","","alternative fuel; automobile; coevolution; numerical model; technology adoption; technology diffusion; threshold; transportation development; transportation planning; transportation system","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-65949102097"

Even though consumers demand more ethical responsibility from companies, it is debatable if consumers would sacrifice their own personal needs to support ethically produced clothing. Design/methodology/approach - Focus groups are conducted in the UK and Germany in order to elicit consumers' beliefs and attitudes towards ethical issues in the fashion industry and its effect on purchase behaviour. Questionnaires are administrated to verify the outcome of the focus groups. Findings - The findings from this research demonstrate little evidence that ethical issues have any effect on consumers' fashion purchase behaviour. When it comes to fashion purchase, personal needs motivate consumers primarily to buy garments and take precedence over ethical issues. Research limitations/implications - Only a specific age group between 18 and 26-years-old is interviewed. Both research methods are undertaken in the area of Manchester, England, and the area of Frankfurt, Germany, which perhaps limits the meaning of the results. Practical implications - Consumers feel that they are often unable to make an ethical choice. Therefore they do seem to need more information to allow them to make better ethical judgements and there is a role for ethical fashion companies to communicate this more effectively. Originality/value - This research paper gives insight into ethical fashion purchasing behaviour among UK and German consumers and provides information to improve the potential of ethical fashion.","Buying behaviour; Customer satisfaction; Ethics; Fashion industry; Germany; United Kingdom","consumer research; ethics; fashion","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-33748308973"

Consumers, therefore, are switching over to organic food products and are willing to pay a premium price. The purpose of this study is to examine the factors influencing the consumers' actual buying behaviour towards organic foods. For this purpose, a survey data were collected from 611 Indian consumers through a structured questionnaire. The data were analysed using various techniques like factor analysis, independent t-test, ANOVA multiple linear regression, and hierarchical multiple regression analysis. Results have confirmed four factors (health consciousness, knowledge, subjective norms, and price) that influence the consumer attitude towards organic food products. However, purchase intention towards organic foods is affected by these four factors along with one additional factor (i.e., availability). The results show that these five factors also influence the actual buying behaviour but attitude and purchase intention mediates the relationship. Further, socio-demographic factors (age, education and income) also found to have an impact on actual buying behaviour. This study provides a better understanding of consumers' attitude, purchase intention and actual buying behaviour towards organic food products.

For this purpose, the empirical data were collected by means of a written survey instrument from customers who had previously visited an organic food restaurant. The hypotheses were analyzed with maximum-likelihood estimation. The findings revealed that PFQ positively influences PF and PV. The significant positive relationships were also confirmed between PF, PV, and CS. The findings were also supported that consumers’ behavioral intentions are influenced by CS. Furthermore, CS acts as a partial mediator among PFQ, PF, PV and behavioral intentions.

They argue that the same behavior, bargaining assertively, is construed as congruent with female gender roles in some contexts yet incongruent in other contexts. Further, women take this contextual variation into account, adjusting their bargaining behavior to manage social impressions. A particularly important contextual variable is advocacy-whether bargaining on one's own behalf versus on another's behalf. In self-advocacy contexts, women anticipate that assertiveness will evoke incongruity evaluations, negative attributions, and subsequent ""backlash""; hence, women hedge their assertiveness, using fewer competing tactics and obtaining lower outcomes. However, in other-advocacy contexts, women achieve better outcomes as they do not expect incongruity evaluations or engage in hedging. In a controlled laboratory experiment, the authors found that gender interacts with advocacy context in this way to determine negotiation style and outcomes. Additionally, process measures of anticipated attributions and backlash statistically mediated this interaction effect. © 2010 American Psychological Association.","advocacy; backlash; gender; negotiation","Assertiveness; Attitude; Consumer Advocacy; Fear; Female; Gender Identity; Helping Behavior; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Male; Negotiating; Social Behavior; Young Adult; adult; article; assertiveness; attitude; consumer advocacy; cooperation; fear; female; gender identity; human; human relation; interpersonal communication; male; social behavior","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-76449117745"

This paper provides insights into consumer behavior, and the results have important implications for designers, managers, marketers, and system providers of mobile shopping (m-shopping) web sites. Design/methodology/approach: An empirical investigation was carried out to test the hypotheses. The samples include 369 professional participants. For testing the relationships of the model, structural equation modeling (SEM) is used. Findings: The results demonstrate that anxiety, which is an affective barrier against using innovative systems, is a key negative predictor of a customer's intentions to use mobile phones. Also, the consumer's self-perception of mobile skillfulness significantly affects anxiety, enjoyment, and usefulness. Furthermore, enjoyment, usefulness, and compatibility have an impact on a customer's behavioral intentions. Practical implications: The findings of this study help to understand what hinders or encourages the m-shopping intention of online customers. Originality/value: The results not only help develop a sophisticated understanding of mobile commerce theories for researchers, but they also offer useful knowledge to those involved in promoting m-shopping to potential purchasers. The value of the paper is that the results could be applied to other portable information technology service adoptions, such as personal digital assistants (PDA), smart phones, advanced mobile phones, and portable global positioning systems (GPS). © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Consumer behaviour; Internet shopping; Mobile communication systems","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-70349639386"

Technology readiness (TR), i.e. the customer's mental readiness to accept new technologies, has been proposed as such a factor. TR comprises four dimensions: innovativeness, optimism, discomfort and insecurity. This article investigates the effects of TR on customers' (1) attitudes towards using SST for airline check-in, (2) adoption of self-service check-in, and (3) evaluations of a new self-service check-in on the Internet, in terms of perceived service quality, satisfaction and loyalty. An empirical study was conducted among loyalty program customers of a European airline, having access to Internet check-in. Data were collected with online and traditional mail surveys, resulting in 1258 usable responses. Analysis of the data revealed that only optimism and innovativeness formed unique individual dimensions. Furthermore, TR had surprisingly little impact on customer attitudes towards SST, on adoption behaviour, and on SST evaluations. Optimism explained consumer behaviour towards SSTs best, whereas innovativeness had only a marginal effect on attitudes towards using the Internet or a mobile phone to check-in. The article concludes with a discussion of the validity of the TR construct and suggestions for future research. Managerial implications are provided. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Yet cultural factors moderate many aspects of consumer's impulsive buying behavior, including self-identity, normative influences, the suppression of emotion, and the postponement of instant gratification. From a multi-country survey of consumers in Australia, United States, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Malaysia, our analyses show that both regional level factors (individualism-collectivism) and individual cultural difference factors (independent-interdependent self-concept) systematically influence impulsive purchasing behavior.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0038460049"

Patient-centered interactions are those in which the patient's point of view is actively sought by the physician. This implies that the physician behaves in a manner that facilities the patient's expressing himself and that, for his part, the patient speaks openly and asks questions. The present exploratory study was undertaken to assess whether patient-centered interviews are related to positive outcomes. The study was conducted in 24 family physicians' offices where 140 doctor-patient interactions were audiotaped. Patients with both acute and chronic illnesses were included. The taped interactions were analysed using Bales Interaction Process Analysis. Ten days after the audiotaped visit the patients were interviewed in their home in order to assess their satisfaction with care, their reported compliance and to conduct a pill count. Bivariate analysis indicated that interviews in which physicians demonstrated a high frequency of patient-centered behaviour were related to significantly higher reported compliance and close to significantly better pill counts and satisfaction. Furthermore, in most instances, when the patient and physician scores were considered in combination, there was evidence that the physician's behaviour, particularly that sort of behaviour which initiated a discussion such as an explicit request for the patient's opinion, had more impact upon outcome than did the patient behaviour. The study suggests the importance in the setting of family practice of a patient-centred approach, one which is similar to models such as the negotiated approach to patienthood, described by psychiatrists. Two directions for future research are suggested. Firstly, analysis of the sequence of behaviours in the interactions must be undertaken to assess the impact of timing and initiation of behaviours upon outcomes. Secondly, although the validity of the attitudes and behaviours chosen as outcome measures will be acceptable to many readers, the next step is for future studies to assess the impact of a patient-centred approach upon the ultimate outcome, patient's health. © 1984.","","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Child; Child, Preschool; Consumer Satisfaction; Family Practice; Female; Human; Infant; Male; Middle Age; Patient Compliance; Physician-Patient Relations; Socioeconomic Factors; adolescent; adult; aged; article; child; consumer; doctor patient relation; female; general practice; human; infant; male; methodology; patient compliance; preschool child; socioeconomics","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0021156162"

Yet, in spite of this experience, many communities are having substantial difficulty achieving their collaborative objective, and many funders of community partnerships and participation initiatives are looking for ways to get more out of their investment. One of the reasons we are in this predicament is that the practitioners and researchers who are interested in community collaboration come from a variety of contexts, initiatives, and academic disciplines, and few of them have integrated their work with experiences or literatures beyond their own domain. In this article, we seek to overcome some of this fragmentation of effort by presenting a multidisciplinary model that lays out the pathways by which broadly participatory processes lead to more effective community problem solving and to improvements in community health. The model, which builds on a broad array of practical experience as well as conceptual and empirical work in multiple fields, is an outgrowth of a joint-learning work group that was organized to support nine communities in the Turning Point initiative. Following a detailed explication of the model, the article focuses on the implications of the model for research, practice, and policy. It describes how the model can help researchers answer the fundamental effectiveness and ""how-to"" questions related to community collaboration. In addition, the article explores differences between the model and current practice, suggesting strategies that can help the participants in, and funders of, community collaborations strengthen their efforts.","Civic problem solving; Collaboration; Community engagement; Empowerment; Partnership effectiveness; Social ties; Synergy","Community Health Planning; Community Networks; Consumer Participation; Cooperative Behavior; Group Processes; Humans; Interinstitutional Relations; Leadership; Models, Organizational; Problem Solving; Psychology, Social; Social Problems; United States; Urban Health; clinical practice; community care; health care planning; health care policy; health promotion; human; medical research; preventive health service; priority journal; problem solving; public health; review; consumer; cooperation; group process; health; health care planning; leadership; methodology; nonbiological model; organization and management; public relations; social problem; social psychology; United States","Review","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-0347275939"

Each country produces a good that is consumed by domestic households. Production of each consumption good results in emissions of pollutants. Households in each country derive utility from the consumption of the domestically produced good but incur costs through the total stock of pollution (stock externality). In this setting we characterize cooperative as well as noncooperative pollution control strategies of the governments of the two countries that maximize the discounted stream of net benefits of a representative consumer. It turns out that when the governments are restricted to use linear strategies noncooperative behavior results in overall losses for both countries. If, on the contrary, governments use nonlinear Markov-perfect strategies and the discount rate is small enough a Pareto-efficient steady-state pollution stock can be supported as a differentiable subgame-perfect equilibrium. Thus, the emergence of first-best solutions (cooperative outcomes) does not require any institutional arrangements (threats, retaliation, etc.) but can be brought about through the use of nonlinear Markov-perfect equilibrium strategies. © 1993 by Academic Press, Inc.","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-43949175817"

Attitudes and attitude change are often examined to help reach this goal. But although attitudes are relatively good predictors of behaviour and are relatively easy to change they only help explain specific behaviours. More stable individual factors such as values and identities may affect a wider range of behaviours. In particular factors which are important to the self are likely to influence behaviour across contexts and situations. This paper examines the role of values and identities in explaining individual pro-environmental behaviours. Secondary analyses were conducted on data from three studies on UK residents, with a total of 2694 participants. Values and identities were good predictors of pro-environmental behaviour in each study and identities explain pro-environmental behaviours over and above specific attitudes. The link between values and behaviours was fully mediated by identities in two studies and partially mediated in one study supporting the idea that identities may be broader concepts which incorporate values. The findings lend support for the concept of identity campaigning to promote sustainable behaviour. Moreover, it suggests fruitful future research directions which should explore the development and maintenance of identities. © 2012, © 2012 Academy of Social Sciences.","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84919701100"

Using data from customer dissatisfaction with three different service categories, the proposed model is subjected to empirical investigation.

Researchers have assumed, if only tacitly, that consumers are knowledgeable of brand origins, and that this knowledge is a significant influence that drives judgments of product quality, brand attitudes, and choice behavior in the marketplace. Using categorization theory and attribute diagnosticity as the theoretical foundation, our research reveals that consumers actually have only modest knowledge of the national origins of brands, and that American consumers' proficiency at recognizing foreign brand origins is predicted by variables such as socioeconomic status, past international travel, foreign language skills, and gender. In the second of two studies, we determined that brand origin recognition is based largely on consumers' associations of brand names with languages that suggest country origins. These studies ultimately lead us to conclude that past research has inflated the influence that country of origin information has on consumers' product judgments and behavior and its importance in managerial and public policy decisions. © 2005 Academy of International Business All rights reserved.","Brand origin knowledge; Country; Language","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-22544440307"

Four laboratory experiments involving stockouts in a consumer choice context are run. The results suggest that consumer response to stockouts is driven in large part by two factors: the effect of a stockout on the difficulty of making a choice from the set and the degree of personal commitment to the out-of-stock alternative. The results show that personal commitment to an out-of-stock choice option is a function of preference for the option, whether the option is included in the consumer's consideration set, and the degree to which the stockout announcement is personally directed. As personal commitment to the out-of-stock option increases, consumers react substantially and negatively to the stockout - they report lower satisfaction with the decision process and show a higher likelihood of switching stores on subsequent shopping trips. However, under conditions in which personal commitment to the out-of-stock option is low and the stockout leads to a decrease in the difficulty of making a product selection, consumer response to the stockout can actually be positive.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0034338888"

In this research, the author develops a theoretical framework of the brand personality construct by determining the number and nature of dimensions of brand personality (Sincerity, Excitement, Competence, Sophistication, and Ruggedness).

Thus, an important issue is why consumers vary in how they divide their purchases across outlets and how outlets can get a greater share of consumer expenditures. Two potential avenues for increasing customer share are to raise customer satisfaction, and increase repeat purchase through loyalty cards. This study examines the effects of customer satisfaction and loyalty cards as well as consumer characteristics on customer share spent on the primary grocery store. The findings suggest that customer satisfaction has a positive, albeit modest, effect on share while consumer economic shopping orientation has a negative direct effect on share. The economic orientation of shoppers, their felt importance of a personal relationship with store personnel, and the level of their aggregate purchase volume moderate the effect of satisfaction on customer share.

Thus, based on the attitude-behaviour-context theory, this study explored whether and how consumers’ greenwashing perceptions influence their green purchasing intentions by integrating the mediating role of green word-of-mouth (WOM) and the moderating role of green concern. Using a questionnaire survey of 553 consumers of batteries in China, the results demonstrate that consumers’ greenwashing perceptions not only have a direct negative impact on green purchasing intentions, but also have indirect negative effects via green WOM. Further, green concern strengthens the negative relationship between greenwashing perceptions and green purchasing intentions. Hence, this study suggests that firms should promote substantive environmental initiatives rather than greenwashing to ensure consumers and increase sales. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Green concern; Green purchasing intentions; Green word-of-mouth (green WOM); Greenwashing perception","Commerce; Competition; Surveys; Competitive advantage; Environmental initiatives; Environmental problems; Green concern; Green purchasing; Greenwashing; Questionnaire surveys; Word of mouth; Sales","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85054021113"

The questionnaire survey using an online panel in a selected country was conducted to identify how consumers from the Baby Boomers, X and Y generations changed their shopping behaviour and which needs they gave preference to during the pandemic crisis in relation to their fears. Using a multiple regression analysis, we demonstrated that fear appeal (fears for health and economic fears) are associated with the changes in customer behaviour and influence traditional and online shopping related to COVID-19.

They investigate their predictions regarding selfaccountability in multiple ways, including examining the moderating roles of awareness of the discrepancy between a person's internal standards and actual behavior, self-accountability priming, and the presence of others in the decision context. Furthermore, they demonstrate that the subtle activation of self-accountability leads to more positive reactions to ethical appeals than explicit guilt appeals. Finally, they show that preference for a product promoted through ethical appeals is driven by the desire to avoid anticipated guilt, beyond the effects of impression management.

Lockdown is among options suggested to reduce spread of the virus. This study aimed to determining the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on Tunisian consumer awareness, attitudes and behaviors related to food wastage. An online survey was conducted during the first 2 weeks of COVID-19 lockdown. The survey collected information on demographic data, awareness and attitudes toward food waste, food purchase behavior and household food expenditure estimation; extent of household food waste; willingness and information needs to reduce food waste. This study included 284 respondents. About 89% of respondents claimed to be aware of food waste, and the COVID-19 lockdown would impact for 93% of respondents, their waste levels, and for 80%, their grocery shopping habits. Interestingly, the COVID-19 lockdown improved food shopping performances and pushed toward a positive behavioral change regarding food wastage: 85% respondents declared nothing of what they bought would be discarded, and most of the respondents have set up a strategy of saving, storing and eating leftovers. The most cited reasons given for discarding food were overcooking, inappropriate storage and overbuying. Consumers’ changes in food waste prevention might be probably driven more by the socioeconomical context of the COVID-19 lockdown (i.e. food availability, restricted movements, loss of income), than by a pro-environmental concern. Finally, our study pointed out the consumers’ needs of information for taking further action. In conclusion, our study can constitute a basis to further promote household food waste prevention behavior, outlasting the COVID-19 crisis. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Consumers’ behavior; COVID-19 lockdown; Household food waste; Saving strategy","Tunisia; Coronavirus; consumption behavior; data acquisition; demographic survey; domestic waste; food waste; perception; public attitude; questionnaire survey; viral disease; virus; World Wide Web","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85083648314"

By analyzing panel data from over 10,000 Internet households and three commodity-like products (books, compact discs (CDs), and air travel services), we show that the amount of online search is actually quite limited. On average, households visit only 1.2 book sites, 1.3 CD sites, and 1.8 travel sites during a typical active month in each category. Using probabilistic models, we characterize search behavior at the individual level in terms of (1) depth of search, (2) dynamics of search, and (3) activity of search. We model an individual's tendency to search as a logarithmic process, finding that shoppers search across very few sites in a given shopping month. We extend the logarithmic model of search to allow for time-varying dynamics that may cause the consumer to evolve and, perhaps, learn to search over time. We find that for two of the three product categories studied, search propensity does not change from month to month. However, in the third product category we find mild evidence of time-varying dynamics, where search decreases over time from already low levels. Finally, we model the level of a household's shopping activity and integrate it into our model of search. The results suggest that more-active online shoppers tend also to search across more sites. This consumer characteristic largely drives the dynamics of search that can easily be mistaken as increases from experience at the individual level.","Consumer behavior; Dynamic consumer search; Electronic commerce; Stochastic models","Compact disks; Consumer products; Electronic commerce; Mathematical models; Product design; Search engines; Consumer behavior; Dynamic consumer search; Stochastic models; Online searching","Review","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-1842682496"

In the environmental economics literature the stated preference approach has come to be known as ""contingent valuation"" as the ""valuation"" estimated obtained from preference information given the respondent is said to be ""contingent"" on the details of the ""constructed market"" for the environmental good put forth in the survey. Work on contingent valuation now typically comprises the largest single group of papers at major environmental economics conferences and in several of the leading journals in the field. As such, it is impossible to ""review"" the literature per se or even cover all of the major papers in the area in some detail. Instead, in this chapter we seek to provide a coherent overview of the main issues and how they fit together. The organization of the chapter is as follows. First, we provide an overview of the history of contingent valuation starting with its antecedents and foundational papers and then trace its subsequent development using several broad themes. Second, we put forth the theoretical foundations of contingent valuation with particular emphasis on ties to standard measures of economic welfare. Third, we look at the issue of existence/passive use considerations. Fourth, we consider the relationship of contingent valuation to information on preferences that can be obtained by observing revealed behavior and how the two sources of information might be combined. Fifth, we look at different ways in which preference information can be elicited in a CV survey, paying particular attention to the incentive structure posed by different elicitation formats. Sixth, we turn to econometric issues associated with these different elicitation formats. Seventh, we briefly consider survey design issues. Eighth, we look at issues related to survey administration and extrapolating the results obtained to the population of interest. Ninth, we describe the major controversies related to the use of contingent valuation and summarize the evidence. Finally, we provide some thoughts on where we think contingent valuation is headed in the future. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Consumers who believe that their decisions can significantly affect environmental and social issues are more likely to behave sustainably. Little is known, however, about how perceived consumer effectiveness can be increased. We find that feelings of guilt and pride, activated by a single consumption episode, can regulate sustainable consumption by affecting consumers’ general perception of effectiveness. This paper demonstrates the impact that guilt and pride have on perceived consumer effectiveness and shows how this effect rests on the ability of these emotions to influence perceptions of agency. After experiencing guilt or pride, consumers see themselves as the cause of relevant sustainability outcomes. The process of causal attribution associated with these emotions influences consumers’ use of neutralization techniques. Through the reduction in consumers’ ability to neutralize their sense of personal responsibility, guilt and pride positively influence perceived consumer effectiveness. The inability to rationalize-away their personal responsibility, persuades consumers that they affect sustainability outcomes through their decisions. The research advances our understanding of sustainable consumption and identifies a new avenue for the regulation of individual consumer behavior that has significant implications for the development of sustainable marketing initiatives. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Ethical consumption; Guilt; Perceived consumer effectiveness; Pride; Self-efficacy; Sustainable consumption","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84920940509"

This behaviour-based segmentation model uses several types of information characterizing individual consumers and their market context: sociodemographic, psychographic and product choice data. These data are combined in a normative conceptual framework that posits the formation of latent segments, each of which displays differing degrees of sensitivity to relevant product attributes. This permits results obtained by the proposed model structure to differ significantly from those of traditional segmentation techniques, which usually produce a set of groups characterized by smaller within-group than between-group variation in sociodemographic and/or psychographic variables. By making the segments behaviour-based, it is argued that the segments produced by the model will be more actionable and more directly relevant to management decision-making. The proposed model is applied to a data set involving choice of a beauty product offered by five national brands. The results show that the explanatory power of the latent segmentation and choice model is far greater than that of the MNL model, which is nested within our more general specification. The types of results available from the model are illustrated through the application. © 1994.","discrete choice; latent class; segmentation","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0002669144"

The conceptual model of this study combines two models (i.e. UTAUT2 and the D&M IS Success Model). A questionnaire survey was conducted to collect the required data from convenience sampling of Saudi bank customers. The main factors – performance expectancy, price value, facilitating conditions, hedonic motivation, habit, system quality and service quality – were found to have a significant impact on actual use behaviour. This study was cross-sectional, therefore future studies should implement longitudinal studies in order to re-collect the findings. Further, this study adopted convenience sampling of Saudi M-Banking users. This may adversely impact the issue of generalisability to the whole population. The gap in the M-Banking literature in Saudi Arabia would be bridged by proposing a comprehensive conceptual model that scrupulously clarifies the use of M-Banking from the perspective of Saudi users. Furthermore, this study would consider the adoption of numeric data in order to inferentially analyse them using SEM.

Results show that consumers from national cultures characterized by higher levels of uncertainty avoidance use information sources that are related to the channel (e.g., travel agent), instead of personal, destination marketing-related, or mass media sources; they also more frequently purchase prepackaged tours, travel in larger groups, and stay on average a shorter time and visit fewer number of destinations.

Information resolves two types of uncertainty: product value uncertainty (i.e., consumers realize valuations when they inspect the product in store, but may end up returning the product when they purchase online) and availability uncertainty (i.e., store visits are futile when consumers encounter stockouts). We consider three information mechanisms: physical showrooms allow consumers to learn valuations anytime they visit the store, even during stockouts; virtual showrooms give consumers online access to an imperfect signal of their valuations; availability information provides real-time information about whether the store has a product in stock. Our main results follow. First, physical showrooms may prompt retailers to reduce store inventory, which increases availability risk and discourages store patronage. Second, virtual showrooms may increase online returns and hurt profits, if they induce excessive customer migration from store to online channels. Third, availability information may be redundant when availability risk is low and may render physical showrooms ineffective when implemented jointly. Finally, when customers are homogeneous, these mechanisms may not exhibit significant complementarities and the optimal information structure may involve choosing only one of the three. © 2016 INFORMS.","Inventory availability; Omnichannel; Product value uncertainty; Retail operations; Strategic consumer behavior","Sales; Structural optimization; Information structures; Omnichannel; On-line access; Online channels; Product value; Real-time information; Retail operations; Strategic consumer behaviors; Consumer behavior","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85015192425"

We find that price is the major perceived barrier to purchase. Income is only a partial explanatory factor and is superseded by psychographic variables. Willingness to pay a premium is around 30% (ranging from 0% to 105%) and depends on consumer segments and product category. Price knowledge is vague, and organic consumers' price sensitivity is relatively lower than that of occasional or nonorganic consumers.

The paper introduces an integrated model which includes trust, perceived benefits, perceived web quality, and electronic word of mouth (eWOM) along with their relationships in order to examine their effects on consumer attitudes toward online shopping. Design/methodology/approach – A structured and self-administered online survey was employed targeting online shoppers of a reputable online retailer in Jordan; i.e. MarkaVIP. A sample of 273 online shoppers was involved in the online survey. A series of exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were used to assess the research constructs, unidimensionality, validity, and composite reliability. Structural path model analysis was also used to test the hypothesized relationships of the research model. Findings – The empirical findings of this study indicate that consumer attitudes toward online shopping is determined by trust and perceived benefits. Trust is a product of perceived web quality and eWOM and that the latter is a function of perceived web quality. Hence, trust and perceived benefits are key predictors of consumer attitudes toward online shopping, according to the results. Further, the authors also found that higher levels of perceived web quality lead to higher levels of trust in an online shopping web site. Perceived web quality was found to be a direct predictor of trust, and the former positively and significantly influences perceived benefits. Also, the authors found that 28 percent of the variation in online shopping attitudes was caused by perceived benefits and trust. Research limitations/implications – The research sample included only early adopters who are usually described as personal innovators and risk takers. Future research is encouraged to focus on other groups such as non-adopters to understand their online shopping attitudes. Another limitation is derived from the geographical context of the current study; that is Jordan. The findings are not necessarily applicable to other Arab countries and the rest of the world. Therefore, replications of the current study in different countries would most likely strengthen and validate its findings. Also, the study is cross-sectional which does not show how attitudes of consumers may change over time. The authors encourage future studies to employ a longitudinal design to understand the changes in consumers’ attitudes toward using online shopping over time. Finally, this study examined only one case in point and thus findings cannot be generalized to other online shopping web sites. Future research is highly encouraged to examine consumers’ attitudes toward other online shopping web sites inside and outside Jordan. Practical implications – The paper supports the importance of trust and perceived benefits as key drivers of attitudes toward online shopping in emerging markets like Jordan. It further underlines the importance of perceived web quality contribution to perceived benefits and trust as well as the key role of the later in forming online shoppers’ attitudes. Online retailers’ executives and managers can benefit from such findings for future e-marketing strategies and acquire new customers to achieve long-term performance objectives. Originality/value – This paper is one of the very few attempts that examined attitudes toward online shopping in the Arab world. Importantly, it revealed the drivers of online shoppers’ attitudes in Jordan. National and international online retailers planning to expand their operations to Jordan or to the Middle East Region have now valuable empirical evidence concerning the determinants of online shopping attitudes and online shoppers’ behavior in Jordan upon which e-marketing strategies can be formulated and implemented. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Jordan; Online attitudes; Online shopping; Perceived benefits; Trust; Web site quality","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84942519644"

This study attempts to explore the antecedents of ecologically conscious consumer behavior (ECCB) among young urban consumers in India – an emerging market experiencing rapid economic growth with increased urbanization and changes in consumption patterns that are contributing to environmental hazard. The empirical study including a literature review uses Theory of Planned Behavior integrating environmental attitudes, subjective norms, perceived consumer effectiveness, and behavioral intention in the model to investigate their influence on ECCB. The results suggest that attitudes and perceived consumer effectiveness both have a significant direct and indirect positive influence on ECCB. In addition, it would appear that the subjective norm, a measure of social demand, does not have any significant influence on behavioral intention leading to ECCB – contrary to established findings in a collective society considered in this study. This paper concludes with policy implications of the findings for marketers and policymakers, as well as potential directions for further research. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Green marketing; PCE; Perceived consumer effectiveness; Pro-environmental consumer behavior; Theory of planned behavior (TPB","Commerce; Economic and social effects; Economics; Marketing; Public policy; Urban growth; Behavioral intention; Environmental attitudes; Environmental concerns; Environmental deterioration; Environmental hazards; Green marketing; Perceived consumer effectiveness; Theory of Planned Behavior; Consumer behavior","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85043580730"

I test competing theories about the hierarchical structure of the coping construct. Study 2 validates these findings and begins to establish theoretical links between the coping dimensions and their antecedent relationships with discrete emotions. In contrast to extant research linking emotions and coping, which has only investigated main effect hypotheses, I conceptualize and find empirical evidence for a model in which emotions interact with appraisals jointly to enact coping strategies. This research contributes to the emerging consumer coping literature by enriching existing theoretical conceptualizations of consumer coping processes and by validating a scale that should prove useful in consumer research. ́ 2005 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-22144491906"

A burgeoning literature demonstrates that one source of value emerges from the capacity for products to serve as a psychological salve that reduces various forms of distress across numerous domains. This review systematically organizes and integrates the literature on the use of consumer behavior as a means to regulate self-discrepancies, or the incongruities between how one currently perceives oneself and how one desires to view oneself (Higgins, 1987). We introduce a Compensatory Consumer Behavior Model to explain the psychological consequences of self-discrepancies on consumer behavior. This model delineates five distinct strategies by which consumers cope with self-discrepancies: direct resolution, symbolic self-completion, dissociation, escapism, and fluid compensation. Finally, the authors raise critical questions to guide future research endeavors. Overall, the present review provides both a primer on compensatory consumer behavior and sets an agenda for future research. © 2016 Society for Consumer Psychology","Conspicuous consumption; Materialism; Self concept; Self discrepancy; Self regulation; Social comparison","","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84971602805"

The purpose of this paper is two-fold. One is to examine the evolution of organic food from what Belasco called the 'counter-cuisine' to what organic growers call 'yuppie chow', to show how organic salad mix was the carrier of major changes in the organic system of provision, thereby calling into question the notion that organic food is necessarily an antidote to industrialized food. The other is to problematize the facile dichotomies between fast and slow, reflexive and compulsive, fat and thin, and, hence, good and bad eaters, to show where there is slippage and instability in these categories, in addition to a troubling politics of class and gender.

Besides the need for appropriate policies and legislation for e-waste management, consumer awareness about recycling is an important factor. This paper discusses determinants of consumer intentions and behavior towards e-waste recycling in the major metropolitan areas of Brazil, where the consumption of electronic devices and appliances has significantly increased in the past decade. Modeling measures obtained from a general population survey sample after the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), we find that the majority of respondents hold a positive intention towards recycling electronic appliances - particularly, female, middle-aged individuals from lower income groups, and residents of the South-east region. Favorable views of recycling and the perceived social acceptance of recycling significantly explain the intention to recycle. In contrast, only a minority of respondents actually adopts adequate recycling practices connected to e-waste, a behavior which is socially skewed among the higher income echelons of Brazilian society.

This study aims to determine the distinct effects of informational, entertaining, remunerative and relational content on the passive and active engagement behavior of social media users. Design/methodology/approach: Facebook Insights and NCapture are used to extract data from the Facebook pages of 12 wine brands over a 12-month period. A multivariate linear regression analysis investigates the effects of content on consuming, contributing and creating engagement behavior. Findings: Results reveal distinct effects of rational and emotional appeals on social media engagement behavior. Rational appeals in social media have a superior effect in terms of facilitating active and passive engagement among social media users, whereas emotional appeals facilitate passive rather than highly active engagement behavior, despite the social and interactive nature of the digital media landscape. Research limitations/implications: Results contribute directly to understanding engagement and customer experience with social media. Further theoretical and empirical examination in this area will aid in understanding the dynamic nature of the levels of engagement within social media. Practical implications: Findings provide managers and practitioners with guidelines and opportunities for strategic development of social media content to enhance engagement among consumers in a social media forum. Originality/value: This study is one of the first to empirically examine the construct of social media engagement behavior. It extends the utility of dual processing theory to demonstrate how rational and emotional message appeals result in online engagement. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Dual processing theory; Engagement; Facebook; Social media content; Uses and gratifications theory","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85064042001"

We quantify the direct effect on real consumption of unanticipated changes in discretionary income, shifts in precautionary savings, and changes in the operating cost of energy-using durables. The possibility of asymmetries in the response of real consumption to energy price shocks is also considered. We demonstrate that linear models are consistent with the symmetric behavior of real consumption in 1979 (when energy prices increased sharply) and in 1986 (when they fell sharply). It is shown that historically energy price shocks have been an important factor in explaining U.S. real consumption growth, but by no means the dominant factor. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Thus, many studies have addressed the issue of post-complaint behavior. Conducting a meta-analysis, the authors test the following path model: ""organizational responses (compensation, favorable employee behavior, and organizational procedures) → justice perceptions (distributive, interactional, and procedural justice) → post-complaint satisfaction (transaction-specific and cumulative satisfaction) → customer behavioral intentions (loyalty and positive word of mouth [WOM])."" The results confirm this model as well as the mediating role of justice perceptions and post-complaint satisfaction. Surprisingly, the results also show that the common contention of distributive justice as the salient driver of service recovery is only true for transaction-specific satisfaction, which in turn reinforces positive WOM. Cumulative satisfaction, however, which is the primary antecedent of customer loyalty, even slightly more depends on interactional justice than on distributive justice. Further, the results show that the relationships between justice perceptions and satisfaction constructs depend on several moderators such as target group, industry, and complaint type. A major managerial implication is the fact that organizations should pay particular attention to distributive justice when complainants are students and to interactional justice when failure is nonmonetary or occurs in service industries. The authors discuss theoretical implications and provide suggestions for future research. © The Author(s) 2011.","complaint management; consumer complaints; customer satisfaction; meta-analysis; service recovery","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-78650757044"

Design/methodology/approach: From a consumer perspective, ecolabels are tools for supporting decision making with regard to environmentally significant products. The paper proposes an adoption of innovation framework for understanding consumer responses. The framework is applied in a mall-intercept survey of the early adoption of a new ecolabel, the MSC label for sustainable fishery, in Denmark. Findings: Early adopters of a new ecolabel mostly employ a high effort adoption process. Starting the adoption process depends on both motivation (intention to buy sustainable fish products) and ability (issue-relevant knowledge). Whether and how quickly the consumer completes the adoption depends on his or her motivation, past experience with using ecolabels, and trust in the endorsing organisation. Research limitations/implications: Environmental and product-related factors did not differ between respondents. Hence, a complete account of the importance of these factors for the adoption and (especially) diffusion of the label is not provided. Practical implications: Consumers scoring highly on both issue-relevant knowledge and motivation are the most likely innovators and early adopters. Their high level of expertise means that they do not need a lot of explanation for understanding the label and its self-relevance and their strong motivation means that they will search for more if they need it (and if it is not too difficult to get). Originality/value: The paper makes both a conceptual and an empirical contribution, which are of value both to practitioners (ecolabel promoters and users) and to research on ecolabel effectiveness. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Consumer behaviour; Innovation; Labelling; Regression analysis","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-78149391433"

The total shopping cost is composed of fixed and variable costs. The fixed cost is independent of, whereas the variable cost depends on, the shopping list (i.e., the products and their respective quantities to be purchased). Besides travel distance, the fixed cost includes a shopper's inherent preference for the store and historic store loyalty. The variable cost is a weighted sum of the quantities of items on the shopping list multiplied by their expected prices at the store. The article has three objectives: (1) to model and estimate the relative importance of fixed and variable shopping costs, (2) to investigate customer segmentation in response to shopping costs, and (3) to introduce a new measure (the basket size threshold) that defines competition between stores from a shopping cost perspective. The model controls for two important phenomena: Consumer shopping lists might differ from the collection of goods ultimately bought, and shoppers might develop category-specific store loyalty.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0032367374"

In an effort to cover all relevant literature, we searched for scientific articles published between January 2000 and March 2016. The search resulted in 34 articles which were analysed in detail. To assess the reviewed articles, the Alphabet Theory, which is a framework for explaining environmentally significant behaviour, was used. The review differentiates the results for consumers’ wine choice by the type of production method, e.g. sustainable, environmental friendly, organic or local. A considerable number of consumers across different countries had positive perceptions regarding these different production methods and reported a willingness to pay a premium for wine with characteristics of sustainable production. However, on average, consumers’ awareness of the broad concept of sustainability regarding wine seemed low in some European countries and North America. In particular, organic and sustainability labels were often perceived as quality indicators. In most cases, the studies focused on the environmental aspects of sustainability; environmental soundness was given most often as a determining factor in purchase decisions regarding wine with characteristics of sustainable production. Overall, social and economic aspects were only just examined. The results suggest that producing and marketing wine with sustainability characteristics is a promising strategy for quality differentiation, particularly for wine that is both local and organic. Moreover, marketers, retailers and producers will likely profit from developing information campaigns with a focus on environmental, as well as social and economic aspects to increase consumers’ knowledge of sustainable wine production, thus creating preferences and influencing purchase behaviour. Gaining a deeper understanding of consumers’ attitudes and their buying motives regarding different sustainability attributes is recommended for future studies. Since none of the articles examined purchase behaviour in real market scenarios with real market transactions, future research should focus, for example, on the analysis of household panel data as evidence of an attitude behaviour gap was found. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Alphabet Theory; Attitude-behaviour-gap; Organic; Sustainable; Willingness-to-pay; Wine","Breweries; Commerce; Marketing; Sales; Wine; Alphabet Theory; Attitude-behaviour-gap; Organic; Sustainable; Willingness to pay; Sustainable development","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85013639355"

Liquid consumption is defined as ephemeral, access based, and dematerialized, while solid consumption is defined as enduring, ownership based, and material. Liquid and solid consumption are conceptualized as existing on a spectrum, with four conditions leading to consumption being liquid, solid, or a combination of the two: relevance to the self, the nature of social relationships, accessibility to mobility networks, and type of precarity experienced. Liquid consumption is needed to explain behavior within digital contexts, in access-based consumption, and in conditions of global mobility. It highlights a consumption orientation around values of flexibility, adaptability, fluidity, lightness, detachment, and speed. Implications of liquid consumption are discussed for the domains of attachment and appropriation; the importance of use value; materialism; brand relationships and communities; identity; prosumption and the prosumer; and big data, quantification of the self, and surveillance. Lastly, managing the challenges of liquid consumption and its effect on consumer welfare are explored. © The Author 2017.

Marketing has long relied on the use of market segmentation. While birth age has been a useful way to create groups, it describes segments but does not help to understand segment motivations. However, environmental events experienced during one's coming of age create values that remain relatively unchanged throughout one's life. Such values provide a common bond for those in that age group, or generational cohort. Segmenting by 'coming of age' age provides a richer segmentation approach than birth age. This study compares two significant cohorts: Baby Boomers and Generation Y, with respect to their shopping behavior and purchase involvement for food, clothing and automobiles. For the three types of products, Baby Boomers value the retail experience and in-store service higher than Generation Y. For Baby Boomers, the purchase process starts with a retailer the consumer trusts, who gives advice for choosing the right product, while for Generation Y, the purchase process starts with choosing a product. This study presents implications for retail strategies that have an appeal to different generational cohorts and considers how retailers should deal with building customer relationships. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Baby Boomers; Consumer behavior; Generation Y; Generational cohorts; Generational marketing; Market segmentation; Purchase involvement; Retail strategies","cohort analysis; consumption behavior; generation time; marketing; retailing; shopping activity; strategic approach","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84875217036"

A major conclusion is that broad generalizations regarding the impact of the Internet on consumer information search behavior are not warranted and that, if the propositions possess any truth value, the Internet is not likely to be an information panacea for consumers. Because of the complexities of the Internet and information search behavior (individually and even more so when considered conjunctively), investigations of consumer information search behavior in the context of the Internet should especially focus on moderators of that behavior and interactions among the various antecedents of the behavior. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","","","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0037276942"

These clusters of variables, taken from 67 empirical studies culled from published and unpublished research, were metanalyzed. Of these sets of variables, the strongest predictors of recycling are internal facilitators: specifically, consumer knowledge and commitment to recycling best predicts propensity to recycle. External incentives-in particular, monetary rewards and social influence-are the next best predictors. One external facilitator that significantly relates to recycling is frequency of collection. Finally, these relationships are further examined to isolate the impact of moderator variables. Three variables are shown to have some moderating effects: sample size, when the study was done, and mode of data collection. Based on the results, the authors propose a model and provide practical implications for motivating consumer participation in waste separation programs. © 1995.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0000657554"

Yet in contrast, Chinese consumers express a positive ecological affect and green purchase intention. In relation to the hypothesis that the Chinese strongly adhere to the cultural value of living in harmony with nature, the relevant descriptive statistic shows that today's Chinese only pay moderate allegiance to this ""man-nature"" orientation.

Building on prior literature of browsing and motivation theory, this study views hedonic browsing and utilitarian browsing as two key drivers on impulse buying in mobile commerce. This study adopts partial least squares estimation to analyze the data obtained from an online questionnaire. Two main findings emerge. First, three situation factors (portability, visual appeal and interpersonal influence) differently affect hedonic browsing and utilitarian browsing. Second, hedonic browsing directly and positively influences consumers’ urge to buy impulsively, whereas utilitarian browsing indirectly influences consumers’ urge to buy impulsively through hedonic browsing.

The present research proposes a conceptual framework elucidating two primary motivations that underlie subsequent helping behavior: a desire to present a positive image to others and a desire to be consistent with one's own values. Importantly, the socially observable nature (public vs. private) of initial token support is identified as a key moderator that influences when and why token support does or does not lead to meaningful support for the cause. Consumers exhibit greater helping on a subsequent, more meaningful task after providing an initial private (vs. public) display of token support for a cause.

However, other sensory interfaces (e.g., including touch screens, together with a range of virtual, and augmented solutions) are increasingly being made available to people to interact online. Moreover, recent progress in the field of human–computer interaction means that online environments will likely engage more of the senses and become more connected with offline environments in the coming years. This expansion will likely coincide with an increasing engagement with the consumer's more emotional senses, namely touch/haptics, and possibly even olfaction. Forward-thinking marketers and researchers will therefore need to appropriate the latest tools/technologies in order to deliver richer online experiences for tomorrow's consumers.

Due to the sampling method, three of the surveys were representative of the socio-demographic structure of the German population in terms of six demographic variables that were selected for the quota sampling.

It also finds that a Web store that utilizes value-added search mechanisms and presents a positively challenging experience can increase customers' shopping enjoyment. Further, the more often customers return to a Web store, the more their shopping enjoyment is determined by their product involvement. Customers with low need specificity (i.e., who do not know what they are looking for) are more likely to use value-added search mechanisms.

But what drives the large variation in life insurance consumption across countries remains unclear. Using a panel with data aggregated at different frequencies for 68 economies in 1961-2000, this article finds that economic indicators-such as inflation, income per capita, and banking sector development-and religious and institutional indicators are the most robust predictors of the use of life insurance. Education, life expectancy, the young dependency ratio, and the size of the social security system appear to have no robust association with life insurance consumption. The results highlight the importance of price stability and banking sector development in fully realizing the savings and investment functions of life insurance in an economy.","","consumption behavior; financial services; institutional framework; insurance system; welfare provision","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0038162237"

This phenomenon is called online behavioral advertising (OBA). Although advertisers can benefit from OBA, the practice also raises concerns about privacy. Therefore, OBA has received much attention from advertisers, consumers, policymakers, and scholars. Despite this attention, there is neither a strong definition of OBA nor a clear accumulation of empirical findings. This article defines OBA and provides an overview of the empirical findings by developing a framework that identifies and integrates all factors that can explain consumer responses toward OBA. The framework suggests that the outcomes of OBA are dependent on advertiser-controlled factors (e.g., the level of personalization) and consumer-controlled factors (e.g., knowledge and perceptions about OBA and individual characteristics).

Although these studies have substantially contributed to our understanding of materialism, they shed little light on this value's relationship to consumer behavior. Our research seeks to address this gap by examining the influence of materialism on self- and communal-brand connections. We ground our conceptualization in terror management theory and suggest that materialistic individuals form strong connections to their brands as a response to existential insecurity. We test this premise by conducting a national survey among 314 adults as well as an experiment among 125 college students. Our results provide broad support for our thesis and suggest that the fear of death encourages materialistic individuals to form strong connections with their brands. © 2008 by Journal Of Consumer Research.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-67649227202"

Drawing upon contemporary attitude-behaviour research, a model is developed of intention to purchase GM food. The model is a modification of the Theory of Planned Behaviour [I. Ajzen, The theory of planned behaviour, Organ. Behav. Hum. Dec. Processes 50 (1991) 179] with self-identity as an additional determinant of intention. Also included in the model are a number of factors hypothesised as having relationships with the determinant components of the model, including prior purchasing based on concern for the environment and concern for personal health. Survey questions were developed using focus groups. The postal survey (N = 266) was undertaken in Canterbury, New Zealand. Key findings were that self-identity, attitude, subjective norm and perceived behavioural control were all significant in determining intention. In addition, these determinants were distinguished in terms of their relationships with age, gender, prior behaviour, and the believability of statements by companies engaged in GM food production. Changes in intention given the nature of its determinants are discussed. These hinge upon changes in altruistic concerns related to GM food production and consideration is given to tactics of proponents and opponents of the technology and implications for government policy. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Studying the four million MWOM messages sent via Twitter concerning 105 movies on their respective opening weekends, the authors find support for the Twitter effect and report evidence of a negativity bias. In a follow-up incident study of 600 Twitter users who decided not to see a movie based on negative MWOM, the authors shed additional light on the Twitter effect by investigating how consumers use MWOM information in their decision-making processes and describing MWOM’s defining characteristics. They use these insights to position MWOM in the word-of-mouth landscape, to identify future word-of-mouth research opportunities based on this conceptual positioning, and to develop managerial implications. © 2014, Academy of Marketing Science.","Early adoption; Microblogging; Movies; Twitter; Word of mouth communication","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84939891650"

However, despite these circumstances and the benefits offered, MPSs are still suffering from challenging situations related to their adoption and usage. The main challenge MPSs have faced in retail is because of the presence of consumer resistance toward their use. The present study investigates the different consumer barriers toward the intentions to use and recommend MPSs. The current study examines the adoption and usage of MPSs through the lens of innovation resistance. We developed the research model based on the innovation resistance theory (IRT) and tested it using a large cross-sectional study with 1256 MPS users. The study findings suggest that usage, risk, and value barriers are negatively associated with intentions to use MPSs. On the other hand, only usage and value barriers have a negative association with users’ intention to recommend MPSs. In comparison, the tradition and image barriers did not share any association with the user intentions. The study offers different implications for practitioners and researchers. © 2020 The Authors","Consumer behavior; Innovation resistance theory (IRT); Intentions to recommend; Mobile payments; Resistance; Use intention","consumption behavior; economic theory; electronic commerce; innovation; model; retailing; technology adoption","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85083066200"

First, the 'reformist' position, which focuses on firms pursuing green eco-innovations and consumers buying eco-efficient products, represents the political and academic orthodoxy. Second, the 'revolutionary' position, which is a radical critique of the mainstream, advocates the abolishment of capitalism, materialism, and consumerism, and promotes values such as frugality, sufficiency, and localism. We find this dichotomous debate problematic, because it is intellectually stifling and politically conservative (in its outcomes). To move beyond this dichotomy, we propose a third position, 'reconfiguration', which focuses on transitions in socio-technical systems and daily life practices and accommodates new conceptual frameworks. For each of the three positions, we discuss: (1) the scale and type of change, (2) views on consumption and production in exemplary approaches, (3) underlying theoretical, epistemological and normative orientations, (4) policy implications, and (5) critical appraisal. The conclusion compares the three positions, provides arguments for the fruitfulness of the reconfiguration-position and offers four critical reflections about future Sustainable Consumption and Production research agendas. © 2015 The Authors.","Conceptual review; Critical appraisal; Reform, revolution, and reconfiguration; Sustainable Consumption and Production","capitalism; conceptual framework; critical analysis; environmental research; innovation; institutional reform; policy implementation; political system; sustainability; theoretical study; consumption behavior; literature review; political geography; production system; reform process","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84935033236"

This research examines the proposition that social exclusion may produce either selffocused or prosocial responses, depending on which needs are threatened. Different types of social exclusion threaten different needs, which in turn produce distinct outcomes (differential needs hypothesis). Social exclusion in the form of being implicitly ignored increased conspicuous consumption, whereas being explicitly rejected increased helping and donation behavior. However, when efficacy needs (power, meaningful existence) were bolstered, the effects of being ignored were eliminated, whereas when relational needs (self-esteem) were bolstered, the effects of being rejected were eliminated. The results indicate that certain types of social exclusion produce prosocial responses, whereas others produce selffocused and attention-getting responses. © 2012 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84867004911"

We develop a framework that identifies five new sources of value creation and propose how these advance and transform competition for this interface. Depending on the importance of the new sources of value creation (in different purchase situations), stationary retailing may prevail as an important interaction point in a multichannel decision journey. However, increasing diffusion of branded-product platforms including connected devices and online retail platforms is shifting this authority to new players.

Nonetheless, the global trade is changing the way we perceive the origin of products and brands and their permissibility under Islamic Sharia laws. This apparently has serious implications for international companies operating in food, cosmetics and pharmaceutical products. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the role of Muslim attitude towards Halal products, their subjective norms and religiosity in predicting intention to choose Halal products. Design/methodology/approach: A structured question was designed to elicit consumer attitude, subjective norms, intention to choose Halal products and degree of inter and intra personal religiosity. Data were collected from 180 adult respondents using a convenience sampling method. Only 150 responses were deemed suitable for further analysis, yielding a response rate of 83 per cent. Stepwise regression analysis was used to test the proposed model. Findings: The results indicated that theory of reasoned action (TRA) is a valid model in predicting intention to choose Halal products. The results further indicate that subjective norms (β=0.455, p, 0.001), attitude towards the Halal products (β=0.265, p, 0.001) and intra personal religiosity (β=0.167, p, 0.001) positively influence attitude towards the Halal products. Interestingly, subjective norm appears to be the strongest of all the predictors for choosing Halal products. Research limitations/implications: The data collected for the current study investigate global attitude towards Halal products. It would be interesting if future researchers examine consumers' attitude towards specific Halal products for specific product categories. Practical implications: It is argued in this research that the presence of strong attitude towards Halal products in Muslim consumers might play an important role in exclusion or inclusion of brands, based on their conformance to Halal requirements. Originality/value: The paper extends the applicability of the theory of reasoned action model by investigating the role of inter-personal and intra-personal religiosity in intention to choose Halal products. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Brands; Consumer behaviour; Halal market; Islam; Islamic marketing; Selling to Islamic markets; The Muslim consumer","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84874338284"

Design/methodology/approach - The recent literature dealing with ways in which cultural dynamics are influencing the nature and meaning of culture are examined. Different perspectives of culture related to three key components of culture, intangibles, material culture and communication, are explored. Based on this, directions for research on the content of culture are discussed as well as how it should be approached. Findings - Culture is becoming increasingly deterritorialized and penetrated by elements from other cultures. This is resulting in cultural contamination, cultural pluralism and hybridization. It has become more difficult to study culture as it is becoming diffuse. At the same time, it is becoming more important to study it because of its pervasive influence on consumer behavior. Research limitations/implications - Given that culture is no longer a phenomenon defined by and isolated to a particular locale, research on culture must carefully specify the role of culture, define the appropriate unit of analysis, isolate confounding influences and expand the range of contexts. Originality/value - The parallel trends of globalization and multiculturalism make it increasingly important to develop a deeper understanding of culture and its various manifestations. For progress to be made, research designs must account for this complexity and span multiple contexts to establish the generality of findings. This will result in improved knowledge of culture and its role in molding consumption behavior. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Consumer behaviour; Cross-cultural studies; Globalization; National cultures","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-33744720116"

However, within CE debates and documentation, little is said about the social and political implications of such transformative agendas.

Satisfaction is a stronger predictor of customer engagement in high (vs. low) convenience, B2B (vs. B2C), and Twitter (vs. Facebook and Blogs). Twitter appears twice as likely as other social media platforms to improve customer engagement via satisfaction and positive emotions. Customer engagement is also found to have substantial value for companies, directly impacting firm performance, behavioral intention, and word-of-mouth. Moreover, hedonic consumption yields nearly three times stronger customer engagement to firm performance effects vis-à-vis utilitarian consumption.

Despite the general universality of the model, the cross-group analysis highlights that both subjective norm and perceived behavioral control exert stronger influences on Chinese consumers' behavioral intention than on American consumers. Moreover, the translation of green purchasing intention to corresponding behavior is found to be more effective in the American sample. These cross-group variances are likely to be attributed to cultural differences and discrepancies in the environmental development of the two nations, and would provide policy makers and green marketers useful insights into fine-tuning their pervasive and intervening strategies. © 2001 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

In particular, this study will examine the relationship between financial risk, product risk, security risk, time risk, social risk and psychological risk and online purchase intention. Design/methodology/approach: Survey method was used for the purpose of data collection, and quantitative analysis was used to test the hypotheses. A total of 350 respondents participated on an online survey, and data were quantitatively analyzed via IBM SPSS Statistics 24. Findings: The findings from this study suggest consumers’ perceived risks when they intend to purchase online. Five factors of perceived risk have a significant negative influence on consumer online purchase intention, while social risk was found to be insignificant. Among these factors, security risk is the main contributor for consumers to deter from purchasing online. Practical implications: This study provides useful information to online retailers in electronic commerce (e-commerce) activities. Previous studies show that many online retailers are still facing some risks in online business, and this will affect the transaction and performance of the retailers. It is hoped that the findings can help online retailers to formulate strategies to reduce risks in the online shopping environment, especially security risks for better e-commerce. Originality/value: The development of online shopping has led to some challenges to consumers, which comprise security of payment, data protection, the validity and enforceability of e-contract, insufficient information disclosure, product quality and enforcement of rights. This issue emerged because many online retailers do not understand the main factors that will contribute to consumers’ perceived risk. Consumers’ perceived risks will influence consumer attitudes toward online shopping and purchase behaviors. Studies on consumers’ perceived risks toward online purchase intentions are still inconclusive. Thus, this paper fills the gap in the research area. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","E-commerce; Online consumer behaviour; Online shopping; Quantitative research; Security","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85054485252"

Design/methodology/approach - Two studies were conducted using hedonic services. The study sample was composed of 400 visitors to two types of leisure and tourism services (interactive museum, and theme park). Findings - The results indicate that the impact of satisfaction is not limited to loyalty; rather its effects extend to other behavioral responses such as consumers' willingness to pay more for the service. Moreover, exceeding pre-purchase expectations amplifies consumers' on-the-spot behaviors such as souvenir purchases. The study findings also highlight the salience of emotions in understanding consumer responses to hedonic services. Specifically, pleasure is positively linked to both satisfaction and loyalty behaviors. Research limitations/implications - Future research should incorporate other measures tapping into consumers' on-the-spot behaviors; take into account different time frames, in order to measure the effects of consumer satisfaction in the period t+1; and use other types of hedonic services. Practical implications - Practical implications for pleasure-driven services, including most experiential services such as leisure and travel services, restaurants and ""hip"" retail outlets. Originality/value - This paper fulfils an identified need to study the relationships between emotional variables, consumer satisfaction and behavioral intentions. It develops a comprehensive model to analyze satisfaction and behavioral intentions in the context of hedonic services.

The study reviews the theoretical frameworks of innovation adoption and consumption, and cognitive and normative behaviour, relevant to consumer adoption of pro-environmental innovations, and develops a research framework. Through focus group discussions, a questionnaire survey with 103 respondents and an interview with 10 people, the study finds that consumers sympathetic to environmental issues do not necessarily adopt green electricity.

Design/methodology/approach: A critical review of literature is structured around the key components of brands, relationships, quality, emotions and perceptions, viewed from a consumer's perspective. Findings: Paradoxes in use of the term customer experience are noted. As a verb, experience describes a process of learning, leading to learned response, but as a noun emphasises novelty and the lack of predictable, learned response. By incorporating emotions and perceptual distortion over time, customer experience overcomes many problems associated with static, partial measures of service quality. Research limitations/implications: Academic coverage of the subject of customer experience remains fragmented. Approaches to its measurement are suggested and their limitations noted. The multi-dimensional, situation-specific nature of customer experience favours qualitative rather than quantitative measurement approaches. Practical implications: The unique nature of customer experience, which is specific to a customer, at a specific time and location, in the context of a specific event, limits its managerial usefulness for planning and control purposes. Many companies have seen customer experience management (CEM) as a successor to customer relationship management (CRM). However, issues of inter-functional integration become an even greater challenge.

A discussion on factors relating to corporate social responsibility initiatives as part of potential customers' banking selection criteria is also included. Design/methodology/approach - The paper presents primary data collected by self-administered questionnaires involving a sample of 750 respondents from four different regions in Malaysia. The Islamic banking criteria ranking as perceived by the respondents are analysed using Friedman Test. To further explore the customers' understanding of the banking criteria, an exploratory factor analysis is employed. Findings - This study reveals that the selection of Islamic banks appears to be predominantly a combination of Islamic and financial reputation and quality service offered by the bank. Other factors perceived to be important include good social responsibility practices, convenience and product price. Practical implications - The empirical evidence of this paper affects two aspects; first, Islamic banks must offer quality services while maintaining its Islamic credential and reputation; second, Islamic banks should also embrace good customers services policies to reap its potential as a strategic tool to achieve competitive advantage, enhance reputation and secure customers allegiance. This research will be of interest to both incumbent and potential entrants into this niche market.

But despite growing ecological awareness and articulated preferences for green products, renewable energies face slow rates of diffusion in consumer markets. This has been hard to explain given consumers' favorability to the concept of products that lower one's impact on the natural environment. This study uses data from 254 homeowners in Ireland to investigate the psychological process of adopting a renewable energy system - solar energy panels. Applying Behavioral Reasoning Theory (BRT), this research examines a proposed model in which reasons both for and against adopting solar panels mediate the relationship between consumers' attitudes, values and adoption intentions. Results suggest the model is generally supported with both reasons for adoption and reasons against adoption having countervailing influences in the psychological processing of adoption intentions. These findings suggest that researchers and marketers should include mediating constructs, such as (i) reasons for adoption, (ii) reasons against adoption, and (iii) attitudes toward a technology when attempting to explain how consumers think about the adoption of renewable energy systems. © The Author(s) 2013.","attitude-behavior gap; behavioral reasoning theory; diffusion of innovation; macromarketing; renewable energy; sustainability","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84891760532"

Instead, they expect the supply chain to work efficiently without interference, as if guided by Adam Smith's famed invisible hand. In their study of more than 50 supply networks, V.G. Narayanan and Ananth Raman found that companies often looked out for their own interests and ignored those of their network partners. Consequently, supply chains performed poorly. Those results aren't shocking when you consider that supply chains extend across several functions and many companies, each with its own priorities and goals. Yet all those functions and firms must pull in the same direction for a chain to deliver goods and services to consumers quickly and cost-effectively. According to the authors, a supply chain works well only if the risks, costs, and rewards of doing business are distributed fairly across the network. In fact, mis-aligned incentives are often the cause of excess inventory, stock-outs, incorrect forecasts, inadequate sales efforts, and even poor customer service. The fates of all supply chain partners are interlinked: If the firms work together to serve consumers, they will all win. However, they can do that only if incentives are aligned. Companies must acknowledge that the problem of incentive misalignment exists and then determine its root cause and align or redesign incentives. They can improve alignment by, for instance, adopting revenue-sharing contracts, using technology to track previously hidden information, or working with intermediaries to build trust among network partners. It's also important to periodically reassess incentives, because even top-performing networks find that changes in technology or business conditions alter the alignment of incentives.","","Commerce; Equipment and Supplies; Motivation; United States; apparatus, equipment and supplies; commercial phenomena; motivation; organization and management; review; United States","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-19644401287"

With increased pressure to accommodate this demand, researchers and marketers seek to understand how to influence a brand’s perceived authenticity. The purpose of this paper is to build a link between previous research on authenticity and thus gain a deeper understanding of the influencing factors of brand authenticity and its consumer outcomes. Design/methodology/approach: Building on an extensive literature review, the authors identify various antecedents of brand authenticity that are closely connected with the brand’s past, its virtuousness, consumers’ self-identification with the brand perceiver’s own self and individuals representing the brand, as well as relational outcomes as consequences of a brand’s perceived authenticity. As brand authenticity is a subjective construct, the authors include brand involvement to test for moderator effects. For data collection, they conduct an online survey that generates 509 datasets. To test the hypotheses, the authors use structural equation modeling. Findings: The results demonstrate that brand authenticity can be influenced by the identified variables (i.e. brand heritage, brand nostalgia, brand commercialization, brand clarity, brand’s social commitment, brand legitimacy, actual self-congruence and employee’s passion). Moreover, brand authenticity positively affects brand relationship quality, which in turn positively influences consumers’ behavioral intentions. The analyzed relationships do not vary due to consumer-specific characteristics (i.e. brand involvement). Originality/value: In sum, the results regarding the antecedents of brand authenticity demonstrate that a company can influence brand authenticity through different approaches, and that it is therefore important to analyze which of the identified antecedents brand management should manipulate to positively impact the perception of the brand’s authenticity. In addition, the findings confirm the positive consequences on consumer behavior ascribed to the authenticity concept by marketing literature. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Brand authenticity; Brand perception; Brand relationships; Branding","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85011011280"

The proposed model accommodates conjunctive, disjunctive, and compensatory screening rules. We estimate a model that reflects a discontinuous decision process by employing the Bayesian technique of data augmentation and using Markov-chain Monte Carlo methods to integrate over the parameter space.

The paper also seeks to provide insights into the impact of distribution policies on the adoption of new products. The model is intended to assist motion picture exhibitor chains (retailers) in managing their exhibition capacity and in negotiating exhibition license agreements with distributors (studios), by allowing them to project the box-office potential of the movies they plan to or currently exhibit based on early box-office results. It is also of interest to practitioners in other software industries (e.g., music, books, CD-ROMs) where the distribution intensity is highly variable over the product life cycle and is an important determinant of new product adoption patterns. The model and its extensions are of interest to academic researchers interested in modeling distribution effects in new product adoption, as well as forecasters looking for ways to leverage historical data on related products to forecast the sales of new products. We draw upon a queuing theory framework to conceptualize stochastically the consumer's movie adoption process in two steps - the time to decide to see the new movie, and the time to act on the adoption decision. The parameter for the time-to-decide process captures the intensity of information intensity flowing from various information sources, while the parameter for the time-to-act process is related to the delay created by limited distribution intensity and other factors. Our conceptualization extends existing new product forecasting models, which assume that consumers act instantaneously on the motivating information they receive about the new product. The resulting model is parsimonious, yet it accommodates a wide range of adoption patterns. In addition, the stochastic formulation allows us to quantify the uncertainty surrounding the expected adoption pattern. In the empirical testing, we focus on the most parsimonious version of the modeling framework, BOXMOD-I, a model that assumes stationarity with respect to the two shape parameters that characterize the adoption process. The model produces fairly accurate early forecasts using at most the first three weeks of data for calibration, and the predictive performance of the model compares favorably with benchmark models. We propose extensions of the basic model that account for more realistic non-stationary distribution intensity patterns - including a ""wide release"" pattern that relies on intensive distribution and promotion, and a ""platform release"" pattern that involves a gradual buildup of distribution intensity. Finally, we present an adaptive weighing scheme that combines initial parameter estimates obtained from a meta-analysis procedure with estimates obtained from early data to produce forecasts of box-office revenues for a new movie when little or no box-office data are available. An important finding from the empirical testing is that motion picture box-office revenue patterns display remarkable empirical regularity. We find that there are only three classes of adoption patterns, and these can all be represented within the basic model by using a two-parameter Exponential or Erlang-2 probability distribution, or a three parameter Generalized Gamma distribution. We also find that cumulative box-office revenues can be predicted with reasonable accuracy (often within 10% of the actual) using as little as two or three data points. However, our attempts to predict revenue patterns without any sales data meet with limited success. While the scale parameter can be estimated reasonably well from a historical database of parameter values, we find that it is considerably more difficult to predict the shape parameters using historical data. The parsimony we seek in developing the model comes at the cost of several limiting assumptions. We assume that the time-to-decide subprocess and the time-to-act subprocess are independent, which may not be the case if decisions on continued exhibition by retailers are endogenously related to box-office revenues over the life cycle. In the basic model formulation, we also assume that the time-to-act process can be represented by an exponential distribution, which may not always be the case. While we provide some empirical evidence to support these assumptions, further research could relax these and other assumptions to enrich the basic model, although this would entail some loss in parsimony.","Consumer behavior; Distribution; Forecasting; Motion pictures; Stochastic models","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-0030520919"

However, a recurring theme in the literature has been the attitude-behavior gap in green consumption. Taking the cognitive view in studying consumer behaviors, this study theoretically developed and tested two key moderators to the relationship between green consumption intention and behavior, namely green product availability and perceived consumer effectiveness. Under high levels of the moderators, the relationship between the intention and the behavior were hypothesized to be stronger. Our data sample of 416 consumers in two large cities in Vietnam provided support for the hypotheses. Our study results thus contribute to the green consumption literature by explaining the attitude-behavior gap. Our study also contributes to the broader literature by explaining the inconsistency in consumer behavior.

We consider the underlying motives for consumption and choice from an evolutionary perspective. We review evidence that deep-seated evolutionary motives continue to influence much modern behavior, albeit not always in obvious or conscious ways. These fundamental motives include: (1) evading physical harm, (2) avoiding disease, (3) making friends, (4) attaining status, (5) acquiring a mate, (6) keeping a mate, and (7) caring for family. We discuss how, why, and when these motives influence behavior, highlighting that many consumer choices ultimately function to help fulfill one or more of these evolutionary needs. An important implication of this framework is that a person's preferences, behaviors, and decision processes change in predictable ways depending on which fundamental motive is currently active. We discuss how consideration of evolutionary motives provides fertile ground for future consumer research, while also helping build bridges between consumer behavior, evolutionary biology, and other social sciences. © 2013 Society for Consumer Psychology.","Consumer behavior; Decision making; Evolutionary psychology; Motivation","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84878929659"

The empirical study is based on a choice-based conjoint analysis of preferences for functional drink products of a sample of 330 consumers using these products. Our choice-based approach on environmental behaviour brings new insights to previous research, which predominantly relies on attitude models. Results indicate that consumers differ in their preferences for packaging, brand, price and convenience of use of daily products. In addition, various distinctive consumer segments can be identified on the market. Contrary to several previous studies, we found that the largest consumer segment, one-third of consumers, favoured environmentally labelled packaging as the most important criteria in their choice. The findings emphasize the increasing importance of ethical and environmental dimension in product choices. We also propose that the attention in environmental consumer research should be shifted from general attitude studies towards the study of actual product choices. © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Conjoint analysis; Consumer preference; Environmental packaging and labels; Product choice; Segmentation","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-77952207755"

This paper solves and compares the equilibrium solutions of supply chains with several different structures. The results show that the vertical cooperation leads to higher carbon emission reduction rate and lower retail prices. Compared with the case that both two chains are decentralized, manufacturers' horizontal cooperation will damage retailers' profit and consumers' welfare. It is found that the revenue sharing contract provided by the retailers can effectively promote manufacturers to give up horizontal cooperation, which not only helps the retailer and the manufacturer achieve a win-win situation but also benefits the environment with the higher emission reduction rate. When the sharing ratio is in a certain interval, the revenue sharing contract can bring a higher supply chain profit than the case that both two chains are integrated. © 2017","Cap-and-trade; Consumer behavior; Game theory; Revenue sharing contract; Supply chain","Commerce; Consumer behavior; Costs; Economics; Emission control; Game theory; Manufacture; Profitability; Sales; Cap and trade; Carbon emission reductions; Competitive supply chains; Different structure; Emission reduction; Equilibrium solutions; Horizontal cooperations; Revenue sharing contracts; Supply chains","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85021200050"

We empirically validate the conceptual model for green (n = 453) and non-green (n = 473) consumers (i.e., consumers who engage in a set of pro-environmental behaviors for environmental reasons versus consumers who do not engage in these behaviors). Data are analyzed using structural equation modeling and multi-group analysis of the two groups. The results confirm the relevance of the determining factors in the model and show significant differences in eco-friendly product purchasing patterns between green and non-green consumers. Altruistic motives are more important for green than for non-green consumers. Negative ego-centric motives affect the purchase intentions of non-green consumers more than the intentions of green consumers, whereas the impact of negative motives on behavior is stronger for green than for non-green consumers. The first contribution of this paper is the development and testing of a parsimonious model of eco-friendly products purchasing that embraces both positive (altruistic and ego-centric) and negative (ego-centric) antecedents, which have been theoretically suggested in the past but have rarely been empirically tested together.

And a new category of products and services, including automobiles, apparel, food, wine, and spirits, has sprung into being to cater to it. That category is called new luxury. America's middle-market consumers are trading up to higher levels of quality and taste than ever before. Members of the middle market (those earning $50,000 and above annually) collectively have around $1 trillion of disposable income. And they will pay premiums of 20% to 200% for well-designed, well-engineered, and well-crafted goods that can't be found in the mass middle market and that have the artisanal touches of traditional luxury items. Most important, even when they address basic necessities, such goods evoke and engage consumers' emotions while feeding their aspirations for a better life. Supply-side forces are essential to the rise of new luxury. Like the consumers of their goods, entrepreneurs are better educated and more sophisticated about their customers than ever before. In addition, global sourcing, falling trade barriers and transportation costs, and rising offshore manufacturing standards are making possible the economical production of alluring products of high quality. Unlike old-luxury goods, new-luxury products can generate high sales volumes despite their relatively high prices. As a result, new-luxury companies are achieving levels of profitability and growth beyond the reach of their conventional competitors. Whether the item in question is a $6 Panera sandwich or a $30,000 Mercedes, new luxury is a formula that middle-market companies, facing erosion of their market share by high-end and low-end producers, can ill afford to ignore.","","Consumer Satisfaction; Economic Competition; Entrepreneurship; Humans; Income; Marketing; Mass Behavior; Product Line Management; United States; article; commercial phenomena; consumer; crowding; economic aspect; economics; hospital management; human; income; marketing; United States","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-1642285233"

We propose that the evaluation of experiences tends to be less comparative than that of material possessions, such that potentially invidious comparisons have less impact on satisfaction with experiences than with material possessions. Support for this contention was obtained in 8 studies. We found that participants were less satisfied with their material purchases because they were more likely to ruminate about unchosen options (Study 1); that participants tended to maximize when selecting material goods and satisfice when selecting experiences (Study 2); that participants examined unchosen material purchases more than unchosen experiential purchases (Study 3); and that, relative to experiences, participants' satisfaction with their material possessions was undermined more by comparisons to other available options (Studies 4 and 5A), to the same option at a different price (Studies 5B and 6), and to the purchases of other individuals (Study 5C).

However, research finds that consumers have a poor opinion of remanufactured products and are typically not prepared to adopt them. Thus, development of the circular economy is dependent upon deeper understanding of consumers’ attitudes and behaviors. Research typically considers either micro-level or macro-level factors when assessing consumer perceptions of remanufactured products. The current research incorporates macro-level factors of price, government incentives and environmental benefits with the moderating influence of micro-level consumer attitudes to examine consumers’ intention to switch from purchasing new products to remanufactured products. The findings suggest that a consumer's attitude toward remanufactured products is an important moderating factor predicting consumer switching behavior to remanufactured products.

Yet organic foods only partially benefit from this market environment, and their market share remains quite low despite high growth rates. The usual explanation for this discrepancy is that consumers are not willing to pay the price premium prompted by an organic claim. In this paper, we explore the reasons behind consumers' (un)willingness to pay for organic food and investigate whether it differs between virtue and vice food categories. The results indicate that in vice food categories, organic claims are associated with lower quality, which seems to be only partly compensated by higher prosocial benefits. The lower-quality perceptions translate into a decreased consumer willingness to pay (WTP). We supplement the empirical results with data on organic purchases in the Dutch food market. These data show that market shares of organic food are indeed lower for vice categories of organic food. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Consumer behavior; Environmentalism; Pricing; Retailing; Sustainability","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-80052554887"

The emergent literature on consumer brand engagement, largely conceptual, offers various definitions of the construct, though without much consensus. We offer a novel higher-order model of consumer brand engagement that we derive from organizational psychology. We adapt the concept of employee engagement and examine its factorial validity in a consumer-brand relationship context, defining consumer brand engagement as consumers' positive, fulfilling, brand-use-related state of mind that is characterized by vigor, dedication and absorption. We develop and empirically test a three-dimensional model of brand engagement, outlining relevant antecedents and outcomes. More importantly, we assess the managerial utility of consumer brand engagement by examining its impact on consumer loyalty intentions. We additionally compare the explanatory capability of brand engagement relative to traditional consumer judgments of value, quality and satisfaction. A survey of 408 mobile phone consumers from India provided data for empirical testing. The results support the three-dimensional factor structure of consumer brand engagement. Brand engagement not only exerts a significant impact on loyalty intentions, but also explains significantly more variation in the outcome in addition to the variation explained jointly by value, quality and satisfaction. Theoretically, we offer a holistic multi-dimensional measure of consumer brand engagement, and examine key nomological relationships. Managerially, we demonstrate the explanatory capability of brand engagement in explaining consumer loyalty intentions, offering a useful tool in the relationship-building repertoire of managers. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Absorption; Consumer brand engagement; Dedication; Loyalty; Vigor","India; conceptual framework; consumption behavior; empirical analysis; holistic approach; management; numerical model; theoretical study; three-dimensional modeling","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84927750315"

An experimental study was conducted to test three different constructs - perceived wait duration, emotional evaluation of the service environment and emotional response to the wait - as mediators between music and behavioral response to the service organization. Results of the study showed that, regardless of its valence, music ameliorates emotional evaluation of the service environment which in turn positively affects approach behavior towards the service organization. Furthermore, positively valenced music triggers a more positive emotional response to the wait and a stronger approach behavior towards the service organization than negatively valenced music. Although positively valenced music also increases perceived wait duration, the latter does not have a significant effect on consumers' behavioral response to the service organization. © 1997 New York University.

Marketing practitioners and academics are attempting to identify and understand green consumers and their needs, and to develop market offerings thet meet these needs. So far there is little consensus about the identity and nature of green consumers, except that they have been something of a disappointment to the marketers who have pursued them. These difficulties perhaps reflect the folly of trying to understand green consumption and green marketing by viewing it as simply a variation on conventional marketing. This article proposes some different ways of looking at green consumption and green marketing, which have the potential to prevent the hunt for the green consumer from deteriorating into a wild goose chase.

Recent reviews on the topic of the circular economy have indicated that cultural barriers are a significant factor hindering the diffusion of so-called 'circular' business models, particularly the lack of consumer-or user-acceptance. However, none of them has provided an overview of the existing literature addressing such issues that can help academics and practitioners better understand consumption considerations when addressing the circular economy. Motivated by these observations, this paper presents the results of a literature review that summarises and discusses insights from 111 articles in terms of the problem area, theoretical approaches, methods, and tools that have been used to collect and analyse data, the main issues, and identified research gaps. The results show that most of the existing scientific work on the circular economy and circular solutions addressing consumption has focussed on identifying factors that drive or hinder the consumption of circular solutions. A smaller but expanding set of articles has focussed on offering insights into the nature, meaning, and dynamics of consumption in the context of the circular economy. According to this set of articles, consumption in the circular economy is anonymous, connected, political, uncertain, and based on multiple values, not only utility. A smaller set of papers has explored the integration of user and consumer perspectives into design processes. Although these contributions are relevant, opportunities for further research are still open, particularly regarding socio-material and cultural aspects of consumption in the context of the circular economy, and the role of digitalisation. In addition, more work could be done regarding strategies to foster not only acceptance but also the adoption and diffusion of the circular economy. Based on the findings of this literature review, some ideas for a research agenda on the issue of consumption in the circular economy are outlined. © 2018 by the authors.","Circular economy; Collaborative consumption; Literature review; Product service systems; Remanufacturing; Sharing economy; Sustainable consumption","academic research; business development; commodity; consumption behavior; contingent valuation; economic activity; literature review; manufacturing; resource use; sustainable development; technology adoption","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85051111077"

The effect of repeated exposures to banner ads is negative and nonlinear, and the differential effect of each successive ad exposure is initially negative, though nonlinear, and levels off at higher levels of passive ad exposures. Further, significant correlations between session and consumer click proneness and banner exposure sensitivity suggest gains from repeated banner exposures when consumers are less click prone. For a particular number of sessions, more clicks are generated from consumers who revisit over a longer period of time, than for those with the same number of sessions in a relatively shorter timeframe. We also find that consumers are equally likely to click on banner ads placed early or late in navigation path and that exposures have a positive cumulative effect in inducing click-through in future sessions. Our results have implications for online advertising response measurement and dynamic ad placement, and may help guide advertising media placement decisions.","Advertising and Media Research; Clickstream Data; Computer-Mediated Environments; Internet; Online Consumer Behavior; Random-Coefficient Models; World Wide Web","","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0742306220"

However there is no review that has considered the effectiveness of interventions aimed at preventing food waste in the consumption stages of the food system. This significant gap, if filled, could help support those working to reduce food waste in the developed world, providing knowledge of what interventions are specifically effective at preventing food waste. This paper fills this gap, identifying and summarizing food-waste prevention interventions at the consumption/consumer stage of the supply chain via a rapid review of global academic literature from 2006 to 2017. We identify 17 applied interventions that claim to have achieved food waste reductions. Of these, 13 quantified food waste reductions. Interventions that changed the size or type of plates were shown to be effective (up to 57% food waste reduction) in hospitality environments. Changing nutritional guidelines in schools were reported to reduce vegetable waste by up to 28%, indicating that healthy diets can be part of food waste reduction strategies. Information campaigns were also shown to be effective with up to 28% food waste reduction in a small sample size intervention. Cooking classes, fridge cameras, food sharing apps, advertising and information sharing were all reported as being effective but with little or no robust evidence provided. This is worrying as all these methods are now being proposed as approaches to reduce food waste and, except for a few studies, there is no reproducible quantified evidence to assure credibility or success. To strengthen current results, a greater number of longitudinal and larger sample size intervention studies are required. To inform future intervention studies, this paper proposes a standardised guideline, which consists of: (1) intervention design; (2) monitoring and measurement; (3) moderation and mediation; (4) reporting; (5) systemic effects. Given the importance of food-waste reduction, the findings of this review highlight a significant evidence gap, meaning that it is difficult to make evidence-based decisions to prevent or reduce consumption-stage food waste in a cost-effective manner. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Consumer; Consumption; Downstream; Food waste; Household; Reduction","consumption behavior; decision making; food waste; guideline; monitoring; sustainable development; waste management","Review","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85061371018"

This paper attempts to empirically investigate how consumers who differ in terms of environmentalism respond to labels. Design/methodology/approach - The data were collected on an Australian sample using a structured questionnaire administered on the phone using quantum research (CATI) data collection services. A total of 155 questionnaires were completed and used for data analysis. The data were analysed using both descriptive measures and correlations between variables. Findings - There appears to be a proportion of consumers that find product labels hard to understand. The research found that there are consumers who will buy green products even if they are lower in quality in comparison to alternative products, but would look for environmental information on labels. With respect to price sensitive green consumers, there appears to be a relationship between price sensitivity and ""always"" reading labels as well as indicating that there is ""sufficient"" information on product labels to make informed purchase decisions. Research limitations/implications - It was beyond the scope of the research to account for some of the utilitarian approaches to interpretation or in-depth comprehension of label information. The sample size of 155, although selected using a probability method, may, to some extent, limit the overall accuracy of the results. Practical implications - The research offers some important information on different green consumer segments that would alert managers on how best to position environmental labels. Findings such as ""Satisfied with labels"" correlates with ""Labels are accurate"", which suggests that businesses need to provide a clear, accurate and easily legible label design to encourage satisfaction with the accuracy of content and the communication aspects of a label. Originality/value - The paper contributes to better understanding of green customers purchase intentions and the usefulness of ecological product labels. It offers some insights and assistance to businesses in planning their green product/labelling strategies. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Australia; Consumer behaviour; Environmental issues; Green marketing; Labelling","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-33645827566"

In addition, we present the results of three preliminary field studies that investigate factors that influence consumers' value assessments and bidding decisions.

Despite the greater interest in consumers' green behaviors, the theoretical application of the value-belief-norm (VBN) theory has been used only rarely to investigate consumers' intentions to visit a green hotel. The purpose of this study was to expand existing knowledge of hotel consumers' green behaviors by developing and testing an extended VBN theory used in the hospitality literature. More specifically, this study incorporated subjective norms and green trust into the original VBN model as a theoretical framework to understand comprehensively consumers' decision-making processes with respect to their intentions to visit a green hotel. A web-based survey was used to collect data from a convenience sample of faculty members working at an institution of higher education in the Midwestern United States who have been lodging consumers. Structural equation modeling was applied to test the hypotheses. The results showed that all but subjective norms were successful in explaining consumers' decision-making processes regarding their intentions to visit a green hotel. The results can assist hotel managers in the adoption and implementation of hotel operations based on the needs of environmentally conscious consumers. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Consumers' decision making; Green consumers; Green trust; Lodging industry; Subjective norm; VBN theory","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84941648068"

Communication, however, often remains the missing link in the practice of corporate responsibility. The information requirements of a range of opinion leader and mass stakeholder audiences are not currently being satisfied by many companies, so they are not getting full credit for their responsible corporate behaviour. Of course, there are specific challenges in communicating corporate responsibility – including scepticism towards company messages and potentially hostile reactions from the media, campaign groups and others. The diverse information requirements of different stakeholder groups also present special communication challenges, and these requirements are examined in turn. Using MORI’s British opinion research to illustrate the case, this paper first examines communication to opinion leader audiences (such as legislators, business press, investors and non-governmental organisations), and in particular the opportunities and limitations of the social report. It then goes on to address communication of corporate responsibility to the general public and the need to trigger wider consumer engagement in this topic. Lastly, it covers the communication opportunity presented by companies’ own employees and the internal communication challenges surrounding corporate responsibility. The paper suggests, in conclusion, that effective communication of corporate responsibility depends on a clear strategy which evaluates both the opportunities and the risks to the brand, and which tailors messages to different stakeholder groups. It calls for a coordinated approach, which ideally embeds corporate responsibility messages into mainstream communications. The paper also identifies internal communication as an under-utilised and potentially powerful channel for enhancing a company’s reputation for responsibility among its key stakeholders. © 2004, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Corporate citizenship; Corporate social responsibility; Employee volunteering; Ethical consumerism; Internal communications; Stakeholder opinion","","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84992933828"

Moreover, these theories have minimal influence on autonomously motivated behaviours. Despite these limitations, marketing scientists have overwhelmingly applied these theories to predict consumer intention and behaviour. However, theories that are actually capable of explaining consumers’ motivations have been surprisingly ignored in the marketing literature; for instance, ‘self-determination theory’ (SDT) is a leading theory of human motivation that has been proven effective at identifying the contingencies that affect motivation and behaviour. Therefore, the goal is to review the marketing research in which SDT is used. To this end, we review all empirical studies published on the subject over a 20-year period. Several clusters of research are identified in which SDT appears to be more promising in addressing marketing problems.

The present paper seeks to explore the factors that are likely to enhance the chances that receivers of positive word of mouth might be influenced by such information. Design/methodology/approach - The study examines findings from six focus group discussions and 103 critical incident forms. Findings - The findings suggest that the potential for WOM to impact on perceptions or on actions depends on the nature of the sender-receiver relationship, the richness and strength of the message and its delivery, and various personal and situational factors. Research limitations/implications - The findings are tentative and based on a relatively small sample; however, they provide a useful framework for future research into the process of WOM. Practical implications - The importance of WOM in marketing, particularly professional services marketing, is widely accepted; however, little is known about how to enhance its occurrence. The paper provides marketing managers with a better understanding of the factors likely to influence receivers of WOM. Originality/value - Most WOM research focuses on the sender of WOM. In contrast this paper provides insights on the impact of WOM on the receiver, something that is currently a ""black box"" in the marketing literature. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Consumer behaviour; Consumers; Services marketing","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-41649110633"

Working under this premise, we examine the effects of viral messages containing the six primary emotions (surprise, joy, sadness, anger, fear, and disgust) on recipients' emotional responses to viral marketing campaigns and subsequent forwarding behavior. According to our findings, in order to be effective, viral messages need to contain the element of surprise. By itself, however, surprise is not enough to guarantee message success; therefore, it must be combined with other emotions. The effectiveness of the viral message is also moderated by gender, with disgust-based and fear-based campaigns being more likely to be forwarded by male recipients than female recipients. To ensure forwarding behavior, the message must capture the imagination of the recipient, as well as be clearly targeted. Moreover, achieving fit between a campaign and the featured emotions is important, as this ensures an increased chance of forwarding. In addition to relaying these and other findings, we share and discuss the managerial implications of using different emotions in viral marketing campaigns.

At the same time, consumption has often been dichotomized in terms of its functional-hedonic nature and has been examined with regard to social influence. Surprisingly, researchers have heretofore not examined the potential effect of the consumption occasion or social context on consumers' price sensitivity. Further, research examining the effect of household resources on price sensitivity has produced mixed results. We argue that household income effects on price sensitivity are dependent upon the situation. This research addresses two key issues. First, we examine whether individuals are equally price-sensitive when purchasing products for functional (e.g., purchasing frozen vegetables or paper towels) versus hedonic (e.g., purchasing ice cream or cookies) consumption situations and whether social context (i.e., consuming the product alone or with others) influences price sensitivity. Second, we explore the interaction effects of household income and consumption context on price sensitivity. We examine these issues across a series of three studies, finding that consumers' price sensitivity is in fact attenuated by both hedonic and social consumption situations and that income moderates these effects.

The present research was designed to explore 1 potential explanation for this result, namely, that experiences tend to be more closely associated with the self than possessions. The authors first show that people tend to think of their experiential purchases as more connected to the self than their possessions. Compared with their material purchases, participants drew their experiential purchases physically closer to the self (Study 1), were more likely to mention them when telling their life story (Study 2), and felt that a purchase described in terms of its experiential, rather than its material, qualities would overlap more with their sense of who they are (Study 4). Participants also felt that knowing a person's experiential purchases, compared with their material purchases, would yield greater insight into that person's true self (Studies 3A-3C).

This paper uses a consumer-oriented perspective to derive functional requirements for e-store design. These needs are grouped into three categories: motivation, hygiene, and media richness. An empirical study was conducted on three on-line bookstores to evaluate the relative importance of these factors. The results show that the quality of e-store design has an effect on the consumer purchase decision. Consumers are more likely to shop at well-designed websites. Among the on-line functions, support of transaction and post-sales services play key roles. Hygiene factors are critical when consumers decide whether to shop electronically, while motivational factors play a key role when consumers choose among different electronic stores. Media richness factors are, in general, least important. The implication of the findings is that providing good transactional support and post-sales services to the customer is the key. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Differentiation among retailers in price and nonprice service factors is a central feature of markets ranging from automobiles and appliances to gasoline and is especially observed in the coexistence of high-service retailers and lower price discount retailers. Therefore, how a manufacturer should manage retail differentiation is an important channel management question. Yet, the approach in the existing literature has been to examine channel coordination under the standard ""symmetric contracting"" assumption that offering a uniform contract to all the retailers in a market will be sufficient for coordination. I bring this assumption into question and ask when is it optimal for the manufacturer to use the channel contract to deliberately induce retail differentiation (even if the retailers were ex-ante identical in their cost and other characteristics). The paper identifies the type of channel contracts that can endogenously induce symmetry as opposed to differentiation among retailers. Next, the paper highlights a type of channel conflict that arises from the very nature of retail price-service competition. A manufacturer might find the retailers to be excessively biased towards price competition at the cost of service provision or vice-versa. The paper establishes when a manufacturer is likely to stimulate greater price as opposed to greater service competition among the retailers. The framework that I develop to address these issues high-lights the role of two basic types of consumer heterogeneity. Consumers are heterogeneous in their locations (as in the spatial models of horizontal differentiation) and in their willingness to pay for retail services (as in the models of vertical differentiation). The model also uses a natural relationship in retail markets between the travel/time cost incurred by a consumer and her willingness to pay: The more affluent consumers who have a higher willingness to pay for retail services also have a higher cost for their personal time. Given these market features, the paper analyzes the problem faced by a manufacturer who sells to competing retailers. The paper shows that the standard notion in the literature of offering similar contracts to all the retailers is sufficient only in markets with substantial locational differentiation relative to the differences in the willingness to pay. Effective channel management in these markets simply requires mechanisms that ensure that retailer interests are aligned so that they compete by offering a mix of price and service that is desirable from the manufacturer's point of view. However, in markets with small locational differentiation and substantial diversity in consumer willingness to pay, the manufacturer's problem is not just to align retailer interests, but to also use the channel contract to induce the correct level of retail differentiation. This helps the manufacturer to better cater to the diversity in consumer willingness to pay and to prevent the cut-throat competition that the retailers would otherwise have indulged in. The manufacturer can achieve this through the use of menu-based contracts. Menu-based contracts induce differentiated retailer behavior despite the fact that the retailers are not ""forced"" into accepting different terms of trade. This aspect can be useful in shielding manufacturers from litigation under the Robinson-Patman act. The paper also shows that for relatively high-ticket items retailers tend to be excessively biased towards competing in the provision of retail services. The correlation between consumer willingness to pay for service and travel costs implies that for high-ticket products, the competing retailers will focus on the more service-sensitive customers at the cost of ignoring the price-sensitive consumers in the market. The manufacturer is therefore likely to encourage greater price competition among the retailers. In contrast, for low-ticket items the manufacturer prefers to reduce price competition and encourage greater provision of services. This provides an endogenous rationale for the use of price ceilings versus floors. The basic model is also extended to consider the effect of upstream competition between manufacturers. Under upstream competition, coordinating retail price and service decisions is not always optimal for an individual manufacturer. This extension to manufacturer competition provides a basis for understanding the role of retail price-service differentiation in the context of a channel duopoly. It also shows that a mixed distribution channel (a channel in which one manufacturer chooses to be coordinated while the other chooses to be noncoordinated) can be an equilibrium in markets with weak brand loyalty.","Channel coordination; Consumer heterogeneity; Menu-based contracts; Retail differentiation; Retail services","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0032237541"

Thus, any strategy to meaningfully combat food wastage must put the end consumer in the center of prevention activities. This requires deeper insights into people's motivations to discard still edible food and knowledge about potential barriers to reduce wasting. This paper reports on results of an online survey among two European research centers in Italy (JRC/Ispra) and Germany (KIT/Karlsruhe). The focus of the survey was on households' behaviors (shopping, eating, and food preparation habits) and its influence on the generation of food waste. Furthermore, reasons for the disposal of food as well as measures and technologies most needed to prevent wastage were discussed. The results of the survey are analyzed, especially with regard to two questions: (1) Are there considerable differences between Ispra and Karlsruhe? (2) Are there considerable similarities or inconsistencies with the results of previous studies. © 2015 by the authors.","Consumer behavior; Food waste; Households; Survey","Germany; Italy; domestic waste; environmental economics; European Union; household survey","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84926378283"

In this study, a conceptual model is proposed that integrates the research on the environmental perspective oj service experiences with the standard satisfaction model. An experiment was conducted to test a part of this model. It was found that, as hypothesized, confirmation/disconfirmation has a direct and positive effect on pleasure, and both, in turn, have direct and positive effects on satisfaction.

The reasons inhibiting mature consumers' mobile banking adoption were compared to those of younger consumers. Design/methodology/approach - Following Ram and Sheth, resistance was measured with five barriers namely Usage, Value, Risk, Tradition and Image barriers. An extensive internet survey was implemented and 1,525 usable responses were collected, of which 370 respondents (24.3 percent) represented the mature consumer segment (age over 55) and 1,155 respondents (75.7 percent) represented the younger consumers. Findings - The empirical findings indicate that the value barrier is the most intense barrier to mobile banking adoption among both mature and younger consumers. However, aging appears to be related especially to the risk and image barriers; the most significant differences between mature and younger consumers' perceptions of mobile banking were related to input and output mechanisms of information, the battery life of a mobile phone, a fear that the list of PIN codes would be lost and end up in the wrong hands and the usefulness of new technology in general. Practical implications - The study has practical implications to marketers in different fields in that strategies to overcome resistance to innovations like mobile banking are discussed. Originality/value - Innovation resistance can be seen as a less developed concept in adoption research. While the majority of studies have focused on the success of innovations and reasons to adopt, this study empirically investigates the reasons preventing innovation adoption. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Banks; Consumer behaviour; Innovation; Mobile communication systems; Older consumers","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-36248987875"

Specifically, it examines the perception of ""justice"" in service recovery and how it affects the level of satisfaction and behavioral outcomes. In addition, the study also explores whether the ""recovery paradox"" exists. Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected through a survey using a structured questionnaire. The 428 respondents were analyzed according to whether they did or did not make a complaint to the service providers. Findings - The findings showed that the complainants' level of satisfaction with service recovery was significantly affected by perceived justice. The behavioral outcomes of the complainants in terms of trust, word-of-mouth (WOM) and loyalty were also found to be affected by their satisfaction with the service recovery. T-tests confirmed that the levels of trust, WOM and loyalty were significantly higher for those respondents who were satisfied with the service recovery compared with those who were dissatisfied. Further t-tests also indicated that respondents who were initially satisfied with the service expressed greater trust and positive WOM compared with the satisfied complainants. Finally, the study showed that dissatisfied complainants would exhibit a lower level of trust and were more likely to engage in negative word-of-mouth behavior compared with those who were dissatisfied initially but chose not to complain. Practical implications - The findings in this paper confirmed the importance of perceived justice in service recovery. Satisfaction with service recovery also leads to a higher level of trust, positive word-of-mouth behavior and, to a lesser extent, the level of loyalty. Finally, the lack of support of the ""recovery paradox"" effect suggests that successful service recovery alone would not bring customer satisfaction to pre-service failure levels. It is therefore essential to provide service right at the first time. Originality/value - This is a new study on the service provided by mobile phone service providers in an Asian environment. It also reinforces the important of perceive justice in service recovery and debunks the existence of the ""recovery paradox"" effect. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Complaints; Customer satisfaction","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-33745851120"

In contrast, extending past research showing that powerlessness fosters a compensatory motive to restore power; we demonstrate that the powerless prefer visible or conspicuous consumption that signals status to others. Regardless of whether high and low power were measured, episodically primed, or structurally manipulated, and regardless of how consumption patterns were measured (e.g., purchasing intentions, consumer attitudes, or creation of one's own advertising slogan), five experiments support a parsimonious model for how different levels of power impact consumer behavior. Given the pervasiveness of everyday fluctuations in power, and the governing role of consumption in everyday life, these findings have potentially broad implications, from tailored advertising to different market segments to understanding the rise in consumer debt. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

To provide guidelines for these decisions, this research proposes and tests a conceptual framework linking the hue, chroma, and value of the color(s) in an ad to consumers' feelings and attitudes. In an experimental study, the three dimensions of color used in an ad are manipulated using a between-subjects design. The results support the hypotheses that ads containing colors with a higher level of value lead to greater liking for the ad, and this effect is mediated by the greater feelings of relaxation elicited by the higher value color. Feelings play an equally important role in the effect of chroma. Consistent with the hypotheses, higher levels of chroma elicit greater feelings of excitement, which in turn increase ad likeability. A follow-up study found that although managers often select higher value and higher chroma colors, in a large number of cases they do not. The findings of both studies are integrated in our discussion of the importance of value and chroma in increasing the range of options available to a manager faced with the selection of colors in an ad.","Advertising and Media; Buyer Behavior; Marketing","Color; Decision making; Design; Three dimensional; Buyer behavior; Executional cue; Marketing","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0031249984"

Such decision situations (i.e. product choice in categories with no domestic alternative) are common for consumers in many smaller countries throughout Europe, and thus important for marketing managers to understand. It was hypothesised that individuals with high levels of consumer ethnocentrism would have more favourable attitudes toward products from culturally similar countries in comparison to products from culturally dissimilar countries.

Design/methodology/approach - The study integrates the technology acceptance model (TAM) and adoption of innovation framework to develop predictions of online banking acceptance. It distinguishes between innate consumer innovativeness, a generalized personality trait, and internet-domain-specific or actualized innovativeness in order to explore consumer characteristics' impact on adoption. Data are analyzed using logistic regression. Findings - While results confirm the positive relationship between internet related innovativeness and online banking they also surprisingly show that general innovativeness is negatively related to online banking. Research limitations/implications - Results may or may not differ according to whether consumers are using online, telephone banking, electronic funds transfer (EFT) or direct bill payment. Our results may generalize to telephone banking and EFT as these products, like online banking, require an active consumer role in using the product. With direct bill payment, consumers need only set up the process initially and then monitor it on a semi-regular basis. Practical implications - Findings suggest that the type of consumer innovation matters in understanding the adoption of e-banking processes. This supports the notion that online shoppers are distinct from traditional non-online shoppers or highlight the unique nature of purchasing financial versus non-financial products. Banks offering e-banking need to recognize the importance of internet-specific consumer innovation characteristics. Originality/value - This paper closes a research gap as the model tested provides insights toward understanding the consumer-based phenomenon of e-banking, and serves to evaluate the TAM in this context. In contrast to previous research the study utilized an actual measure of e-banking adoption versus a measure of intention to use the technology. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Banking; Consumer behaviour; Electronic commerce; Innovation","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-18844363978"

The policies and policy aspects considered in this paper broadly fall into three categories: physical policies, soft policies, and knowledge policies. All three aim to bring about changes in consumers' and firms' behaviour, but in different ways. The first category includes policies with a physical infrastructure element: public transport, land use, walking and cycling, road construction, and freight transport. We also consider the particular challenges for mobility in developing countries, and how these may be addressed. Soft policies, on the other hand, are non-tangible aiming to bring about behavioural change by informing actors about the consequences of their transport choices, and potentially persuading them to change their behaviour. These measures include car sharing and car pooling, teleworking and teleshopping, eco-driving, as well as general information and advertising campaigns. Finally, knowledge policies emphasise the important role of investment in research and development for a sustainable model of mobility for the future. The main findings can be summarised as follows. Physical policies: An increase in the use of public transport, combined with a decrease in the use of private cars, can reduce traffic congestion and, more importantly, carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, as public transport generally causes lower CO2 emissions per passenger kilometre than private cars. Public transport fares are subsidised in most places, which can be justified by economies of scale and by the fact that public transport can reduce total road transport externalities. London, Singapore, Portland and Curitiba are all examples of good practice at government level, having achieved reliable, frequent and integrated public transport. Policies to increase public transport use must be part of an integrated policy. Integrated policy refers to integration across different modes of transport, different government objectives (such as the economy, health and the environment), considering the needs of different social groups, and coordinating action between the relevant government institutions. There is evidence that a lack of coordination can jeopardise the achievement of policy objectives. A sustainable model for transport policy also requires integration with land-use policies. These may be somewhat limited within the bounds of existing cities, but as cities grow and new cities are built, urban planners must put more emphasis on land use for sustainable transport in order to reduce congestion and CO2 emissions. Sustainable land-use policy can direct urban development towards a form that allows public transport as well as walking and cycling to be at the core of urban mobility. Walking and cycling, which improve general health and produce no tailpipe emissions, constitute an excellent alternative to motorised transport on short-distance trips within towns and cities. The policies which can incentivise walking and cycling include crime reduction to make streets safer, well-maintained and clean pavements, attractive street furniture, safe crossings with shorter waiting times, dedicated cycle paths, showers in offices, and lower speed limits, to name but a few. Road construction and expansion used to be seen as one of the most promising ways to reduce traffic congestion. However, in the mid-1990s, the issue was reassessed and it was found that building and expanding roads, increased, rather than decreased, congestion, and ultimately induced higher levels of travel demand. The reason for this is that the extra capacity reduces the general cost of travelling and the less expensive the travel, the more it will be demanded. Regarding freight modal shift, road transport is much more polluting than rail per tonne-km of goods transported and therefore a shift towards greater use of rail in freight transport is desirable. Inadequate infrastructure is the main obstacle preventing this modal shift taking place. Developing countries face great mobility challenges: rural areas are often extremely poorly connected to transport infrastructure, such that, in contrast to the situation in developed countries, the benefits of road construction can strongly outweigh the total costs (including environmental ones). The main challenge, however, is to develop a solution to the problems arising from the combination of urbanisation and motorisation. Integration of transport and land-use policy will be key to rising to this challenge. Soft policies: Car sharing and car clubs can also potentially reduce CO2 emissions, although the aggregate reduction in congestion and emissions has not been measured with an adequate degree of precision in the literature. Teleworking and teleshopping can potentially reduce congestion and also CO2 emissions. However, the evidence for this reduction is rather mixed, as it is unclear whether these measures lead to overall reductions in road transport. Eco-driving campaigns aim to inform and educate drivers in order to induce them to drive in a fuel-efficient and thus environmentally friendly way. There seems to be some consensus in the literature that eco-driving could lead to reductions in CO2 emissions of around 10 per cent. Information and education policies have often been advocated as instruments which may affect behavioural change. We find in this paper that these types of measures are necessary, but not sufficient for behavioural change. Advertising and marketing may go a long way in changing peoples' behaviour. In California, for example, Kahn (2007) finds the ""Prius"" effect: the Toyota Prius is preferred by consumers relative to other similarly green vehicles, probably due to extensive marketing and celebrity endorsements. Family life changes are also found to trigger changes in behaviour (Goodwin, 1989, 2008). People whose lives are being changed by some important development (birth of a child, retirement, etc) tend to respond more to changes in the relative attractiveness of different transport modes. Advertising campaigns promoting a modal shift towards public transport, for instance, may thus be more successful if targeted at people in the process of important life transitions. Knowledge policies: Research and Development is crucial for developing sustainable and low-carbon transport for the future, and it is essential that governments provide incentives to undertake R&D, so that new low-carbon technologies in the transport sector can be demonstrated and applied at a large scale. Finally, we consider the issue of policy combination and integration. There is evidence that the combination and integration of policies can lead to positive side-effects and synergies. Policy integration is crucial in order to rise to the challenges we face in moving towards a sustainable mobility model. We conclude that classical economic policies may be successfully combined with a number of policy measures discussed in this paper in order to achieve sustainability in transport. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

This article attempts to shed light on this paradox by drawing on qualitative data from in-depth interviews. The findings show that the evaluation of CSR initiatives is a complex and hierarchically structured process, during which consumers distinguish between core, central, and peripheral factors. This article describes these factors in detail and explains the complexity of consumers' assessment of CSR. These insights then serve as a basis for discussing the theoretical and managerial implications of the research findings.

Therefore, consumers' clothing consumption behavior needs to be shifted towards a more sustainable one. While green purchase behavior in general is well understood, research still lacks a comprehensive approach to explain consumers' purchase behavior of sustainable clothing. To provide a holistic framework which determines the main antecedents of purchase behavior of sustainable clothing and further, to shed light on the gap between purchase intention and subsequent purchase behavior of such clothes, we extended the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) approach with well-established constructs from green literature (i.e., perceived environmental knowledge and environmental concerns) and novel constructs derived from prior exploratory findings (i.e., greenwashing concerns, perceived economic risk, and perceived aesthetic risk). Four hundred sixty-four participants were inquired to assess these constructs in the context of sustainable clothing. Our findings indicate that attitude towards sustainable clothing has the highest impact on purchase intention. However, this relation is negatively influenced by consumers' greenwashing concerns. Moreover, we find evidence that consumers’ perceived aesthetic risk negatively impacts the intention-behavior relation, whereas perceived economic risk has no significant effect on this relation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Intention-behavior gap; Purchase behavior; Purchase intention; Sustainability; Sustainable clothing consumption; Theory of reasoned action","Garment industry; Purchasing; Sales; Sustainable development; Textile industry; Billion cubic meters; Consumption levels; Environmental concerns; Environmental footprints; Environmental knowledge; Holistic frameworks; Purchase intention; Theory of reasoned action; Consumer behavior","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85090247676"

Scanner panel operators routinely report these ""brand performance measures"" (BPMs) to their clients. In this position paper, we consider how to understand, interpret, and use these measures. The measures are shown to follow well-established patterns. One is that big and small brands differ greatly in how many buyers they have, but usually far less in how loyal these buyers are. The Dirichlet model predicts these patterns. It also provides a broader framework for thinking about all competitive repeat-purchase markets-from soup to gasoline, prescription drugs to aviation fuel, where there are large and small brands, and light and heavy buyers, in contexts as diverse as the United States, United Kingdom, Japan, Germany, and Australasia. Numerous practical uses of the framework are illustrated: auditing the performance of established brands, predicting and evaluating the performance of new brands, checking the nature of unfamiliar markets, of partitioned markets, and of dynamic market situations more generally (where the Dirichlet provides theoretical benchmarks for price promotions, advertising, etc.). In addition, many implications for our understanding of consumers, brands, and the marketing mix logically follow from the Dirichlet framework. In repeat-purchase markets, there is often a lack of segmentation between brands and the typical consumer exhibits polygamous buying behavior (though there might be strong segmentation at the category level). An understanding of these applications and implications leads to consumer insights, imposes constraints on marketing action, and provides norms for evaluating brands and for assessing marketing initiatives. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

Findings - Based on the most common associations of the terms in the literature, the paper proposes a hierarchical interrelationship between the terms in that: flexibility is most commonly associated with the inherent property of systems which allows them to change within pre-established parameters; agility is predominantly used to describe an approach to organizing that provides for rapid system reconfiguration in the face of unforeseeable changes; and responsiveness commonly refers to a system behavior involving timely purposeful change in the presence of modulating stimuli.

The literature about cancer-related information focuses on active and purposeful information seeking, but a great deal of exposure to cancer-relevant information may happen less purposively (termed information scanning). This article presents results from an in-depth interview study that examined information seeking and scanning behavior in the context of cancer prevention and screening decisions among a diverse sample of people living in a major metropolitan area. Results suggest that information scanning is quite common, particularly for information related to screening tests. Information seeking is rarer and occurs primarily among those who also are information scanners. Respondents report using a greater variety of sources for information scanning than for information seeking, but participants were much more likely to report that their decisions were influenced by information received through seeking than through scanning. These findings shed new light on how individuals navigate the media environment and suggest future research should examine predictors and effects of less purposeful efforts to obtain cancer-related information.

Thanks to an original European survey on seafood product carried out on more than 5000 consumers, we test the influence of intrinsic motivation, information, localization and socio-economic factors on the demand for an eco-label for fish. Our results show a significant connection between the desire for eco-labeling and seafood features, especially the freshness of the fish, the geographical origin of the fish and the wild vs farmed origin of the fish. Moreover, we prove the major role played by the fish price. We also demonstrate that the ecological issue regarding fisheries is highly connected to consumer information, intrinsic motivation and socio-economic status: the typical ""green fish consumer"" is a young woman, well educated, well informed on the state of marine resources and not very trusting of the regulation of the fisheries.

Throughout the years, researchers from different fields have proposed conceptual models addressing factors influencing the food choice, recognized as a key leverage to improve planetary and human health. However, a multidisciplinary approach is needed to better understand how different factors are involved and interact with each other in the decision-making process. The present paper reviews and analyzes existing models, providing an intact point-of-view by integrating key elements into a bigger framework. Key determinants of general food choice are identified and categorized, including food-internal factor (sensory and perceptual features), food-external factors (information, social environment, physical environment), personal-state factors (biological features and physiological needs, psychological components, habits and experiences), cognitive factors (knowledge and skills, attitude, liking and preference, anticipated consequences, and personal identity), as well as sociocultural factors (culture, economic variables, political elements). Moreover, possible directions of influence among the factors towards final food choice were discussed. The need of multidisciplinary impulses across research field with the support of empirical data are crucial for understanding factors influencing food choice as well as for enriching existing conceptual models. The framework proposed here would serve as a roadmap for facilitating communications and collaborations between research fields in a structural and systematic way. © 2020 by the authors.

In this paper, we argue that social capital is multifaceted and its relationship with health is complex. We explore the relationship between a number of elements of neighbourhood life and neighbourhood-based social capital, and health, using both qualitative and quantitative methods. The paper reports on a study of the Western suburbs of Adelaide and the analysis of 2400 questionnaires and 40 in-depth interviews. A partial least-square path analysis was undertaken with the questionnaire data. It considered the impact of perceptions of the physical environment, neighbourhood connections, neighbourhood trust, reciprocity, perceived safety and local civic action, and a number of demographic variables, on physical and mental health as measured by the SF-12. Of the neighbourhood-related variables, only perceived neighbourhood safety was related to physical health, with neighbourhood safety and neighbourhood connections related to mental health. Of the demographic variables, higher-income level and educational achievement were related to better physical and mental health. In addition, physical health was lower and mental health higher within older age groups. The inter-relationships between the neighbourhood variables and demographic differences in experience of neighbourhood were also examined. The thematic analysis of the interviews linked a number of social aspects of neighbourhood, the physical neighbourhood environment, perceptions of safety, civic activities and availability of local services, to health outcomes. The paper concludes that there is a need for more complex measures of social capital and that socio-economic factors are of relatively greater importance in determining health. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

This study reports the results of a nationwide survey of more than 1800 U.S. consumers who completed a choice experiment in which they selected among conventional beef and three alternative burger patties, (lab-grown, plant-based with pea protein, and plant-based with animal-like protein) at different prices. Respondents were randomly allocated to treatments that varied in the presence/absence of brands and information about the competing alternatives. Results from random parameter logit models indicate that, holding prices constant and conditional on choosing a food product, 72% chose farm-raised beef and 28% chose one of the alternatives: 16% plant-based (pea protein) meat alternative, 7% plant-based (animal-like protein) meat alternative, and 5% lab-grown meat. Adding brand names (Certified Angus Beef, Beyond Meat, Impossible Foods, and Memphis Meats) increased the share for choosing farm-raised beef to 80%. Environment and technology information had minor effects on conditional market shares but reduced the share of people not buying any options, indicating information pulled more people into the market. Even if plant- and lab-grown alternatives experienced significant (e.g., 50%) price reductions, farm-raised beef maintains the majority market share. Vegetarians, males, younger, and more highly educated individuals tend to have relatively stronger preferences for the plant- and lab-grown alternatives relative to farm-raised beef.

To better promote supply chain emission reduction, this paper analyzes the carbon emission transfer and emission reduction problem among enterprises within the supply chain, integrating the influence of government emission reduction policies and the low carbon market. Considering the lag time of emission reduction technologies and the low-carbon preferences of consumers, a Stackelberg differential game model (dominated by manufacturers) is constructed under both centralized and decentralized decisions. The results suggest that the lag time of emission reduction technology and the low carbon preference of consumers positively affect the carbon emission transfer level of manufacturers, while not affecting suppliers’ undertaking levels. Only when the lag time of emission reduction technology remains within a specific range, will an increase in consumers’ low-carbon preferences exert a positive impact on supply chain profits. Notably, under decentralized decision-making, when the emission reduction technology lag time and consumers’ low carbon preference remain within a specific range, the carbon emission transfer behavior exerts a positive promoting effect on the emission reduction of the supply chain. This applies when the profit of the supply chain increases and the carbon emission reduction per unit of product decreases. This result provides a new idea for the government to control irrational carbon emission transfer behavior of enterprises. Moreover, considering the lag time of emission reduction technology is also conducive to increasing the acceptability of government carbon quota. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Differential game; Lag time; Low-carbon preference; Low-carbon supply chain","Consumer behavior; Customer satisfaction; Decision making; Emission control; Manufacture; Profitability; Supply chains; Carbon emission reductions; Decentralized decision making; Emission reduction; Emission reduction policies; Low-carbon supply chains; Stackelberg differential games; Supply chain emissions; Transfer strategies; Carbon","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85083509347"

Our approach introduces a new and parsimonious way of looking at satisfaction that combines the literature on post-choice valuation with research regarding generalized expected utility theory. While the post-valuation literature focuses on the selected brand as the valuation's basis (e.g., Anderson and Sullivan 1993, Bolton and Drew 1991), we draw on a stream of research in generalized expected utility theory that considers both chosen and forgone alternatives as the basis for valuation (e.g., Bell 1983, 1985; Loomes and Sugden 1982, 1986). The result is a combined model of post-choice valuation that explicitly incorporates both concepts. Specifically, we extend the existing paradigm of post-choice valuation to include buyers' regret concerning for-gone alternatives, proposing a generalized utility theory-based treatment of post-choice product assessment that uses the intuitively appealing concepts of disappointment and regret as the basis. We propose a model for conceptualizing post-choice valuation that is consistent with the existing literature, discuss how this model extends the construct to consider the influence of forgone alternatives, and report results of an empirical test that contrasts our model to important recent work in the area (e.g., Boulding et al. 1993). Our generalized model of post-choice valuation is based on the sum of three components that represent factors that may contribute to consumers' assessment of a chosen product or service. The first component is expected performance. The second component is disappointment, which captures the discrepancy between actual and expected performance (much as the disconfirmation construct in traditional satisfaction research). The third component is regret, which captures the difference between the performance of the chosen product/service and the performance of a forgone product/service. This perspective is useful in that risk is captured by the disappointment and regret terms, providing an intuitively appealing decomposition of post-choice valuation and offering several advances over previous representations of disappointment and regret. We test our model via a choice experiment. Participants in the empirical study were asked to make choices between successive lottery pairs. They were then given outcome feedback on the forgone alternative as well as on the chosen alternative in each lottery pair. Immediately following outcome feedback for each choice, subjects were asked to evaluate their decision. Our results clearly suggest an effect of regret on post-choice valuation - information about the forgone alternative influenced subjects' valuation of the chosen alternative. We also find evidence that, as predicted, the effects of disappointment and regret on post-choice valuation are asymmetric. Specifically, the negative effect of disappointment on post-choice valuation was greater than the positive effect of elation. Similarly, the negative effect of regret was greater than the positive impact of rejoicing. Our research offers five contributions to the literature on post-choice valuation. First, our results illustrate the advantage of using generalized utility theory as the basis for conceptualizing and modeling post-choice valuation. We derive a model of post-choice valuation that formally captures the components of disappointment and regret and show that the outcome of both the chosen alternative (through disappointment) and a forgone alternative (through regret) can influence the chosen alternative's valuation. Second, we formally integrate the concepts of disappointment and regret, which have been examined separately for many years, into a single model based on a multiattribute preference structure. Third, we argue that the effects of disappointment and regret on post-choice valuation are asymmetric and present empirical evidence in this regard. Fourth, our results suggest that word-of-mouth regarding forgone alternatives may affect post-choice valuation, extending research that has not heretofore considered forgone outcomes' role in this process. Finally, our development provides a preconsumption measure of ""potential disappointment and regret"" in modeling choice. At the time of choice, consumers may visualize the feelings of disappointment and/or regret that will be derived at consumption, taking into account both the chosen brand and forgone brands. Our generalized utility theory-based approach to the post-choice valuation construct can be useful in examining the role of disappointment and regret as preconsumption constructs.","Buyer behavior; Disappointment; Post-choice valuation; Regret; Satisfaction; Utility theory","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0031286036"

The Internet of Things paradigm promises to increase the visibility and awareness of energy consumption, thanks to smart sensors and smart meters at the machine and production line level. Consequently, real-time energy consumption data from manufacturing processes can be collected easily, and then analyzed, to improve energy-aware decision-making. Relying on a comprehensive literature review and on experts' insight, this paper contributes to the understanding of energy-efficient production management practices that are enhanced and enabled by the Internet of Things technology. In addition, it discusses the benefits that can be obtained thanks to adopting such management practices. Eventually, a framework is presented to support the integration of gathered energy data into a company's information technology tools and platforms. This is done with the ultimate goal of highlighting how operational and tactical decision-making processes could leverage on such data in order to improve energy efficiency, and therefore competitiveness, of manufacturing companies. With the outcomes of this paper, energy managers can approach the Internet of Things adoption in a benefit-driven manner, addressing those energy management practices that are more aligned with company maturity, measurable data and available information systems and tools. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Cutting-edge technologies such as big data and internet of things (IoT) have the potential to leverage the adoption of CE concepts by organizations and society, becoming more present in our daily lives. Therefore, it is fundamentally important for researchers interested in this subject to understand the status quo of studies being undertaken worldwide and to have the overall picture of it. We conducted a bibliometric literature review from the Scopus Database over the period of 2006–2015 focusing on the application of big data/IoT on the context of CE. This produced the combination of 30,557 CE documents with 32,550 unique big data/IoT studies resulting in 70 matching publications that went through content and social network analysis with the use of ‘R’ statistical tool. We then compared it to some current industry initiatives. Bibliometrics findings indicate China and USA are the most interested countries in the area and reveal a context with significant opportunities for research. In addition, large producers of greenhouse gas emissions, such as Brazil and Russia, still lack studies in the area. Also, a disconnection between important industry initiatives and scientific research seems to exist. The results can be useful for institutions and researchers worldwide to understand potential research gaps and to focus future investments/studies in the field. © 2017, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.","Bibliometrics; Big data; Circular economy; Consumer behavior; Internet of things; Sustainability","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85011886767"

It also aims to determine the impact of travel antecedents such as the perceived characteristics of the wine region, information sources utilised, and previous knowledge of the region and its products on the destination decisionmaking process and ultimately the visitation motivations. Design/methodology/approach – Information is obtained from a random sample of 304 respondents from 12 wineries representing all size groups situated on the Paarl Wine Route (PWR) in South Africa. Data are collected through the use of a selfadministered, highly structured questionnaire, selfcompleted by respondents at each of the winery cellar door venues. Findings – The most important characteristic of the entire winescape is the region's scenic beauty. Other high impact characteristics are the friendly people and their hospitality, overall ambience and the diversity of wine estates. These factors point to hedonic behaviour in a highly social context and primarily a search for enjoyment/pleasure, mainly by firsttime visitors. The dynamic of firsttime and repeat visitation plays a key role in visitors' wine tourism behaviour. The decision to engage in wine tourism is generally impulsive, even spurious, the visit duration short and the motivations guiding the visitors' behaviour predominantly hedonic in nature. Research limitations/implications – The impact of the natural landscape underlines the premise that an experiential research approach can yield valuable insights and sheds new light on the fact that a memorable experience for a wine tourist does not only evolve inside the winery's cellar door. In the process it exposits what could be unique selling points for marketing differently positioned wine regions. Originality/value – This study is of value to academic researchers, travel and accommodation providers and wine industry practitioners alike as it highlights important aspects of wine tourism behaviour with regard to the actual (underlying) motivations that drive them to visit cellar doors in a wine region. © 2009, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Consumer behaviour; South Africa; Tourism development; Winemaking; Wines","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84986015035"

Findings - Findings of the study highlight that environmental patterns and self-fulfilment values are those that best characterise the ecological market segment. This group of consumers is characterised by their self-fulfilment feeling. They are people who always try to improve themselves and take actions which pose a new challenge for them. They are also characterised by having an ecological lifestyle, that is, environment consciousness, selecting and recycling products and taking part in events to protect the environment. This kind of consumer would be interested in firms that are committed to the environment and launch new products, showing them as a new and exciting experience.

The model is empirically tested using questionnaire survey data collected from 320 consumers in China. The results shown that consumer's knowledge about EVs is positively and significantly related to perceived usefulness, attitude and intention to adopt EVs, but negatively and significantly related to perceived risk. Perceived risk negatively affects perceived usefulness, attitude and intention to adopt EVs. Meanwhile, perceived usefulness has a positive effect on adoption intention and attitude, and attitude is also positively related to the intention to adopt EVs. However, the results also indicate that the financial incentive policy has no significant effect on intention to adopt EVs. In addition, the results also find that consumers lacking of knowledge about EVs and perceiving high risk of EVs could be the psychological barriers to their acceptance of EVs.

However, they do not usually consider consumers' travel attitudes, personality, lifestyle, and mobility as factors that may affect the vehicle type choice. The purpose of this study is to explore the relationship of such factors to individuals' vehicle type choices, and to develop a disaggregate choice model of vehicle type based on these factors as well as typical demographic variables. The data for this study comes from a 1998 mail-out/mail-back survey of 1904 residents in the San Francisco Bay Area. The dependent variable (the vehicle type the respondent drives most often) is classified into nine categories: small, compact, mid-sized, large, luxury, sports, minivan/van, pickup, and sport utility vehicle. Based on these categories, we first related vehicle type to travel attitude, personality, lifestyle, mobility, and demographic variables individually, using one-way analysis of variance and chi-squared tests. Then, a multinomial logit model for vehicle type choice was estimated. The final model (which possessed the IIA property) confirmed that the variables analyzed significantly affect an individual's vehicle type choice. These results provide useful background not only to vehicle manufacturers, but also to decision makers and planners of transportation policy related to vehicle ownership, traffic congestion, and energy consumption. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

One research stream shows that sometimes consumers perceive brands as having human-like forms, minds, and personality characteristics. A second stream identifies ways that a consumer perceives a brand as being congruent with or connected to the self. Finally, a third highlights that consumers can view brands in ways that are analogous to the types of relationships they have with people. We review research in these three areas and point out connections among these research streams. In part, we accomplish this by showing that factors associated with the SEEK model, which are designed to explain anthropomorphic tendencies, are also relevant to other ways of humanizing brands.

In five experiments, the authors demonstrate that social network use enhances self-esteem in users who are focused on close friends (i.e., strong ties) while browsing their social network. This momentary increase in self-esteem reduces self-control, leading those focused on strong ties to display less self-control after browsing a social network. Additionally, the authors present evidence suggesting that greater social network use is associated with a higher body mass index and higher levels of credit card debt for individuals with strong ties to their social network. This research extends previous findings by demonstrating that social networks primarily enhance self-esteem for those focused on strong ties during social network use.

Results show that income, housing type, members per household, the presence of outdoor uses (garden and swimming pool), the kind of species planted in the garden and consumer behaviour towards conservation practices play a significant role in explaining variations in water consumption. It is concluded that, along with prices and incomes, further research is needed on other demographic and housing variables in order to obtain a more comprehensive understanding of the determinants of domestic water consumption in areas periodically affected by water stress.","","Barcelona [Catalonia]; Catalonia; Eurasia; Europe; Southern Europe; Spain; conservation planning; consumption behavior; metropolitan area; urbanization; water demand","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-33746980180"

Design/methodology/approach - Data collection was divided into two phases. The first, (based on designers' opinions), to determine the key graphic variables in the design of packaging. The second, (based on consumers' opinions), to associate each packaging with a positioning strategy. The seven product-positioning strategies selected were represented from the consumers' standpoint using multidimensional scaling. Four maps were obtained related to: alternative packaging colours; alternative packaging typography; alternative packaging graphical forms; alternative packaging images Findings - Each positioning strategy appears associated with particular packaging dimensions. Research limitations/implications - Consumers have exhibited harmonious perceptions towards products-packaging strategies, so one can conclude that a general feeling as to what a particular packaging exactly means exists. So the general opinion should guide packaging designers to appropriately meet consumers' expectations. Originality/value - A range of simulated packaging was prepared for the 46 consumers that took part in the two-phase experiment: One of the seven positioning strategies was explained. For example: ""Product 'A' is positioned as reasonably priced. People say the price is OK""; Case to be solved: ""From this selection, choose the packaging that seems most suitable for product 'A', taking its characteristics into account"". The simulated packaging alternatives were shown and the subject chose the options that seemed most suitable (colour, typography, forms and images).

Thus, the present study aims to investigate the role of skepticism in green purchase behaviors. More specifically, based on the attitude-behavior-context theory, this study investigates the mediating role of environmental concern and environmental knowledge in the relationship between green skepticism and green purchase intentions in an emerging economy of Malaysia. The mall intercept method was used to collect responses from 303 actual retail customers. Structural equation modeling results show that environmental concern and environmental knowledge fully mediate the relationship between green skepticism and green purchase intentions. The findings reveal that green skepticism lowers customers' environmental knowledge and environmental concern, in turn adversely impacting their purchase intentions for green products.

Whilst in many industries companies have moved away from traditional features and benefits approaches, to putting experiential marketing centre-stage, marketing in the tourism and hospitality sectors does not appear to have explicitly engaged the theoretical issues involved. This raises the question what, if anything, does experiential marketing have to offer marketers in the disciplines of tourism and hospitality? In this paper, I will seek to introduce the experiential marketing debate and demonstrate how the questions raised by the concept are critical to an understanding of marketing theory and research within the tourism and hospitality sectors. Design/methodology/approach - Following the authors previous publications which sought to investigate alternative paradigms for studying hospitality consumers, this research attempts to consider the practical applications of one such model. Findings - The tourism and hospitality sectors cannot be seen to be immune to fundamental changes in the orientation of marketing. Innovative experience design will become an increasingly important component of tourism and hospitality firms core capabilities. Those who go beyond service excellence, and market experientially will lead the creation of value in the sector. Originality/value - Provides a framework as to how organisations might usefully implement an experiential marketing strategy. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Brands; Consumer behaviour; Hospitality management; Marketing; Postmodernism; Tourism","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-33747492383"

All of the key information on behavior, and attitudes, were collected from these consumers at both stages of the process. Market shares were gathered, on each of the 27 brands, at each stage. Loyalty was calculated for each respondent, across each brand, at each stage, so that movement across loyalty groups could be measured. Then, each respondent was classified by attitude toward the brand, and the conversion and retention of behavioral and attitudinal loyalty groups was tracked. This allowed for the calculation of whether attitude affects actual behavior. Finally, changes in market share were then compared to loyalty patterns to establish the predictive validity of a new loyalty-based model.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0012492406"

Examination of the effects of each type of knowledge on behaviors indicates that objective knowledge is only significantly related to committed recycling behaviors, whereas perceived knowledge is positively associated with committed recycling, source reduction, and political action behaviors.

Across one field study and three laboratory studies, the authors demonstrate that the effectiveness of the appeal type depends on whether the individual or collective level of the self is activated. When the collective level of self is activated, injunctive and descriptive normative appeals are most effective, whereas benefit appeals are less effective in encouraging sustainable behaviors. When the individual level of self is activated, self-benefit and descriptive appeals are particularly effective. The positive effects of descriptive appeals for the individual self are related to the informational benefits that such appeals can provide. The authors propose a goal-compatibility mechanism for these results and find that a match of congruent goals leads to the most positive consumer responses.

In this rich, fascinating - surprisingly accessible - introduction, leading expert Eric Siegel reveals how predictive analytics (aka machine learning) works, and how it affects everyone every day. Rather than a ""how to"" for hands-on techies, the book serves lay readers and experts alike by covering new case studies and the latest state-of-the-art techniques. Prediction is booming. It reinvents industries and runs the world. Companies, governments, law enforcement, hospitals, and universities are seizing upon the power. These institutions predict whether you're going to click, buy, lie, or die. Why? For good reason: predicting human behavior combats risk, boosts sales, fortifies healthcare, streamlines manufacturing, conquers spam, optimizes social networks, toughens crime fighting, and wins elections. How? Prediction is powered by the world's most potent, flourishing unnatural resource: data. Accumulated in large part as the by-product of routine tasks, data is the unsalted, flavorless residue deposited en masse as organizations churn away. Surprise! This heap of refuse is a gold mine. Big data embodies an extraordinary wealth of experience from which to learn. Predictive analytics(aka machine learning) unleashes the power of data. With this technology, the computer literally learns from data how to predict the future behavior of individuals. Perfect prediction is not possible, but putting odds on the future drives millions of decisions more effectively, determining whom to call, mail, investigate, incarcerate, set up on a date, or medicate. In this lucid, captivating introduction - now in its Revised and Updated edition - former Columbia University professor and Predictive Analytics World founder Eric Siegel reveals the power and perils of prediction: What type of mortgage risk Chase Bank predicted before the recession. Predicting which people will drop out of school, cancel a subscription, or get divorced before they even know it themselves. Why early retirement predicts a shorter life expectancy and vegetarians miss fewer flights. Five reasons why organizations predict death - including one health insurance company. How U.S. Bank and Obama for America calculated the way to most strongly persuade each individual. Why the NSA wants all your data: machine learning supercomputers to fight terrorism. How IBM's Watson computer used predictive modeling to answer questions and beat the human champs on TV's Jeopardy! How companies ascertain untold, private truths - how Target figures out you're pregnant and Hewlett-Packard deduces you're about to quit your job. How judges and parole boards rely on crime-predicting computers to decide how long convicts remain in prison. 182 examples from Airbnb, the BBC, Citibank, ConEd, Facebook, Ford, Google, the IRS, LinkedIn, Match.com, MTV, Netflix, PayPal, Pfizer, Spotify, Uber, UPS, Wikipedia, and more. How does predictive analytics work? This jam-packed book satisfies by demystifying the intriguing science under the hood. For future hands-on practitioners pursuing a career in the field, it sets a strong foundation, delivers the prerequisite knowledge, and whets your appetite for more. A truly omnipresent science, predictive analytics constantly affects our daily lives. Whether you are a consumer of it - or consumed by it - get a handle on the power of Predictive Analytics. © 2016 by Eric Siegel.

This article adopts resource exchange theory to examine how two routes of interactivity (structural vs. experiential) influence reciprocity and affect commitment and co-shopping. Using a netnography study and an online survey, the authors confirm the significant effects of structural and experiential routes of interactivity on reciprocity. Reciprocity has critical effects on social system maintenance by enhancing commitment to the community and intention to co-shop.

The phenomenon by which consumers hold firms responsible for the unsustainable behavior of their upstream partners suggests the notion of ""chain liability."" This study aims to generate insights into the antecedents and consequences of such consumer responsibility attributions. Using data from four vignette-based survey experiments, the authors find that the chain liability effect increases if an environmental degradation incident (1) results from supplier behavior rather than force majeure, (2) results from a company decision rather than the decision of an individual employee, and (3) is more severe. Responsibility attributions do not differ with varying organizational distance from the supplier, firm size, strategic importance of the supplied product, or the existence of environmental management systems. The chain liability effect also creates strong risks for the focal firm; higher responsibility attributions increase consumers' anger and propensity to boycott. Therefore, firms should work to ensure sustainable behavior throughout the supply chain, to protect them from chain liability. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Attribution theory; Environmental issues; Structural equation modeling; Supply chain management; Vignette-based experiments","Environmental management systems; Supply chain management; Attribution theory; Environmental issues; Firm size; Force majeure; Kimberly-Clark; Multi-tier; Structural equation modeling; Consumer behavior","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84902368560"

The paper theoretically and empirically explores three interrelated aspects of these playscapes: production and the increasing role of a small number of large-scale corporate leisure and entertainment operators providing sanitised, 'branded' experiences; regulation in which the development of urban playscapes can be understood through a night-time entertainment regime based around a modified relationship between state, developers and consumers, including enhanced forms of surveillance and control; and consumption which is characterised by segmentation and differentiation and based around more 'exclusive' and 'up-market' identities. We argue that these three aspects combine to create a dominant mode of 'mainstream' urban nightlife, with 'alternative' and 'residual' nightlife increasingly under threat or squeezed out. In conclusion, we discuss some of the interrelationships between production, regulation and consumption and suggest a number of potential future scenarios for nightlife development.","","United Kingdom; consumption behavior; leisure industry; urban area; urban economy; urban population; young population","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0036137429"

That the Great Crash generated uncertainty is evidenced by the decline in surety expressed by contemporary forecasters. That this uncertainty affected consumer behavior is shown by the fact that spending on consumer durables declined drastically in late 1929, while spending on perishable goods rose slightly. This effect is confirmed by the fact that there is a significant negative relationship between stock market variability and the production of consumer durables in the prewar era. © 1990, by the President and Fellows of Harvard College and The Massachusetts Institute of Technology.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-43549121881"

However, these benefits will not be realized if consumers do not adopt this new technology. Several agent-based models have been developed to model potential market penetration of PHEVs, but gaps in the available data limit the usefulness of these models. To address this, we administered a survey to 1000 stated US residents, using Amazon Mechanical Turk, to better understand factors influencing the potential for PHEV market penetration. Our analysis of the survey results reveals quantitative patterns and correlations that extend the existing literature. For example, respondents who felt most strongly about reducing US transportation energy consumption and cutting greenhouse gas emissions had, respectively, 71 and 44 times greater odds of saying they would consider purchasing a compact PHEV than those who felt least strongly about these issues. However, even the most inclined to consider a compact PHEV were not generally willing to pay more than a few thousand US dollars extra for the sticker price. Consistent with prior research, we found that financial and battery-related concerns remain major obstacles to widespread PHEV market penetration. We discuss how our results help to inform agent-based models of PHEV market penetration, governmental policies, and manufacturer pricing and marketing strategies to promote consumer adoption of PHEVs. © 2014 The Authors.","Crowd-sourced opinion survey; Electric vehicle technology adoption; Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs)","United States; Automobile manufacture; Autonomous agents; Commerce; Computational methods; Consumer behavior; Energy utilization; Felt; Felts; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Secondary batteries; Simulation platform; Surveys; Amazon mechanical turks; Consumer adoptions; Governmental policies; Market penetration; Opinion surveys; Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles; Transportation energy consumption; Vehicle technology; electric vehicle; marketing; survey method; technology adoption; willingness to pay; Plug-in hybrid vehicles","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84898651821"

Much research across numerous ethical contexts has drawn on these theories to offer a better understanding of how consumers form intentions to act in an ethical way. Persistently, researchers have suggested and discussed the existence of an intention–behaviour gap in ethical consumption. Yet, the factors that influence the extent of this gap and its magnitude have not been systematically examined. We, therefore, contribute to the debate on the intention–behaviour gap by reviewing the empirical TRA/TPB studies that have assessed both intention and behaviour in ethical contexts. The findings from our review show that few studies assessed the intention–behaviour relationship and as a result, there is limited empirical evidence to date to quantify more accurately the intention–behaviour gap in ethical consumption. Our second contribution aims to provide an empirical case study which assesses the magnitude of the intention–behaviour gap in the context of avoidance of sweatshop clothing and to assess the roles of planning and actual behavioural control in potentially reducing the intention–behaviour gap. The findings of our case study suggest that there is indeed a large gap between intention and behaviour, and we conclude by calling for more empirical longitudinal studies to assess the complex nature of the relationship between intention and behaviour. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Actual behavioural control; Ethical clothing; Intention–behaviour gap; Planning; Review; Theory of planned behaviour; Theory of reasoned action","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84911390772"

Three models of different conceptualization specifications were estimated and compared with eTail service value survey data. Findings – Based on theory, perceived value should be conceived as a formative construct. The empirical results demonstrated different parameter estimates and thus conclusions are drawn from different conceptualization methods. Research limitations/implications – Future research is suggested to apply the proposed formative value model in other marketing settings, and to explore the role of consumer satisfaction in post-purchase behavior. Practical implications – Marketing resources allocation and communication programs may be influenced due to different conceptualization methods of value construct applied by practitioners.

The study identifies two factors that account for individual differences, i.e. perceived enjoyment (PE) and perceived mobility value (PMV), to enhance the explanatory power of the model. Design/methodology/approach - An online survey was conducted to collect data. A total of 313 undergraduate and graduate students in two Taiwan universities answered the questionnaire. Most of the constructs in the model were measured using existing scales, while some measurement items were created specifically for this research. Structural equation modeling was employed to examine the fit of the data with the model by using the LISREL software. Findings - The results of the data analysis shows that the data fit the extended TAM model well. Consumers hold positive attitudes for M-learning, viewing M-learning as an efficient tool. Specifically, the results show that individual differences have a great impact on user acceptance and that the perceived enjoyment and perceived mobility can predict user intentions of using M-learning. Originality/value - There is scant research available in the literature on user acceptance of M-learning from a customer's perspective. The present research shows that TAM can predict user acceptance of this new technology. Perceived enjoyment and perceived mobility value are antecedents of user acceptance. The model enhances our understanding of consumer motivation of using M-learning. This understanding can aid our efforts when promoting M-learning.","Learning; Mobile communication systems; Taiwan","Computer simulation; Data reduction; Information services; Information technology; Mobile devices; Mobile telecommunication systems; Mobile learning; Technology acceptance model; E-learning","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-35648948383"

In three empirical studies, we examined whether market data are consistent with some of the implications of our model. In the first study, using observational data from two US supermarket chains, we found that store brands are more likely to target stronger national brands. Our second study estimated cross-price effects in 19 product categories, and found that only in categories with high-quality store brands, store brand and the leading national brand compete more intensely with each other than with the secondary national brand. In a third product perception study, we found that although explicit targeting by store brands influenced consumer perceptions of physical similarity, it had no influence on consumers' perceptions of overall or product quality similarity.

First, we examine and discuss emerging global food chains that are embedded in strategic alliances, joint ventures and relationships - in short in networks of power. Decisions are being displaced away from multiple actors situated in different localities to globalized decision-making located within a few firms that make up each cluster. While the roots of these phenomena are firmly grounded in long-term historical processes, it is important to document and understand what is emerging at the global level in order to create alternatives. Second, we discuss our outreach work with farmers, consumers and communities in helping them to frame and understand the changes that are taking place in the food and agriculture system. This is exemplified through a case study of the Kansas City Food Circle and its role in generating alternative visions from the consumption side of the food equation. This work is extremely important for challenging the global food system, and also for helping to empower farmers, eaters and communities to create alternatives. We lay out an analytical understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the global system, and the opportunities found in the social, environmental and economic failures of the global system. In conclusion, the work described above rests on the recognition of different forms of agency that are appearing in the food system, agency that is located within the spaces provided by the unsustainable, unjust nature of the global system. We remain cognizant of the incredible networks of power that shape the production and consumption relationships in the food system. However, we remain hopeful that models of emerging alternatives can help relocalize production/consumption relationships in the food system in equitable ways. In other words, in relationships that are personalized and sustainable, and that are embedded in place and community.","","consumption behavior; food production; global perspective; power relations","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0036820169"

While grocery shopping is an essential activity, not much is known about the dynamic relationship of the COVID-19 pandemic to the behavior of grocery shoppers. With an objective to inform variability in the behavior of grocery shoppers under various scenarios of the COVID-19 pandemic, we conducted an online framed choice experiment to elicit preferences for purchasing methods, time windows, minimum order requirements, and fees. The manipulating factor relates to the trend in the COVID-19 pandemic, where we consider three scenarios: an increasing, decreasing, or constant number of new cases in the past two-week period. Using 32,400 choice decisions from a representative sample of 900 grocery shoppers in the United States, we conclude that the trend in the COVID-19 pandemic causes significant differences in grocery shopping preferences. In situations where COVID-19 is spreading at an increasing rate, consumers are generally less willing to shop inside the grocery store. When COVID-19 is spreading at a decreasing rate, the relative importance of the purchasing method attribute is lower in its entirety.

Although residential solar has recently become more affordable, market penetration in the U.S. remains relatively low. This study proposes a theoretical framework for investigating the psychological and social determinants of interest in residential solar drawn from three theories that may explain the decision to pursue it: diffusion of innovations theory, theory of planned behavior, and value-belief-norm theory. We test this framework using survey data from 904 non- adopter homeowners, with the aim of identifying potential levers for intervention. Overall, we find that consumers see solar electricity in multiple ways: as an environmental benefit, a consumer good, and an innovative technology. Notably, individuals who trust installers and believe solar will be personally beneficial are more likely to consider contacting an installer, as are individuals drawn to novel products. Proenvironmental personal norms indirectly increase interest through perceived personal benefits, suggesting that marketing efforts aimed at environmentally-concerned individuals may need to emphasize non-environmental benefits. The results also support leveraging trusted social networks to convey the benefits of solar. We conclude by discussing the value of the integrated framework along with implications for policymakers and marketers. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Diffusion of innovations; Environmental decision making; Renewable energy; Residential solar photovoltaics; Theory of planned behavior; Value-belief- norm theory","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85010280695"

This study used an empirical model to measure merchant's intention to use a mobile wallet technology. The study includes the variables, perceived compatibility, perceived usefulness, awareness, perceived cost, perceived customer value addition and perceived trust, and aims to determine their influence on intention to use. Our study also tested the mediating effect of perceived trust on the influence of perceived usefulness to predict merchant's intention. The study includes results of the survey of 315 Indian merchants by an online survey method. We find the highest effect of perceived customer value addition on merchant's intention, followed by perceived usefulness of technology. The proposed mediation effect of perceived trust was small but significant on perceived usefulness. The results of the study can help mobile payment companies to understand factors that are relevant to increase adoption of technology in the context of merchants. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Customer value addition; Intention to use; Merchants; Mobile wallets; Perceived trust","consumption behavior; empirical analysis; mobile phone; perception; retailing; stakeholder; technology adoption","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85069673411"

There is little known information about recycling lithium-ion batteries from consumer electronics in China, despite China is the largest lithium-ion battery manufacturer and consumer. To address this gap, this paper aims at investigating the current status of recycling spent lithium-ion batteries from consumer electronics in China, and to provide recommendations for improving spent lithium-ion battery recycling rate. Generation, collection and recycling of spent lithium-ion batteries were investigated using a combined methodology consists of online surveys, field investigations and estimations. The survey shows that although respondents have expressed their willingness towards recycling, most of them did not know where to send their spent lithium-ion batteries. Field investigations were carried out to trace the material flow of spent lithium-ion batteries in current waste electric and electronic equipment collection systems. It was found that the spent lithium-ion batteries are not included in current collection systems, as only few recycling practitioners are collecting spent lithium-ion batteries. Inadequate supply was found to have a significant impact on current recycling industry. Combining official statistics, survey results and actual throughput of the recycling plants, it was roughly estimated that less than 10% of lithium-ion batteries used in consumer electronics are currently recycled, while others always end up in idle or landfill. This study provides essential information on status quo of recycling lithium-ion batteries from consumer electronics in China including consumers' behaviours, recycling practices and estimated recycling rate. Further, policy implications were proposed with the purpose of promoting recycling rates of spent LIBs from CEs. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Consumer electronic; Field investigation; Online survey; Recycling rate; Spent lithium-ion battery; Waste electric and electronic equipment","Consumer electronics; Electronic equipment; Electronic Waste; Ions; Public policy; Recycling; Surveys; Field investigation; Online surveys; Recycling rate; Spent lithium-ion batteries; Waste electric and electronic equipments; Lithium-ion batteries","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85025438020"

This has resulted in an urgent need to study the motivations which enhance consumers’ proclivity to purchase food items produced organically. The current research attempts to understand potential associations between motivations (intrinsic and extrinsic), attitude, and buying behaviour towards organic food. Self-determination theory (SDT) was applied to develop a theoretically grounded framework which was evaluated with 378 organic food consumers. The hypotheses were tested by analyzing the data through structural equation modelling (SEM), wherein environmental concerns and trust were the moderating variables. The study results demonstrate the significant influence of intrinsic motivation, integrated and external regulation on consumer attitude, and buying behaviour. But, attitude had no significant association with buying behaviour. The findings indicate consumers’ motivation may be stimulated to encourage higher frequencies of purchasing organic food by emphasizing values that reflect motivations arising from ethical or green consumerism, health, and social benefits. Furthermore, policymakers should focus on avenues to integrate organic food as permanent parts of individual lives and a socially exalting behavioral action. © 2020 The Authors","Buying behaviour; Environmental concerns; OOrganic food; Self-determination theory; Trust","agricultural market; consumption behavior; food consumption; food market; food product; food quality; organic farming","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089841275"

For example, 1) it is not necessary to exceed customer expectations to increase preference, 2) receiving an expected level of bad service does not reduce preference, 3) rational customers may rationally choose an option with lower expected quality, even if all non-quality attributes are equal, and 4) paying more attention to loyal, experienced customers can sometimes be counter-productive. These surprising findings make sense in retrospect, once customer expectations are viewed as distributions, rather than simple point expectations. That is, each customer has a probability density function that describes the relative likelihood that a particular quality outcome will be experienced. Customers form these expectation distributions based on their cumulative experience with the good or service. A customer's cumulative expectation distribution may be conceptualized as being a predictive density for the next transaction. When combined with a diminishing returns (i.e., concave) utility function, this Bayesian theoretical framework results in predictions of: (a) how consumers will behave over time, and (b) how their perceptions and evaluations will change. In managerial terms, we conclude that customers consider not only expected quality, but also risk. This may help explain why current measures of customer satisfaction (which is highly related to expected quality) only partially predict future behavior. We find that most of the predictions of our theoretical model are borne out by empirical evidence from two experiments. Thus, we conclude that our approach provides a useful simplification of reality that successfully predicts many aspects of the dynamics of consumer response to quality. These findings are relevant to both academics and managers. Academics in the area of customer satisfaction and service quality need to be aware that it may be insufficient to measure only the point expectation, as has always been the standard practice. Instead it may be necessary to measure the uncertainty that the customer has with respect to the level of service that will be received. Due to questionnaire length constraints, it may not be practical for managers to include uncertainty questions on customer satisfaction surveys. Nevertheless it is possible to build a proxy for uncertainty by measuring the extent of experience with the service/good, and this proxy can be used to partially control for uncertainty effects. The findings of the study were obtained using 1) an analytical model of customer expectation updating, based on a set of assumptions that are well-supported in the academic literature, and 2) two behavioral experiments using human subjects: a cross-sectional experiment, and a longitudinal experiment. Both the analytical model and the behavioral experiments were designed to investigate the effects that distributions of expectations might have, and especially the effects that might deviate from the predictions that would arise from a traditional point expectation model. The behavioral experiments largely confirmed the predictions of the analytical model. As it turned out, the analytical model correctly (in most cases) predicted behavioral effects that contradict some of the best-accepted ""truisms"" of customer satisfaction. It is now clear that a more sophisticated view of customer expectations is required - one that considers not only the point expectation but also the likelihood across the entire distribution of possible outcomes. This distinction is not ""just academic,"" because it results in predictable behavior that deviates significantly from that which was traditionally expected based on simpler models.

A sample of 1089 university students is analyzed to estimate the effect of psychological factors (motivations, attitudes, perceived consumer effectiveness (PCE) and environmental knowledge) on behavior towards the environment from a gender perspective. To model such behavior and direct better environmental policies and strategies an ordered logit model is developed for each gender. Significant differences are found, with specific factors affecting each gender's pro-environmental behavior.

An e-mail survey of online users examined perceived privacy concerns of 15 different situations involving collection and usage of personally identifiable information. Results indicate that the vast majority of online users are pragmatic when it comes to privacy. Further analysis of the data suggested that online users can be segmented into four distinct groups, representing differing levels of privacy concern. Distinct demographic differences were seen. Persons with higher levels of education are more concerned about their privacy online than persons with less education. Additionally, persons over the age of 45 years tended to be either not at all concerned about privacy or highly concerned about privacy. Younger persons tended to be more pragmatic.

To promote the adoption of EVs, great efforts have been made and a series of policy measures have been introduced. However, the widespread adoption of EVs is likely to be insufficient. This study divides policy measures into three catalogs (i.e., financial incentive policy measures, information provision policy measures and convenience policy measures) and investigates how these policy measures motivate consumers to adopt EVs and how such effects are moderated by consumers’ environmental concern. The results of a survey of 324 respondents suggest that three catalogs of policy measures are positively and significantly related to EVs adoption intention, and convenience policy measures are the most important policy measures to promote EVs. In addition, the results indicate that consumers’ environmental concern plays a moderating role in the relationships between two catalogs of policy measures (financial incentive policy measures and convenience policy measures) and EVs adoption intention.

In this paper, I look at these phenomena as processes of a ‘neoliberalisation of feminism'. I illustrate such neoliberalisation by introducing women's empowerment projects run by transnational consumer products companies, typically in partnership with public development actors. Under the label of ‘corporate social responsibility', these companies invest in women in their supply and marketing chains, seeking to empower them within a neoliberal rationality of government. The paper is an effort to go beyond the critiques of feminism as co-opted. Rather than inventing new feminisms or taking a break from feminism – as some have suggested, I propose that it is more fruitful and necessary to examine, in concrete contexts, the way in which select feminist movement ideas are being integrated into neoliberal rationales and logics, what is lost in the process and what is perhaps gained. © 2014, © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","corporate social responsibility; feminism; neoliberalism; public-private partnerships","corporate strategy; feminism; neoliberalism; political economy; public-private partnership; social behavior","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84930042210"

In an attempt to meet these social needs, producers of conspicuous goods like cars, perfumes, and watches, highlight the exclusivity of their products. In this paper, we propose a monopoly model of conspicuous consumption using the rational expectations framework, and then examine how purchase decisions are affected by the desire for exclusivity and conformity. We show that snobs can have an upward-sloping demand curve but only in the presence of consumers who are (weakly) followers. Laboratory tests lend support for this model prediction and for the rational expectations framework. The experimental results suggest that subjects used some degree of sophisticated thinking to arrive at their first-period decisions. Their behavior in the subsequent trials, however, can be adequately captured by a purely adaptive learning mechanism.

The key question at this point is how to turn the available plentitude of individual consumer opinions into aggregate consumer preferences, which can be used, for example, in product development or improvement processes. To solve this problem, an econometric framework is presented that can be applied to the mentioned type of data after having prepared it using natural language processing techniques. The suggested methodology enables the estimation of parameters, which allow inferences on the relative effect of product attributes and brand names on the overall evaluation of the products. Specifically, we discuss options for taking opinion heterogeneity into account.

This has resulted in a number of initiatives and labels indicating 'pesticide safe' vegetables. However, the pesticide-residue problem has proved enduring. This opens a market opportunity for organic foods, which are produced entirely without using synthetic chemicals. As little is known on consumer perception of organic foods in Thailand, a survey was conducted in Bangkok. More than a third of the 848 respondents reported having purchased organic vegetables or fruits in the past. The main reasons for purchasing organic products are that consumers expect them to be healthier, that organic products are environmentally friendly. The respondents who have bought organic vegetables tend to be older, have a higher education level and a higher family income than those who have not bought them. The main barrier to increasing the market share of organic vegetables is that consumers do not clearly differentiate between the various 'pesticide safe' labels and the organic labels. Informing consumers about unique characteristics of organic production methods, the strict inspection and required third party certification might be a promising strategy to develop the market for organic vegetables in Thailand's urban centers. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The authors argue that this conclusion may be incorrect in that what consumers can explicitly remember is not always a good indicator of what they implicitly know.

We also examine why teens shop with friends. Specifically, we relate friends' knowledge and teens' age to teenagers' susceptibility to informational and normative influence from friends. Susceptibility to peer influence is then related to various aspects of teen shopping, such as frequency and enjoyment of shopping with pals, which, in turn, are related to sentiment toward retailing and spending tendencies.

The food retailing scenario is becoming more complex and flexible putting pressure on the retailing firms to re-design their marketing strategies incorporating the changing consumer behavior.

Made possible through community interaction and, increasingly, use of network technologies, these alternative and more sustainable ways of consuming have attracted growing attention for their potential to prevent new purchases, intensify the use of idle assets and promote reuse of possessions that are no longer wanted. Nonetheless, the uptake of Product-Service Systems (PSSs) that enable collaborative consumption is still very limited. This paper investigates how consumers' values can influence the acceptance, adoption and diffusion of collaborative consumption. It reviews two theoretical frameworks used to understand pro-environmental behaviour, social psychological models of behaviour and social practice theory. Coming from contrasting disciplinary perspectives, these approaches conceptualise values differently. The paper evaluates the possibility of resolving these differences through a mixed methods study. It examines values empirically through a case study of Ecomodo, a UK-based online marketplace where people can lend and borrow each other's objects, spaces and skills, and present the results of a quantitative study which identified and measured value priorities among Ecomodo users through Schwartz's Portrait Value Questionnaire. It concludes with a discussion of the role of values in relation to the introduction and scaling up of PSSs that enable collaborative consumption. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Collaborative consumption; Pro-environmental behaviour change; Product-service systems; Social practice theory; Social psychology; Values","Electronic commerce; Sustainable development; Behaviour changes; Collaborative consumption; Product-service systems; Social practice theories; Social psychology; Values; Behavioral research","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84928760780"

Design/methodology/approach: This study proposes and tests an integrative model that synthesizes the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), Prospect Theory (PT) and other Airbnb-relevant constructs (unique experience expectation, familiarity and electronic word of mouth) as the primary determinants of the Airbnb repurchase intention using an structural equation model (SEM) approach. Findings: Both attitude and subject norms are significant determinants of repurchase intention, whereas perceived behavioral control is not. In addition, perceived value and risk have only direct significant impacts on attitude and, in turn, indirectly affect repurchase intention. Unique experience expectation, familiarity and electronic word of mouth exert direct and indirect influences on repurchase intention. Research limitations/implications: This study extends the body of knowledge by integrating TPB and PT to investigate consumer repurchase intention in Airbnb, which provides a theoretical baseline and serves as a starting point for exploring the structural relationships of Airbnb and the sharing economy. Practical implications: Airbnb should place more emphasis on value packages and authentic/unique travel experience to retain and attract more travelers. More safety/security programs should be put in place and clearly communicated to reduce the perceived risks. In addition, Airbnb may publicize positive word of mouth and introduce and expand familiarity programs to incentivize Airbnb travelers. Originality/value: This study explores the psychological reasons why travelers will re-patronize Airbnb, providing insights into the motives of Airbnb travelers.

The whole world has come together to work in the direction to protect the environment. Consumers are increasingly becoming cautious towards the impact of their consumption pattern on environment and organisations can attain a competitive edge by leveraging this cautiousness by offering them green products/brands. However, it is importance for the marketers to understand that how increasing levels of sustainability awareness impacts other factors which explain pro-environmental behaviour of customers. To fill the existing gap in the current literature in this regard, the current study aims to build a structural model which includes social and environmental sustainability awareness in measuring customer altruism, buying intention, loyalty and customer evangelism. The theoretical model extends the existing framework of the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) and explores the decision-making framework regarding ethical behaviour. Through existing literature review and expert input, the indicators (variables) for each construct were recognised. After that, data was collected from 331 respondents through a structurally designed questionnaire; the hypothetical model was test using the Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) technique. The findings of the study indicate that sustainability awareness positively influence the consumer altruism which in turn enhances the consumer purchase intention, green brand loyalty and green brand evangelism and altruism can and can bridge value-action gap for green brands.

In particular, a 3 × 3 × 2 experiment was conducted to examine the impact of incentives, tie-strength, and satisfaction on WOM behavior. Consumer deal proneness was investigated using a quasi-experimental design. Suggests from the findings that satisfaction does not necessarily increase the likelihood of WOM being generated. Shows incentives to be an effective catalyst to increase the likelihood of WOM being generated by satisfied consumers and tie strength to be an important variable in explaining WOM behavior. Suggests from the findings that deal prone consumers generate more WOM, independent of incentives. The findings have important implications, and suggest that satisfied customers are a necessary but not sufficient condition for getting positive WOM, and that incentives may be an effective way to get satisfied customers to recommend a firm. Furthermore, incentive programs targeted at strong ties are likely to be more effective than those targeted at weak ties, provided customers are genuinely happy with the service provided.","Customer satisfaction; Effectiveness; Incentives; Purchasing; Recommendations","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0035998689"

IB studies have showed encouraging results from academics in developed countries. Yet little is known about the user adoption of IB in Lebanon. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the factors that may hinder or facilitate the acceptance and usage of IB in Lebanon. Design/methodology/approach – A conceptual framework was developed through extending the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) by incorporating two additional factors namely; perceived credibility (PC) and task-technology fit (TTF). A quantitative approach based on cross-sectional survey was used to collect data from 408 IB consumers. Data were analysed using structural equation modelling based on AMOS 20.0. Findings – The results of the structural path revealed that performance expectancy (PE), social influence, PC and TTF to be significant predictors in influencing customers’ behavioural intention (BI) to use IB and explained 61 per cent of its variance, with PE was found the strongest antecedent of BI. Contrary to the UTAUT, the effect of effort expectancy on BI was insignificant. In addition, both BI and facilitating conditions were found to affect the actual usage behaviour and explained 64 per cent of its variance Practical implications – This study would be helpful for bank managers and policy makers to explain the currently relatively low penetration rate of IB in formulating strategies to encourage the adoption and acceptance of IB by Lebanese customers, where IB is still considered an innovation. Originality/value – This study is the first research that extend the UTAUT by incorporating two additional factors namely; PC and TTF to study the IB in the Lebanese context.

This paper seeks to fill this gap in the literature. Design/methodology/approach - This paper builds propositions about the role of price and customer satisfaction at different stages on customers' intention to return. Research hypotheses are developed based on theory from the combined literatures of services, product pricing, and behavioral decision theory. Data from the e-retailing industry related to two specific periods of shopping experience (at checkout and after delivery) are used in the empirical tests. Structural equation modeling is employed to test the hypothesized relationships. Findings - The findings of this study indicate that after-delivery satisfaction has a much stronger influence on both overall customer satisfaction and intention to return than at-checkout satisfaction, and that price perception, when measured on a comparative basis, has a direct and positive effect on customer overall satisfaction and intention to return. Research limitations/implications - The data are only available from surveying customers who have made purchases. Future study can investigate how satisfaction with shopping convenience has impacted customer acquisition. Measures of actual return behavior, as opposed to behavioral intentions, will also enhance the validity of the study. Practical implications - This paper concludes that excellence pre-sales service is not necessarily an advantage that allows e-tailers to develop customer retention. In fact, e-tailers might command higher customer retention through providing good performance in after-delivery service and continuously generating favorable price perceptions among customers because both have a strong and positive influence on return intention. Originality/value - This research conceptualizes and explores different aspects of satisfaction that unfold over time, regarding customers' whole shopping experience with a particular e-retailer. It is a pioneer work that empirically investigates the relative contribution of at-checkout and after-delivery satisfaction in generating intention to return to an e-tailer. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Consumer behaviour; Customer retention; Customer satisfaction; Internet; Perception; Prices","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-18844448693"

Cultural and personal associations with animal product consumption create barriers to moderating consumption, and hence reduced environmental impacts. Here we review alternatives to conventional animal products, including cultured meat, imitation meat and insects (i.e. entomophagy), and explore the potential change in global agricultural land requirements associated with each alternative. Stylised transformative consumption scenarios where half of current conventional animal products are substituted to provide at least equal protein and calories are considered. The analysis also considers and compares the agricultural land area given shifts between conventional animal product consumption. The results suggest that imitation meat and insects have the highest land use efficiency, but the land use requirements are only slightly greater for eggs and poultry meat. The efficiency of insects and their ability to convert agricultural by-products and food waste into food, suggests further research into insect production is warranted. Cultured meat does not appear to offer substantial benefits over poultry meat or eggs, with similar conversion efficiency, but higher direct energy requirements. Comparison with the land use savings from reduced consumer waste, including over-consumption, suggests greater benefits could be achieved from alternative dietary transformations considered. We conclude that although a diet with lower rates of animal product consumption is likely to create the greatest reduction in agricultural land, a mix of smaller changes in consumer behaviour, such as replacing beef with chicken, reducing food waste and potentially introducing insects more commonly into diets, would also achieve land savings and a more sustainable food system. © 2017 The Authors","Animal products; Cultured meat; Dietary change; Entomophagy; Land use; Livestock","","Review","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85018649812"

However, CSR is poorly defined and little is known about the mechanisms by which this response occurs. This paper seeks to understand how consumers define CSR and how it can enhance the overall value proposition for consumers. Design/methodology/approach: The value typology developed by Sheth et al. is integrated with qualitative data to enhance understanding of these value paths. Interviews were conducted with consumers through the heart of the current recession, when consumers were particularly aware of value when making purchase decisions. Findings: The way in which CSR manifests itself determines consumer support. CSR can provide three forms of value to consumers: emotional, social, and functional. Each of these enhances or diminishes the overall value proposition for consumers. Further, value created by one form of CSR can either enhance or diminish other product attributes. Practical implications: The current research helps managers understand how CSR can create value for consumers. As a result, managers can better position products in order to enhance overall value. Further, practitioners can match the value with which consumers identify from CSR to the dominant value driver in their product category.

The choice of one category may affect the selection of another category due to the complementary nature (e.g., cake mix and cake frosting) of the two categories. Alternatively, two categories may co-occur in a shopping basket not because they are complementary but because of similar purchase cycles (e.g., beer and diapers) or because of a host of other unobserved factors. While complementarity gives managers some control over consumers' buying behavior (e.g., a change in the price of cake mix could change the purchase probability of cake frosting), co-occurrence or co-incidence is less controllable. Other factors that may affect multi-category choice may be (unobserved) household preferences or (observed) household demographics. We also argue that not accounting for these three factors simultaneously could lead to erroneous inferences. We then develop a conceptual framework that incorporates complementarity, co-incidence and heterogeneity (both observed and unobserved) as the factors that could lead to multicategory choice. We then translate this framework into a model of multi-category choice. Our model is based on random utility theory and allows for simultaneous, interdependent choice of many items. This model, the multivariate probit model, is implemented in a Hierarchical Bayes framework. The hierarchy consists of three levels. The first level captures the choice of items for the shopping basket during a shopping trip. The second level captures differences across households and the third level specifies the priors for the unknown parameters. We generalize some recent advances in Markov chain Monte Carlo methods in order to estimate the model. Specifically, we use a substitution sampler which incorporates techniques such as the Metropolis Hit-and-Run algorithm and the Gibbs Sampler. The model is estimated on four categories (cake mix, cake frosting, fabric detergent and fabric softener) using multicategory panel data. The results disentangle the complementarity and co-incidence effects. The complementarity results show that pricing and promotional changes in one category affect purchase incidence in related product categories. In general, the cross-price and cross-promotion effects are smaller than the own-price and own-promotions effects. The cross-effects are also asymmetric across pairs of categories, i.e., related category pairs may be characterized as having a ""primary"" and a ""secondary"" category. Thus these results provide a more complete description of the effects of promotional changes by examining them both within and across categories. The co-incidence results show the extent of the relationship between categories that arises from uncontrollable and unobserved factors. These results are useful since they provide insights into a general structure of dependence relationships across categories. The heterogeneity results show that observed demographic factors such as family size influence the intrinsic category preference of households. Larger family sizes also tend to make households more price sensitive for both the primary and secondary categories. We find that price sensitivities across categories are not highly correlated at the household level. We also find some evidence that intrinsic preferences for cake mix and cake frosting are more closely related than preferences for fabric detergent and fabric softener. We compare our model with a series of null models using both estimation and holdout samples. We show that both complementarity and co-incidence play a significant role in predicting multicategory choice. We also show how many single-category models used in conjunction may not be good predictors of joint choice. Our results are likely to be of interest to retailers and manufacturers trying to optimize pricing and promotion strategies across many categories as well as in designing micromarketing strategies. We illustrate some of these benefits by carrying out an analysis which shows that the ""true"" impact of complementarity and co-incidence on profitability is significant in a retail setting. Our model can also be applied to other domains. The combination of item interdependence and individual household level estimates may be of particular interest to database marketers in building customized ""cross-selling"" strategies in the direct mail and financial service industries.","Hierarchical Bayes Models; Micromarketing; Multicategory Models; Multivariate Probit Model; Retailing; Shopping Baskets","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0033474408"

The sales increase for a brand on promotion could be due to consumers accelerating their purchases (i.e., buying earlier than usual and/or buying more than usual) and/or consumers switching their choice from other brands. Purchase acceleration and brand switching relate to the primary demand and secondary demand effects of a promotion. Gupta (1988) captures these effects in a single model and decomposes a brand's total price elasticity into these components. He reports, for the coffee product category, that the main impact of a price promotion is on brand choice (84%), and that there is a smaller impact on purchase incidence (14%) and stockpiling (2%). In other words, the majority of the effect of a promotion is at the secondary level (84%) and there is a relatively small primary demand effect (16%). This paper reports the decomposition of total price elasticity for 173 brands across 13 different product categories. On average, we find that 25% of the elasticity is due to primary demand expansion (i.e., purchase acceleration) and 75% to secondary demand effects or brand switching. Thus, while Gupta's finding that the majority of promotional response stems from brand switching is supported, the average magnitude of the effect appears to be smaller than first thought. More important, there is ample evidence that promotions have a significant primary demand effect. The relative emphasis on purchase acceleration and brand switching varies systematically across categories, and the second goal of the paper is to explain this variation as a function of exogeneous covariates. In doing this, we recognize that promotional response is the consumer's reaction to a price promotion, and therefore develop a framework for understanding variability in promotional response that is based on the consumer's perspective of the benefits from a price promotion. These benefits are posited to be a function of: (i) category-specific factors, (ii) brand-specific factors, and (iii) consumer characteristics. The framework is formalized as a generalized least squares meta-analysis in which the brand's price elasticity is the dependent variable. Several interesting results emerge from this analysis. • Category-specific factors, brand-specific factors, and consumer demographics explain a significant amount of the variance in promotional response for a brand at both the primary and secondary demand levels. • Category-specific factors have greater influence on variability in promotional response and its decomposition than do brand-specific factors. • There are several instances where exogenous variables do not affect total elasticities yet significantly affect individual components of total elasticity. In fact, the lack of a significant relationship between the variables and total elasticity is often due to offsetting effects within two or more of the three behavioral components of elasticity. This is particularly true for brand-specific factors, which typically have no effect on total elasticity, yet have important effects on the individual behaviors. • There is some evidence to suggest that not all promotion-related increases in primary demand are due to forward-buying - in some cases promotions appear to increase consumption. We use these results to illustrate how category-and brand-specific factors work to drive primary and secondary demand elasticities in different directions. In short, this paper offers an empirical generalization of a key finding on promotional response - how elasticities decompose across brand choice, purchase incidence, and stockpiling - and new insights into factors that explain variance in promotional response. These findings are likely to be of interest to researchers who are concerned with theory development and the generalizability of marketing phenomena, and to managers who plan promotion campaigns.","Brand choice; Meta-analysis; Price elasticity; Primary demand; Promotion; Purchase incidence; Secondary demand; Stockpiling","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-0033233924"

Structural equation modeling is a powerful tool for dealing with these difficulties using a simultaneous equation framework with unobserved constructs and manifest indicators which are error-prone. When estimating structural equation models, however, researchers frequently treat the data as if they were collected from a single population (Muthén 1989). This assumption of homogeneity is often unrealistic. For example, in multidimensional expectancy value models, consumers from different market segments can have different belief structures (Bagozzi 1982). Research in satisfaction suggests that consumer decision processes vary across segments (Day 1977). This paper shows that aggregate analysis which ignores heterogeneity in structural equation models produces misleading results and that traditional fit statistics are not useful for detecting unobserved heterogeneity in the data. Furthermore, sequential analyses that first form groups using cluster analysis and then apply multigroup structural equation modeling are not satisfactory. We develop a general finite mixture structural equation model that simultaneously treats heterogeneity and forms market segments in the context of a specified model structure where all the observed variables are measured with error. The model is considerably more general than cluster analysis, multigroup confirmatory factor analysis, and multigroup structural equation modeling. In particular, the model subsumes several specialized models including finite mixture simultaneous equation models, finite mixture confirmatory factor analysis, and finite mixture second-order factor analysis. The finite mixture structural equation model should be of interest to academics in a wide range of disciplines (e.g., Consumer Behavior, Marketing, Economics, Finance, Psychology, and Sociology) where unobserved heterogeneity and measurement error are problematic. In addition, the model should be of interest to market researchers and product managers for two reasons. First, the model allows the manager to perform response-based segmentation using a consumer decision process model, while explicitly allowing for both measurement and structural error. Second, the model allows managers to detect unobserved moderating factors which account for heterogeneity. Once managers have identified the moderating factors, they can link segment membership to observable individual-level characteristics (e.g., sodoeconomic and demographic variables) and improve marketing policy. We applied the finite mixture structural equation model to a direct marketing study of customer satisfaction and estimated a large model with 8 unobserved constructs and 23 manifest indicators. The results show that there are three consumer segments that vary considerably in terms of the importance they attach to the various dimensions of satisfaction. In contrast, aggregate analysis is misleading because it incorrectly suggests that except for price all dimensions of satisfaction are significant for all consumers. Methodologically, the finite mixture model is robust; that is, the parameter estimates are stable under double cross-validation and the method can be used to test large models. Furthermore, the double cross-validation results show that the finite mixture model is superior to sequential data analysis strategies in terms of goodness-of-fit and interpretability. We performed four simulation experiments to test the robustness of the algorithm using both recursive and nonrecursive model specifications. Specifically, we examined the robustness of different model selection criteria (e.g., CAIC, BIC, and GFI) in choosing the correct number of clusters for exactly identified and overidentified models assuming that the distributional form is correctly specified. We also examined the effect of distributional misspecification (i.e., departures from multivariate normality) on model performance. The results show that when the data are heterogeneous, the standard goodness-of-fit statistics for the aggregate model are not useful for detecting heterogeneity. Furthermore, parameter recovery is poor. For the finite mixture model, however, the BIC and CAIC criteria perform well in detecting heterogeneity and in identifying the true number of segments. In particular, parameter recovery for both the measurement and structural models is highly satisfactory. The finite mixture method is robust to distributional misspecification; in addition, the method significantly outperforms aggregate and sequential data analysis methods when the form of heterogeneity is misspeafied (i.e., the true model has random coefficients). Researchers and practitioners should only use the mixture methodology when substantive theory supports the structural equation model, a priori segmentation is infeasible, and theory suggests that the data are heterogeneous and belong to a finite number of unobserved groups. We expect these conditions to hold in many social science applications and, in particular, market segmentation studies. Future research should focus on large-scale simulation studies to test the structural equation mixture model using a wide range of models and statistical distributions. Theoretical research should extend the model by allowing the mixing proportions to depend on prior information and/or subject-specific variables. Finally, in order to provide a fuller treatment of heterogeneity, we need to develop a general random coefficient structural equation model. Such a model is presently unavailable in the statistical and psychometric literatures.","Confirmatory factor analysis; Customer satisfaction; Finite mixture models; Market segmentation; Structural equation models","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0031287762"

Starting from a general overview of the emerging trends today affecting the fashion industry, the paper will devote particular attention to the analysis of the most important phenomena that are influencing this market and the drivers for long-lasting competitiveness: sustainability and attention to the so-called circular economy. According to the literature, from the consumer behavior's point of view, the younger generations are paying growing attention to these issues. In light of these considerations, this paper aimed to analyze how sustainability and circular economy principles are influencing the perception of the fashion world among the new generations of consumers. After mapping the emerging trends in the fashion industry and analyzing the role of sustainability from both the demand and supply side, this paper presents the results of a survey conducted through an anonymous questionnaire made in collaboration with Insubria University. The results of the survey describe the students' behaviour as regards fashion's emerging trends, with particular attention to sustainability issues and the application of circular economy principles. The survey results were analyzed from both a descriptive and quantitative point of view with the aim to check the different perceptions as regards sustainable fashion and circular economy in fashion, focusing mainly on the so-called Generation Z. The results of the analysis proved to be consistent with the theoretical framework and confirm the relevance of sustainability issues in the fashion industry today in driving the demand of Generation Z, by considering a gender perspective. Moreover, the circular economy is descriptively analyzed with the aim to understand the relevance of the different facets for the entire sample of respondents. © 2020 by the authors.","Circular economy; Fashion industry; Sustainability; Trends; Young generations","Insubria; business; competition (economics); competitiveness; consumption behavior; economic system; gender; lifestyle; perception; qualitative analysis; questionnaire survey; sustainability; textile industry; trend analysis","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85083653216"

Using mobile apps typically requires the disclosure of location data, which often accompanies requests for various other forms of private information. Existing research on information privacy has implied that consumers are willing to accept privacy risks for relatively negligible benefits, and the offerings of mobile apps based on location-based services (LBS) appear to be no different. However, until now, researchers have struggled to replicate realistic privacy risks within experimental methodologies designed to manipulate independent variables. Moreover, minimal research has successfully captured actual information disclosure over mobile devices based on realistic risk perceptions. The purpose of this study is to propose and test a more realistic experimental methodology designed to replicate real perceptions of privacy risk and capture the effects of actual information disclosure decisions. As with prior research, this study employs a theoretical lens based on privacy calculus. However, we draw more detailed and valid conclusions due to our use of improved methodological rigor. We report the results of a controlled experiment involving consumers (n=1025) in a range of ages, levels of education, and employment experience.

Based upon these changes in technology and consumer expectations, important elements of the e-service experience are defined. The paper concludes by showing how e-service strategies will play a significant role in growing the overall value of the firm.

Second, we highlight the importance of certain modeling assumptions in predicting when commitment devices will be demanded and examine the laboratory and field evidence on the demand for commitment devices. Third, we present the evidence on both informal and formal commitment devices, and we conclude with a discussion of policy implications, including sin taxes, consumer protection, and commitment device design.

This article shows that the use of different payment mechanisms influences both these factors and hence moderates the effects of past payments on future spending. Specifically, past payments strongly reduce purchase intention when the payment mechanism requires the consumer to write down the amount paid (rehearsal) and when the consumer's wealth is depleted immediately rather than with a delay (immediacy).

They assessed concentration of attention through eye tracking and viewer retention by recording zapping behavior. This allows tests of predictions about the interplay of these emotions and interperson attention differences at each point in time during exposure. Surprise and joy effectively concentrate attention and retain viewers. However, importantly, the level rather than the velocity of surprise affects attention concentration most, whereas the velocity rather than the level of joy affects viewer retention most. The effect of joy is asymmetric, with higher gains for increases than losses for decreases.

Because of its importance to management and lack of attention in the marketing literature, specific emphasis is placed on the phenomenon of noncomplaining and the role of consumer emotion in dissatisfying marketplace experiences. The model presents cognitive appraisal as the key element in the evaluation of consumer threat and harm, which subsequently may result in psychological stress. Stressful appraisal outcomes are suggested to elicit emotive reactions that, in conjunction with cognitive appraisal, influence the type of coping strategy used by the consumer. Three coping strategies (problem focused, emotion focused, and avoidance) are identified and discussed. Key propositions are illustrated by using in-depth interview data from a sample of older female consumers.

Findings from an empirical study regarding the case of French luxury clothing indicate that incorporating recycled materials in such goods affects consumer preferences negatively and reveals a certain incompatibility between recycling and the category of luxury products. Despite the increasing concerns of consumers about the preservation of the planet, the responsible behavior of the brand remains a secondary selection criterion and consumers of luxury goods primarily focus on the intrinsic quality of the product. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","Conjoint analysis; Consumer preference; Luxury products; Recycling; Sustainable development; Textile","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84878664542"

However, the suitability of the prevalent information formats in supporting various online shopping tasks is not known. Using the cognitive fit theory as the theoretical framework, we developed a research model to investigate the fit between information format and shopping task, and examine its influence on consumers' online shopping performance and perceptions of shopping experience. The competition for attention theory from the marketing literature and the scanpath theory from vision research were employed to support the analyses. An experiment was conducted to examine the effects of two types of information formats (list versus matrix) in the context of two types of shopping tasks (searching versus browsing). The results show that when there is a match between the information format and the shopping task, consumers can search the information space more efficiently and have better recall of product information. Specifically, the list format better supports browsing tasks, and the matrix format facilitates searching tasks. However, a match between the information format and the shopping task has no effect on cognitive effort or attitude toward using the Web site. Overall, this research supports the application of the cognitive fit theory to the study of Web interface design. It also demonstrates the value in integrating findings from cognitive science and vision research to understand the processes involved. As the information format has been shown to affect consumers' online shopping behavior, even when the information content is held constant, the practical implications for Web site designers include providing both types of information format on their Web sites and matching the appropriate information format to the individual consumer's task. © 2005 M.E.

Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses a conceptual approach that is rooted in the service, tourism and hospitality, and strategy literature. Findings: First, this paper defines key types of platform business models in the sharing economy anddescribes their characteristics. In particular, the authors propose the differentiation between sharing platforms of capacity-constrained vs capacity-unconstrained assets and advance five core properties of the former. Second, the authors contrast platform business models with their pipeline business model counterparts to understand the fundamental differences between them. One important conclusion is that platforms cater to vastly more heterogeneous assets and consumer needs and, therefore, require liquidity and analytics for high-quality matching. Third, the authors examine the competitive position of platforms and conclude that their widely taken “winner takes it all” assumption is not valid. Primary network effects are less important once a critical level of liquidity has been reached and may even turn negative if increased listings raise friction in the form of search costs. Once a critical level of liquidity has been reached, a platform’s competitive position depends on stakeholder trust and service provider and user loyalty. Fourth, the authors integrate and synthesize the literature on key platform stakeholders of platform businesses (i.e. users, service providers, and regulators) and their roles and motivations. Finally, directions for further research are advanced. Practical implications: This paper helps platform owners, service providers and users understand better the implications of sharing platform business models and how to position themselves in such ecosystems. Originality/value: This paper integrates the extant literature on sharing platforms, takes a novel approach in delineating their key properties and dimensions, and provides insights into the evolving and dynamic forms of sharing platforms including converging business models. © 2019, Jochen Wirtz, Kevin Kam Fung So, Makarand Amrish Mody, Stephanie Q.

Take-back laws require that firms take responsibility for the collection/disposal costs of their products. We consider two alternative implementations of take-back laws that are distinguished by the degree of control that the manufacturer has on returns sold to the remanufacturer. In one implementation, known as collective WEEE take-back, the manufacturer has no control over returns sold to the remanufacturer. The other implementation, known as individual WEEE take-back, gives complete control to the manufacturer. We develop a general two-period model to investigate questions of interest to policy-makers in government and managers in industry. Our results suggest that, in some settings, enactment of collective WEEE take-back will result in higher manufacturer and remanufacturer profits while simultaneously spurring remanufacturing activity and reducing the tax burden on society. A negative effect is higher consumer prices in the market. In other settings, we find that collective WEEE take-back introduces a structural change to the industry-creating an environment where remanufacturing becomes profitable when it is not profitable without a take-back law. With respect to individual WEEE take-back, we find that the manufacturer often benefits from allowing the remanufacturer to enter the market, though from a government policy-maker perspective, there are clear risks of monopolistic behavior. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Design/methodology/approach - This paper draws on a non-probability quota sample of 660 respondents to explore the attitudes and behaviour of Greek consumers towards organic food products. Findings - Greek consumers seem to be informed about environmental and health issues. They seek information about the nutritional value of food and demand more products free from chemical residues. The results show that most consumers associate organic consumption mainly with fruit and vegetables. Although demographics seem to affect attitudes towards organics, their value in explaining actual behaviour is minimal. Research limitations/implications - It is recognized that the data gathered in this study focus on the metropolitan area of Thessaloniki, Greece. The specific area though, is considered to be representative of the total Greek population. The results confirm that health, concern for the environment, animal welfare and support of the local economy are drivers of organic consumption. However, there is an indication that the importance of motives and barriers may vary for different product categories and perhaps future research should focus on product segmentation. Practical implications - Although certain similarities in consumers' attitudes towards organic food products have been identified, this paper records the variation in behaviour towards organics among the various consumer groups examined in Greece, and highlights the gap between attitudes and actual behaviour. Given the complexity of consumer decision making, future research should explore the other value trade-offs that consumers make.

The future evolution of the scale and character of the energy system will be fundamentally shaped by socioeconomic conditions and drivers, available energy resources, technologies of energy supply and transformation, and end-use energy demand. However, because energy-related activities are significant sources of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and other environmental and social externalities, energy system development will also be influenced by social acceptance and strategic policy choices. All of these uncertainties have important implications for many aspects of economic and environmental sustainability, and climate change in particular. In the Shared-Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) framework these uncertainties are structured into five narratives, arranged according to the challenges to climate change mitigation and adaptation. In this study we explore future energy sector developments across the five SSPs using Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs), and we also provide summary output and analysis for selected scenarios of global emissions mitigation policies. The mitigation challenge strongly corresponds with global baseline energy sector growth over the 21st century, which varies between 40% and 230% depending on final energy consumer behavior, technological improvements, resource availability and policies. The future baseline CO2-emission range is even larger, as the most energy-intensive SSP also incorporates a comparatively high share of carbon-intensive fossil fuels, and vice versa. Inter-regional disparities in the SSPs are consistent with the underlying socioeconomic assumptions; these differences are particularly strong in the SSPs with large adaptation challenges, which have little inter-regional convergence in long-term income and final energy demand levels. The scenarios presented do not include feedbacks of climate change on energy sector development. The energy sector SSPs with and without emissions mitigation policies are introduced and analyzed here in order to contribute to future research in climate sciences, mitigation analysis, and studies on impacts, adaptation and vulnerability. © 2016 The Authors","Energy demand; Energy resources; Energy supply; Energy system; Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs); Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs)","carbon emission; climate change; consumption behavior; demand analysis; economic activity; emission control; energy budget; energy policy; energy resource; energy use; fossil fuel; integrated approach; resource availability; socioeconomic conditions; strategic approach; sustainability; twenty first century","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84990019816"

In a subsequent regression analysis, we utilize the lifestyle segments contained in the dataset to control for aspects of behavioral differences related to lifestyles in an analysis of the impact of various socioeconomic variables on CO2 emissions, such as individual aspirations and people's attitudes toward the environment, as well as the physical context in which people act.This approach enables us to (1) test for the significance of lifestyles in determining CO2 emissions, (2) quantify the importance of a variety of individual socioeconomic determinants, and (3) provide a visual representation of "" where"" the various factors exert the greatest impact, by exploiting the spatial information contained in the lifestyle data.Our results indicate the importance of consumer behavior and lifestyles in understanding CO2 emissions in the United Kingdom. Across lifestyle groups, CO2 emissions can vary by a factor of between 2 and 3. Our regression results provide support for the idea that sociodemographic variables are important in explaining emissions. For instance, controlling for lifestyles and other determinants, we find that emissions are increasing with income and decreasing with education.

Understanding peer influence is critical to estimating product demand and diffusion, creating effective viral marketing, and designing ""network interventions"" to promote positive social change. But several statistical challenges make it difficult to econometrically identify peer influence in networks. Though some recent studies use experiments to identify influence, they have not investigated the social or structural conditions under which influence is strongest. By randomly manipulating messages sent by adopters of a Facebook application to their 1.3 million peers, we identify the moderating effect of tie strength and structural embeddedness on the strength of peer influence. We find that both embeddedness and tie strength increase influence. However, the amount of physical interaction between friends, measured by coappearance in photos, does not have an effect. This work presents some of the first large-scale in vivo experimental evidence investigating the social and structural moderators of peer influence in networks. The methods and results could enable more effective marketing strategies and social policy built around a new understanding of how social structure and peer influence spread behaviors in society. © 2014 INFORMS.","Information systems; Peer influence; Randomized experiment; Social contagion; Social networks; Viral marketing","Commerce; Experiments; Information systems; Marketing; Product design; Social networking (online); Experimental evidence; Facebook applications; Network interventions; Peer influence; Physical interactions; Randomized experiments; Social contagion; Viral marketing; Economic and social effects","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84902274479"

Design/methodology/approach: A total of 666 respondents from the most economically developed cities in Brazil were surveyed. The sample comprised 333 mobile banking users and 333 mobile banking non-users. Partial least squares was used to analyze the proposed framework's construct relations. Findings: The framework offers an integrated view, taking into account more predictors than other studies on the adoption of innovations. For non-users, the framework was able to explain approximately 69 percent of the dependent variable (intention to adopt mobile banking) variation, which is a figure higher than those obtained in previous studies. However, for current users of mobile banking, only 27 percent of the dependent variable variation was explained by the framework. It was also observed that the predictors' influence over the criterion variable was different for each group of mobile banking users and non-users. Originality/value: The findings suggest that the proposed integrated framework offers a deeper understanding of the variables that influence the adoption of mobile banking. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Banking; Brazil; Consumer behaviour; Innovation; Least square approximation; Mobile communication systems","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-77954837945"

Socially conscious consumer behaviour, like its ecological counterpart, appears to be an expression of pro-social values. In contrast, frugal consumer behaviour relates primarily to low personal materialism and income constraints.

This paper presents the results of a study conducted among 500 Cypriot consumers, focusing on the factors that shape consumer environmental attitudes and behaviour, as well as on the resulting outcomes. The findings confirmed that both the inward and outward environmental attitudes of a consumer are positively influenced by his/her degree of collectivism, long-term orientation, political involvement, deontology, and law obedience, but have no connection with liberalism. The adoption of an inward environmental attitude was also found to be conducive to green purchasing behaviour that ultimately leads to high product satisfaction. On the other hand, an outward environmental attitude facilitates the adoption of a general environmental behaviour, which is responsible for greater satisfaction with life. The findings of the study have important implications for shaping effective company offerings to consumers in target markets, as well as formulating appropriate policies at the governmental level to enhance environmental sensitivity among citizens. © 2010 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","Buyer satisfaction; Consumer behaviour; Environmental marketing","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-79958120531"

Sandra Calvert addresses product marketing to children and shows that although marketers have targeted children for decades, two recent trends have increased their interest in child consumers. First, both the discretionary income of children and their power to influence parent purchases have increased over time. Second, as the enormous increase in the number of available television channels has led to smaller audiences for each channel, digital interactive technologies have simultaneously opened new routes to narrow cast to children, thereby creating a growing media space just for children and children's products. Calvert explains that paid advertising to children primarily involves television spots that feature toys and food products, most of which are high in fat and sugar and low in nutritional value. Newer marketing approaches have led to online advertising and to so-called stealth marketing techniques, such as embedding products in the program content in films, online, and in video games. All these marketing strategies, says Calvert, make children younger than eight especially vulnerable because they lack the cognitive skills to understand the persuasive intent of television and online advertisements. The new stealth techniques can also undermine the consumer defenses even of older children and adolescents. Calvert explains that government regulations implemented by the Federal Communications Commission and the Federal Trade Commission provide some protection for children from advertising and marketing practices. Regulators exert more control over content on scarce television airwaves that belong to the public than over content on the more open online spaces. Overall, Calvert concludes, children live and grow up in a highly sophisticated marketing environment that influences their preferences and behaviors.","","Adolescent; Advertising as Topic; Child; Child Behavior; Child Development; Child Psychology; Child, Preschool; Government Regulation; Humans; Internet; Mass Media; Parenting; Television; United States; advertizing; child behavior; child development; child parent relation; commercial phenomena; computer program; consumer; economic aspect; family; health hazard; human; Internet; marketing; mass medium; online system; public figure; review; school; television; tobacco; training; United States","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-43549112085"

In the spirit of this idea, in 2002 Ireland introduced a 15 Euro cent tax on plastic shopping bags, previously provided free of charge to customers at points of sale. The effect of the tax on the use of plastic bags in retail outlets has been dramatic-a reduction in use in the order of 90%, and an associated gain in the form of reduced littering and negative landscape effects. Costs of administration have been very low, amounting to about 3% of revenues, because it was possible to integrate reporting and collection into existing Value Added Tax reporting systems. Response from the main stakeholders: the public and the retail industry, has been overwhelmingly positive. Central to this acceptance has been a policy of extensive consultation with these stakeholders. The fact that a product tax can influence consumer behaviour significantly will be of interest to many policymakers in this area.

By leveraging a systematic literature review using a data-driven approach and quantitative methodology (including bibliographic coupling), this study provides an overview of the emerging intellectual structure of AI research in the three bodies of literature examined. We identified eight topical clusters: (1) memory and computational logic; (2) decision making and cognitive processes; (3) neural networks; (4) machine learning and linguistic analysis; (5) social media and text mining; (6) social media content analytics; (7) technology acceptance and adoption; and (8) big data and robots. Furthermore, we identified a total of 412 theoretical lenses used in these studies with the most frequently used being: (1) the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology; (2) game theory; (3) theory of mind; (4) theory of planned behavior; (5) computational theories; (6) behavioral reasoning theory; (7) decision theories; and (8) evolutionary theory. Finally, we propose a research agenda to advance the scholarly debate on AI in the three literatures studied with an emphasis on cross-fertilization of theories used across fields, and neglected research topics. © 2021 The Authors.

While the adoption of social technology is well studied, new theoretical development is needed to explain the specific characteristics of s-commerce and their interactions with the user. This study analyses consumer behaviours in s-commerce, focusing on the role of social influence in s-commerce. A model is created to validate the relationship between the subjective norm and trust, social support, attitude, and intention. The results of the model show that the subjective norm is a key behavioural antecedent to use s-commerce. In the extended model, the moderating and mediating effects of the subjective norm on relationships among variables were found to be significant. The new set of variables adapted from previous research can be s-commerce-specific, acting as factors that enhance attitudes and behavioural intentions in s-commerce. The implications of the findings are discussed in terms of building a theory of social interaction and providing practical insights into developing user-centered s-commerce as a platform. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","adoption; e-commerce; mediating effects; moderating effects; social commerce; social marketing","Commerce; Electronic commerce; Speech processing; adoption; Extended model; Mediating effect; Moderating effect; New forms; Social influence; Social interactions; Social media; Social support; Subjective norm; Theoretical development; User experience; User-centered; Economic and social effects","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84873376058"

The examination is based on the theory of consumption values and uses the fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis. The results show that the functional value is almost always necessary but is not sufficient by itself for predicting green buying. However, three ""causal recipes"" formed with the functional value are sufficient. These recipes use the emotional, conditional and social values combined individually with the functional value. Other three combinations of consumption values are also sufficient for predicting green buying. In contrast, the absence of the functional value is a sufficient condition for not green buying, as well as three other ""causal recipes"". This finding can help marketing managers develop appropriate strategies.

We structurally estimate a dynamic model of consumer choice using two years of scanner data on the purchasing behavior of a panel of households. The results suggest that static demand estimates, which neglect dynamics, (i) overestimate own-price elasticities by 30 percent, (ii) underestimate cross-price elasticities by up to a factor of 5, and (iii) overestimate the substitution to the no-purchase or outside option by over 200 percent. This suggests that policy analysis based on static elasticity estimates will underestimate price-cost margins and underpredict the effects of mergers.","Demand anticipation; Differentiated products; Discrete choice models; Long-run price elasticities; Stockpiling; Storable goods","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-33750573082"

These consumers rationally choose to only sporadically update their information and re-compute their optimal consumption plans. In between updating dates, they remain inattentive. This behavior implies that news disperses slowly throughout the population, so events have a gradual and delayed effect on aggregate consumption. The model predicts that aggregate consumption adjusts slowly to shocks, and is able to explain the excess sensitivity and excess smoothness puzzles. In addition, individual consumption is sensitive to ordinary and unexpected past news, but it is not sensitive to extraordinary or predictable events. The model further predicts that some people rationally choose to not plan, live hand-to-mouth, and save less, while other people sporadically update their plans. The longer are these plans, the more they save. Evidence using U.S. aggregate and microeconomic data generally supports these predictions. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The current study seeks to explicate this gap by examining the drivers of green apparel buying behaviour. Towards this end, the study examines the association of environmental knowledge, green trust, and environmental concern with environmental attitude and green apparel buying behaviour. It further investigates the association of labelling desire and labelling satisfaction with this type of buying behaviour as well. In addition, the study uses the theoretical lens of the knowledge-attitude-behaviour model and attitude-behaviour-context theory to anchor its hypotheses. Cross-sectional data from 387 Japanese consumers analysed to test the conceptual model revealed that green trust, environmental attitude, and labelling satisfaction are positively associated with green apparel buying behaviour. Furthermore, green trust, environmental concern, and environmental attitude partially mediate the proposed associations, while age and gender moderate the association between environmental knowledge and environmental concern. The study's empirical insights thus lay the foundation for future research in this area and provide strategically relevant inferences for green apparel marketers and retailers. © 2020 The Author(s)","Attitude-behaviour gap; Environmental knowledge; Green apparel; Labelling desire; Labelling satisfaction; Structural equation modeling","consumption behavior; environmental values; knowledge; multivariate analysis; public attitude; retailing","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097453373"

Following two complementary approaches, this study conceptualizes innovativeness at two levels of abstraction: general innovativeness (GI), that is, the degree of openness to newness; and specific innovativeness (SI), that is, the predisposition to be among the firsts to adopt innovations in a specific domain. This study measures GI and SI on a sample of SME entrepreneurs by using two different scales that are based on inventories extensively used in this field (i.e., the KAI [Kirton, J.M., 1976. Adaptors and innovators: a description and measure. Journal of Applied Psychology 61 (5), 622-629; Kirton, J.M., 2003. Adaption-Innovation in the Context of Diversity and Change. Routledge, London] and DSI [Goldsmith, R.E., Hofacker, C.F., 1991. Measuring consumer innovativeness. Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science 19 (3), 209-222] inventories) and tests their effects on the entrepreneurs' intention to adopt innovations. Secondly, this study relates entrepreneurs' innovativeness (both GI and SI) to their basic personality traits as assessed through the Five-Factor Model of human personality (cf. [Digman, J.M., 1990. Personality structure: emergence of the five-factor model. Annual Review of Psychology 41 (1), 417-440; McCrae, R.R., John, O.P., 1992. An introduction to the five-factor model and its implications. Journal of Personality 60 (2), 1-26]). Finally, it compares the predictive power of both GI and SI on the entrepreneurs' intention to adopt innovations against that of a cognitive model that represents the framework of reference in this field (i.e., the Theory of Planned Behavior [Ajzen, I., 1991. The theory of planned behavior. Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes 50 (2), 179-211]).

Yet, the broader experiential and brand-related impact of AR remains unclear, as much existing research adopts an app-centric perspective focused on consumers’ motivations for and reactions to using AR applications. The current article takes a more holistic approach to examine what consumer-brand relationships can be facilitated through augmented reality. Through an ethnographic study of how consumers use Sephora's mobile AR shopping app in their own homes, we find that a close and intimate (rather than transactional) relationship can emerge due to how the branded AR app is incorporated into consumers’ intimate space and their sense of self. This study thus broadens the focus of AR research from the immediate physical context into which virtual information is embedded, to the wider spatial-symbolic context of where consumers use AR apps, as well as to the inner context of how self-augmentations are integrated into consumers’ self-concepts. © 2018","Augmented reality; Brand; Consumer-brand relationship; Engagement; Mobile marketing; Retail","conceptual framework; consumption behavior; holistic approach; marketing; reliability analysis; retailing; shopping activity","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85047428135"

Five experiments found that individuals experiencing a state of power spent more money on themselves than on others, whereas those experiencing a state of powerlessness spent more money on others than on themselves. This effect was observed using a variety of power manipulations (hierarchical roles, print advertisements, episodic recall, and mental role-playing), across spending intentions and actual dollars spent, and among college and national samples. We propose that this effect occurs because power and powerlessness affect the psychological utility of self versus others, and this in turn affects the monetary worth allocated to spending on self versus others.

We argue that decreasing financial resources resulting from substantial performance shortfalls and the absence or availability of slack resources together affect the emphasis on different types of organizational change in response to performance shortfalls. Using data on the acquisition and divestment behavior of 530 companies in the information and communications technology sector from 1992 to 2014, we find that the frequency of resource-consuming acquisitions and of resource-freeing divestments are affected differently by performance below aspirations and that these relationships are moderated by the level of financial slack. Managerial summary: This paper examines whether firms respond to performance shortfalls with acquisitions or divestments. We argue and show that the closer the firm is to the aspired level of performance, the more likely it is to respond with resource-consuming acquisitions to close the performance gap, whereas the further it is from aspired performance, the more likely the firm is to respond with divestments to free resources. Financial slack weakens these relationships between performance relative to aspirations and acquisitions or divestments such that it increases the likelihood of a response through acquisitions while it reduces the likelihood of a response through divestments.

The results also indicate that reputation has a large impact on the willingness to pay of consumers, that long term reputation is considerably more important than short term quality movements, and that consumers react slowly to changes in product quality. Collective reputation is shown to have an impact on consumer willingness to pay that is as large as that of individual firm reputation.

As one of the first demonstration and promotion cities for EVs in China, Beijing has played an important leading role in the promotion of EVs. Based on the theory of planned behavior (TPB), this study introduced consumer cognitive status, product perception, and incentive policy measures (non-monetary incentive policy measures and monetary incentive policy measures) to build a purchase intention influence mechanism model for EVs. A questionnaire survey was conducted from March to April of 2018 among potential consumers in Beijing. A total of 502 valid survey responses were obtained, and a structural equation model (SEM) was used for an empirical analysis of the factors influencing EV purchasing intention. The results show that attitude, perceived behavior control, cognitive status, product perception and monetary incentive policy measures have significant positive effects on consumers’ intentions to purchase EVs in Beijing. However, subjective norms and non-monetary incentive policy measures have no significant impact on purchasing intention. In addition, the analysis results of the multi-group SEM show that there are significant differences in demographic variables (gender, age, education level, income, and ownership of cars) in the path of consumer purchase intention.

The purpose of this paper is two-fold: first, a state-of-the-art review of consumer animosity research is presented and specific issues for future research on consumer animosity are raised. Second, potential problems associated with the measurement of consumer animosity are highlighted and an alternative perspective for operationalizing the construct is proposed. Design/methodology/approach - First, a critical literature review on empirical consumer animosity studies is undertaken. Second, exploratory empirical results are presented, based on unprompted questioning, to identify both targets of animosity by Austrian consumers and underlying reasons for such animosity. Third, a MIMIC model overcoming the shortcomings of the current operationalizations of the consumer animosity construct is proposed. Findings - The exploratory study on Austrian consumers demonstrates that animosity targets of consumers cannot be considered as being given, i.e. consumers differ in their animosity targets, and there may be a number of (different) reasons causing animosity feelings such as economic, political, religious or personal. Originality/value - This paper reveals a set of problematic issues in current consumer animosity research and offers concrete approaches to overcome the latter. In particular, a formative measurement approach consistent with the conceptual definition of the construct is suggested and described. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Consumer behaviour; International business; Market research","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-33847005872"

It relies on rich field data from one of the world’s largest telecom providers who can gauge physical crowdedness in real-time in terms of the number of active mobile users in subway trains. The telecom provider randomly sent targeted mobile ads to individual users, measured purchase rates, and surveyed purchasers and nonpurchasers. Based on a sample of 14,972 mobile phone users, the results suggest that, counterintuitively, commuters in crowded subway trains are about twice as likely to respond to a mobile offer by making a purchase vis-à-vis those in noncrowded trains. On average, the purchase rates measured 2.1% with fewer than two people per square meter, and increased to 4.3% with five people per square meter, after controlling for peak and off-peak times, weekdays and weekends, mobile use behaviors, and randomly sending mobile ads to users. The effects are robust to exploiting sudden variations in crowdedness induced by unanticipated train delays underground and street closures aboveground. Follow-up surveys provide insights into the causal mechanism driving this result. A plausible explanation is mobile immersion: As increased crowding invades one’s physical space, people adaptively turn inwards and become more susceptible to mobile ads. Because crowding is often associated with negative emotions such as anxiety and risk-avoidance, the findings reveal an intriguing, positive aspect of crowding: Mobile ads can be a welcome relief in a crowded subway environment. The findings have economic significance because people living in cities commute 48 minutes each way on average, and global mobile ad spending is projected to exceed $100 billion. Marketers may consider the crowdedness of a consumer’s environment as a new way to boost the effectiveness of hyper-contextual mobile advertising. © 2016 INFORMS.","Crowdedness; Field study; Hyper-contextual targeting; Mobile advertising; New technology","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84961720972"

The main aim of the paper is to propose a methodological framework within which the impact of characteristics of a tourism product on foreign travel can be captured and analysed. This is achieved by combining the Lancasterian product characteristics approach with the Koppelman's consumer transportation model. Within the proposed model the characteristics of the tourism product/destination including quality of service, advertising and political instability are combined to generate a perception/feeling regarding the tourism destination in the mind of the tourists. In order to measure these perceptions/feelings and, hence, develop a preference ordering, the model is estimated by utilising a conditional Logit analysis. The analysis is based on primary data collected from tourists visiting Cyprus. The conditional Logit model generates the probability of revisit given the characteristics of tourists and the Cyprus tourism product. The paper extends further the Lancaster product characteristics framework as applied to tourism by Rugg (Rev. Econom. Stat. 55(1) (1973) 64), Morley (Ann. Tourism Res. 19 (1992) 250) and Papatheodorou (Ann. Tourism Res. 28 (2001) 164) by including the neglected but from any viewpoint important political instability characteristics that is attached to the tourist product of Cyprus. The inclusion of product characteristics/attributes in tourism analysis appear to strongly contribute towards the better understanding of travel choice behaviour. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

These driverless technologies will create an unprecedented revolution in how people move, and policymakers will need appropriate tools to plan for and analyze the large impacts of novel navigation systems.

We use data from a nationwide online panel of 1260 individuals who answered a vehicle-purchase discrete choice experiment focused on energy efficiency and autonomous features. Several models were estimated with the choice microdata, including a conditional logit with deterministic consumer heterogeneity, a parametric random parameter logit, and a semiparametric random parameter logit. We draw three key results from our analysis. First, we find that the average household is willing to pay a significant amount for automation: about $3500 for partial automation and $4900 for full automation. Second, we estimate substantial heterogeneity in preferences for automation, where a significant share of the sample is willing to pay above $10,000 for full automation technology while many are not willing to pay any positive amount for the technology. Third, our semiparametric random parameter logit estimates suggest that the demand for automation is split approximately evenly between high, modest and no demand, highlighting the importance of modeling flexible preferences for emerging vehicle technology. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Autonomous vehicle technology; Discrete choice models; Semiparametric heterogeneity; Willingness to pay","Automation; Digital storage; Energy efficiency; Navigation systems; Parameter estimation; Automation technology; Autonomous vehicle technologies; Communication technologies; Discrete choice experiments; Discrete choice models; Semiparametric; Vehicle technology; Willingness to pay; automation; consumption behavior; discrete choice analysis; energy efficiency; navigation; technology adoption; transportation technology; unmanned vehicle; willingness to pay; Autonomous vehicles","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85015045612"

Nonconforming behaviors, as costly and visible signals, can act as a particular form of conspicuous consumption and lead to positive inferences of status and competence in the eyes of others. A series of studies demonstrates that people confer higher status and competence to non-conforming rather than conforming individuals. These positive inferences derived from signals of nonconformity are mediated by perceived autonomy and moderated by individual differences in need for uniqueness in the observers. An investigation of boundary conditions demonstrates that the positive inferences disappear when the observer is unfamiliar with the environment, when the nonconforming behavior is depicted as unintentional, and in the absence of expected norms and shared standards of formal conduct. © 2014 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84901244460"

A convenience sampling method was employed. A total of 600 self-administered questionnaires were distributed during lectures in a large Australian university. In total, 256 useable Australian consumer responses were collected and used for analysis. The results show that the three antecedents of ecoliteracy, interpersonal influence and value orientation have strong correlations with attitudes towards environmentally friendly products. Consumers with favourable attitudes towards environmentally friendly products are more likely to purchase environmentally friendly products. Perceived product necessity moderates the relationship between attitudes toward environmentally friendly products and the willingness to purchase environmentally friendly products. Longitudinal studies can be conducted in the future. Other possible moderating factors such as product involvement or pricing can also be explored. A wider range of behavioural indicators can be used to capture a more accurate measurement of environmentally oriented behaviours. Consumer education about the environment is crucial for consumers to form a more favourable mindset towards environmentally friendly products. Communication initiatives that highlight various environmental support campaigns and environmentally conscious product strategies are some of the ways to encourage purchasing behaviour. The study empirically examines the antecedents and consequences of attitudes towards purchasing green products in an Australian context.

The 300-years old industrial and modern paradigm of ruthless and selfish exploitation of natural resources has separated us from nature and ultimately ourselves to such an extent that the crises of our economic, political, environmental, social and healthcare systems do not come at any surprise. Yet, in juxtaposition to (post)modern pessimistic views, the positive transmodern paradigm shift with its holistic perspectives and practices can be observed. Led by ‘the silent revolution’ of cultural creatives, new worlds are emerging, although still kept at the margins. ‘Transformative travel and tourism’ as an ever-growing trend, appears to be an important medium through which these cultural creatives reinvent themselves and the world they live in. Inner transformation is reflected in the outer world. New ways of being, knowing and doing in the world are emerging as conscious citizens, consumers, producers, travellers, entrepreneurs, and community leaders are calling and acting upon the necessary transformation towards the regenerative paradigm and regenerative economic systems. Based on the natural cycles of renewal and regeneration, this circular approach is underpinned by regenerative land practices. The vision of connecting regenerative agriculture and transformative tourism is offered to reset the global tourism system for good. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","COVID-19; cultural creatives; regenerative agriculture; regenerative economy; silent revolution; transformative travel and tourism; Transmodern paradigm shift","COVID-19; holistic approach; paradigm shift; respiratory disease; tourism development; tourism management; tourism market; travel behavior; viral disease","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85085573280"

In this scenario, emerging countries have contributed to the increasing levels of consumption and environmental effects. Culture and socio-economic status play a significant role in environmental impacts and influences the consumption of green products. The current body of literature lacks studies focused on the attitude of Brazilian consumers in relation to these products. This research evaluates the elements that motivate the consumption of green product. A survey targeting individuals who have consumed these products was performed in the largest city in Southern Brazil. Data were analyzed using a factorial analysis, and a causal structural equation model was created to evaluate the drivers that promote green consumption. The elements of Information and Knowledge, Environmental Attitude, Social Context and Environmental Consciousness were strongly correlated with green consumption. However, the Quality and Price of green products has shown a weaker relationship with consumption. These elements indicated that the individuals in the survey recognize and seek information covering environmental issues, are concerned with the health effects associated with the consumption of the goods, and reject a brand or company that might have demonstrated inappropriate environmental behaviours. Also indicate that the relation price versus quality does not play a central role in the decision of consuming green products. Finally, information about these products and their point-of-sale availability were highlighted as enhancing green consumption. This outcome suggests that education might increase green consumption. This research contributed to understand the main drivers that support the decision about the green products option made for the surveyed sample. From a managerial standpoint, improvements in ethical transactions, the promotion of socially responsible actions, the distribution of appropriate information about green products, and the structure of the green supply chain could create new businesses focused on sustainable production and consumption. The findings of this research could support future policies and actions focused on providing information and knowledge about environmental and health contribution of the green products to the consumers, producers, companies, and society. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The informational landscape is both a repository of data and also increasingly communicates and processes information. No longer confined to desk tops, computers have become both mobile and also disassembled. Many everyday objects now embed computer processing power, while others are activated by passing sensors, transponders and processors. The distributed processing in the world around us is often claimed to be a pervasive or ubiquitous computing environment: a world of ambient intelligence, happening around us on the periphery of our awareness, where our environment is not a passive backdrop but an active agent in organizing daily lives. The spaces around us are now being continually forged and reforged in informational and communicative processes. It is a world where we not only think of cities but cities think of us, where the environment reflexively monitors our behaviour. This paper suggests that we need to unpack the embedded politics of this process. It outlines the three key emerging dynamics in terms of environments that learn and possess anticipation and memory, the efficacy of technological mythologies and the politics of visibility. To examine the assumptions and implications behind this the paper explores three contrasting forms of 'sentient' urban environments. The first addresses market-led visions of customized consumer worlds. The second explores military plans for profiling and targeting. Finally, the third looks at artistic endeavours to re-enchant and contest the urban informational landscape of urban sentience. Each, we suggest, shows a powerful dynamic of the environment tracking, predicting and recalling usage.","Ambient intelligence; Consumers; Embedded politics; Geotagging; Military targeting; Tracking; Ubiquitous computing; Urban art","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-37549011414"

Design/methodology/approach – The data used were collected from a sample of 233 students at Roma-Tre University in Italy. Probit models were specified to identify factors affecting food waste reduction in both pre-shopping and consumption phases. Findings – Results show that the more aware youths are concerning food waste, the more likely they are to reduce leftovers. In contrast, the concern about food freshness increases waste. A greater awareness of the consequences of food wasted increases the likelihood that youths will make a shopping list. Research limitations/implications – The main limitation of the study can be found in the non-probabilistic sampling design used for the collection of data. Practical implications – This study provides information for both social marketers and policy makers. New educational campaigns against food waste should be carried out by providing them with a realistic perception of food waste as well as by teaching young consumers how to recognize the level of freshness of food.

Design/methodology/approach A theoretical model is developed and tested with a sample of car owners in the UK of two global car brands. Structural equation modelling was used with LISREL 8.54 and the maximum likelihood (ML) method. Findings This paper draws mainly on the theory of social identity to provide a comprehensive understanding of conditions under which brand owners are likely to identify with their brand and the bases and consequences of such identification. It was shown that prestige, satisfaction, and communication effect brand identification. The study confirms that consumers' development of relationships via brand identification results in word of mouth about the brand and intentions to repurchase the brand. Furthermore, it was found that brand identification fully mediates the influences of prestige, satisfaction, and communication on word of mouth and brand repurchase. Research limitations/implications The focus was on one country and one industry. Practical implications Managers are provided with strategies that enhance the identification of their customers with their brand so that they can strengthen the customers' brand identification. Areas for future research are suggested. For instance, it could be interesting to test the model in a different industry and/or cultural context. Originality/value Very few previous studies have looked at brand identification which is surprising considering it is such an important variable to influence word-of-mouth and brand repurchase. The study tests three antecedents to brand identification and two outcomes that have not been investigated previously. Overall, the study adds knowledge in this somewhat neglected area. © 2008, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Behaviour; Brand identity; Brand loyalty; Social marketing","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-51849154306"

Perceived risk has generally not been awarded a major role while uncertainty, which is viewed here as distinct from risk, has for the most part been disregarded. The study reported in this paper strives to identify some of the major risks and uncertainties associated with a new service, Internet Banking, during the early stages of its market development. The empirical research involved a qualitative study of a small sample of consumers and a survey of both adopters and non-adopters of Internet Banking. The survey employed a traditional research instrument, which involved the presentation of pre-identified risks and uncertainties. It was possible to identify several major 'risks' as well as 'uncertainties'. We raise questions about whether or not the anxieties and concerns identified by such a process of consumer research are true reflections of the major influences affecting consumer behaviour towards new retail services. The adoption of a 'perceived risk' stance as against one founded on the view that consumers may lack certainty about outcomes and consequences has implications for both theory and practice. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

In the food sector, despite the fact that valuable natural resources are intensively used to produce and distribute food products, little is done to upcycle residues generated along the supply chain. Circular economy strategies are crucial for restructuring the take-make-dispose model through the active participation of all actors of supply chains. However, little is known about consumers' willingness to participate in circular economy. A structured questionnaire was submitted to a representative sample of Italian households to assess the willingness of consumers to be actively involved in closed loops aiming at reducing food waste. Consumers are involved by returning their organic food waste to retailers in exchange for discounts on the purchase of animal products. The organic food waste returned enters in the production process of animal products. A choice experiment was designed to analyse alternative programs. Two scenarios were presented: one with a traditional technology (composting), and a second one with a radically innovative technology (insects as feed). Preferences and trade-offs, in monetary terms, among attributes were computed. Results depict a comprehensive portrait of the potential participation of consumers to closed loops inspired by the principles of circular economy. © 2017 by the authors.","Food sector; Insects as feed; Radical innovation; Recycling","Animalia; Hexapoda; animal product; consumption behavior; economic activity; food industry; food product; food waste; innovation; insect; participatory approach; perception; recycling; strategic approach; waste management","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85011060828"

These dimensions are logical analogues to those in the social psychological literature describing leaders effective at task-oriented behaviors (i.e., those focused on getting the job done) and social-oriented behaviors (i.e., those leaders focused on maintaining group cohesion). A third literature, on gender differences, consistently describes men as agentic (i.e., goal oriented) and women as communal (socially oriented). A synthesis of the ideas from these literatures suggests hypotheses regarding which factors should be most influential to male and female consumers in determining customer satisfaction with service encounters. The results from three experiments provide support for the hypothesis that women may be generally more sensitive to relational aspects of a service encounter and men to core aspects, though there appear to be several factors moderating these findings which are not easily explained in a simple, unified theory. © 1993, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc..

Marketers had no reason to doubt that sentiment, but they have always wondered if consumers would be willing to pay a higher price for ethically produced goods (since they tend to be more expensive to create.) It turns out that a series of controlled experiments proves that consumers will, in fact, pay a premium for ethically produced goods. But perhaps of equal interest is the fact that they will punish (by demanding a lower price) companies that are not seen as ethical. That relationship is not symmetrical. The punishment exacted is greater than the premium customers are willing to pay. How ethical do you have to be? Perhaps not as much as you might think. The research shows that a small degree of ethicalness ""pays off."" It is not necessary for a company's product to be ""100% pure"" in order to receive a price premium. This research is the first to find that consumers use price to punish unethical companies more than they use price to reward ethical companies, and that the ethicality of a company's behavior is, indeed, an important consideration for consumers (as demonstrated in their willingness-to-pay decisions).

We address these issues through an interdisciplinary meta-analysis, generalizing the findings of 114 articles on the impact of FOP labels on outcomes such as consumers’ ability to identify healthier options, product perceptions, purchase behavior, and consumption. The results show that, although FOP labels help consumers to identify healthier products, their ability to nudge consumers toward healthier choices is more limited.

The objective of this paper is to analyse the state of the art regarding consumers’ response to environmentally-friendly food packaging in order to identify existing barriers to purchase and potential measures to overcome these barriers. The paper is based on a systematic synthesis of 46 scientific journal articles on consumer studies related to environmentally-friendly packaging. The literature review applies a conceptual framework regarding the ways consumers respond to product stimuli and the psychological processes involved. Three important barriers to purchasing environmentally-friendly packaging are identified. First, consumers need guidance in recognizing environmentally-friendly packaging; for while consumers primarily consider the packaging material itself and any eco-labels, they also consider other packaging design elements such as colours and pictures of ‘nature’ that can be misleading. Second, it became obvious that consumers lack knowledge, in particular about new packaging materials like bio-based packaging. Third, many of the studies reviewed provide evidence that other product attributes such as price and product quality are more important to consumers than environmentally-friendly packaging. Nevertheless, some studies recorded a significantly higher willingness on the part of consumers to buy and pay for environmentally-friendly packaging and products with reduced packaging compared to products with standard packaging, signalling an overall positive attitude. The literature review revealed many research gaps. For example, it became obvious that consumers’ response to environmentally-friendly food packaging is not yet well understood, in particular with regards to purchasing behaviour (in the real world as opposed to in a survey setting) and measures for overcoming existing barriers. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Consumer; Environmentally-friendly; Food; Green; Packaging; Sustainable","Food products; Packaging; Packaging machines; Sales; Conceptual frameworks; Consumer; Environmentally-friendly; Green; Market penetration; Psychological process; Scientific journals; Sustainable; Packaging materials","Review","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85078180790"

One of the possible end-of-life strategies is remanufacturing, which can provide competitive advantages through material and energy savings. Beyond industrial organization challenges, there is a question about the interest of developing a green marketing strategy for remanufactured products. Indeed, remanufactured products can be considered as green products since their industrial process has environmental benefits. Our paper asks whether consumers are willing to pay for remanufactured products, especially when they are informed that these products are 'green'. We use experimental auctions to elicit consumers' WTP for specific characteristics of remanufactured products. Our study indicates that consumers tend to value the remanufactured product less than the conventional one unless they are informed about their respective environmental impacts. We find no evidence that consumers are willing to pay a premium for the green (i.e. remanufactured) product. However, providing environmental information to consumers has an effect on their WTP for the conventional product: they generally decrease significantly their WTP for the conventional (and thus most polluting) product. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.","Consumer behaviour; Experimental auctions; Green products; Sustainable consumption; Willingness to pay","consumption behavior; environmental economics; environmental impact; experimental study; manufacturing; marketing; willingness to pay","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-80052003964"

In study 1, estimates of the prevalence of products and activities associated with an affluent lifestyle were positively related to the total amount of television respondents watched. The amount of television viewing was shown to function as a mediating variable between the demographic variables income and education and the affluence estimates. In study 2, which consisted of student participants who were either very heavy or very light soap opera viewers, heavy viewers again provided higher estimates of the prevalence of the same types of products and behaviors measured in study 1. In addition, heavy soap opera viewers constructed their estimates significantly faster than light viewers, which suggests that relevant information is more accessible in memory for heavy viewers than light viewers. The results are consistent with heuristic processing strategies, particularly the availability heuristic, in which individuals infer prevalence from the ease of retrieval of relevant examples (Tversky and Kahneman 1973).","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0031504889"

Nevertheless, there have been difficulties in developing an optimum or even a consensual model able to predict green consumer behaviour. This paper thus seeks to examine the links between a set of constructs in order to propose a model for green consumer behaviour based on a different set of buying behaviour antecedents: a prosocial attitude, the value placed on green and green communication. We developed a survey, in a self-administered questionnaire format, to gather data before applying Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) for the analysis. The results returned convey how general prosocial attitudes have a direct influence on green consumption values, and that green values positively influence green buying behaviour and receptivity to green advertising. However, green advertising generates only a weak influence on green buying behaviours. The relationship between these concepts becomes important whenever considering how best to develop green marketing campaigns and communication strategies able to further nurture green behaviours. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Buying behaviour; Green behaviour; Green communication; Prosocial","Surveys; Buying behaviour; Communication strategy; Green behaviour; Green communications; Individual behaviour; Prosocial; Self-administered questionnaire; Structural equation modelling (SEM); Consumer behavior","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85056195065"

In line with historic crises and shock events including the 2002-04 SARS outbreak, the 2011 Christchurch earthquake and 2017 Hurricane Irma, COVID-19 has significantly impacted global economic conditions, causing significant economic downturns, company and industry failures, and increased unemployment. To understand how conditions created by the pandemic to date compare to the aforementioned shock events, we conducted a thorough literature review focusing on the presentation of panic buying and herd mentality behaviours, changes to discretionary consumer spending as defined by Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs, and the impact of global media on these behaviours. The methodology utilised to analyse panic buying, herd mentality and altered patterns of consumer discretionary spending (according to Maslow’s theory) involved an analysis of consumer spending data, largely focused on Australian and American markets. Here, we analysed the volume and timing of consumer spending patterns; the volumes of spending on specific, highly-demanded consumer goods during the investigative period; and the distribution of spending on luxury and non-durable goods to identify the occurrence of these consumer behaviours. Moreover, to identify the presence of the media in influencing consumer behaviour we focused on web traffic to media sites, alongside keyword and phrase data mining. We conclude that, to date, consumer behaviour during the COVID-19 crisis appears to align with behaviours exhibited during historic shock events. We hope to contribute to the body of research on the early months of this pandemic before longer-term studies are available. © 2020 by the authors.","consumer behaviour; coronavirus; COVID-19; discretionary spending; herd mentality; media; panic buying","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85165773226"

Design/methodology/approach: The review is based on 75 papers published between 2001 and 2019 in international peer-reviewed journals or proceedings of conferences, retrieved from bibliographic databases and science search engines. Findings: Due to its importance in affecting the overall logistics costs and, as a consequence, the economic sustainability of a B2C e-commerce initiative, last-mile delivery process deserves particular attention in order to be optimised. The review highlights that, among the main factors affecting its cost, there are the probability to have failed deliveries, the customer density in the delivery areas and the degree of automation of the process. Innovative and viable last-mile delivery solutions – which may impact the mentioned drivers – include parcel lockers, crowdsourcing logistics, mapping the consumer presence at home and dynamic pricing policies. Eventually, some gaps and areas for further research activities have been identified (e.g. mapping customer behaviour, crowdsourcing logistics). Originality/value: This review offers interesting insights to both academics and practitioners. On the academic side, it analyses and classifies relevant literature about innovative and efficiency-oriented last-mile delivery solutions, proposing directions for future research efforts. On the managerial side, it presents a holistic framework of the main factors affecting last-mile delivery cost and of viable innovative solutions that may be implemented to increase efficiency. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","B2C e-commerce; Efficiency; Innovation; Last-mile delivery","","Review","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85074352267"

This work presents initial explorations into the effects of varying touch-based interfaces on consumers, and argues that research into the interfaces used to access content can be as important as research into the content itself. Two laboratory studies using a variety of touch technologies explore how touchscreen interfaces can increase perceived psychological ownership, and this in turn magnifies the endowment effect. Touch interfaces also interact with importance of product haptics and actual interface ownership in their effects on perceived product ownership, with stronger effects for products high in haptic importance and interfaces that are owned. Results highlight that perceptions of online products and marketing activities are filtered through the lens of the interfaces used to explore them, and touch-based devices like tablets can lead to higher product valuations when compared to traditional computers. © 2013 Society for Consumer Psychology.","Endowment; Haptics; Interface; Ownership; Touch; Touchscreen","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84896396965"

The objective was to explore the importance that consumers attach to sustainability attributes and investigate how this relates to the visual attention paid to these attributes during the choice decision and to willingness-to-pay (WTP). Visual attention during the decision making process was measured in terms of fixation time and fixation count, which were then analyzed in relation to the stated attribute importance.

Design/methodology/approach - Taiwan, China and the USA were the three countries selected for research into the country-of-origin, insurance and catering services. Structured questionnaires and convenience sampling were used. Samples were collected from consumers in the Taipei area. A total of 400 questionnaires were distributed with convenience sampling method, and 369 effective samples were collected, the effective rate being 92.25 percent. Stepwise regression analysis was adapted to test hypothesis. Findings - The main findings were listed as follows: the country-of-origin image, product knowledge and product involvement all have a significantly positive effect on consumer purchase decision; the country-of-origin image has a significantly positive effect on consumer purchase decisions under different product involvement; and product knowledge has significantly positive effect on consumer purchase decisions under different product involvement. Research limitations/implications - Limitations of the study are: it is unable to infer to national consumers and to other service areas and the explanatory power of some empirical models is relative low. Implications of the study are that: a more thorough structure about consumer purchase decisions should be provided and the relationship between product knowledge and information search quantity should be verified. Practical implications - Practical implications pf the study are that the company must face competitive strategies from many countries and also the effect of consumer product knowledge on business competitive strategy.

This study builds on a largescale randomized experiment of short message service (SMS) texts sent to 12,265 mobile users. We draw on contextual marketing theory to hypothesize how different combinations of mobile targeting determine consumer responses to mobile promotions. We identify that temporal targeting and geographical targeting individually increase sales purchases. Surprisingly, the sales effects of employing these two strategies simultaneously are not straightforward. When targeting proximal mobile users, our findings reveal a negative sales-lead time relationship; sending same-day mobile promotions yields an increase in the odds of consumer purchases compared with sending them two days prior to the promoted event. However, when targeting nonproximal mobile users, there is an inverted-U, curvilinear relationship. Sending one-day prior SMSs yields an increase in the odds of consumer purchases by 9.5 times compared with same-day SMSs and an increase in the odds of consumer purchases by 71% compared with two-day prior SMSs. These results are robust to unobserved heterogeneity, alternative estimation models, bootstrapped resamples, randomization checks, consumer mobile usage behavior, and segmentation of consumer scenarios. In addition, we conducted follow-up surveys to delve into the psychological mechanisms explaining the findings in our field experiment. In line with consumer construal arguments, consumers who received SMSs close (far) in time and location formed a more (less) concrete mental construal, which in turn, increased their involvement and purchase intent. These findings suggest that understanding the when, where, and how of mobile targeting strategies is crucial. Marketers can save money by carefully designing their mobile targeting campaigns.","Mobile commerce; Mobile targeting; Randomized field experiment","Commerce; Mobile commerce; Mobile telecommunication systems; Purchasing; Sales; Consumer Response; Estimation models; Field experiment; Mobile targeting; Mobile Technology; Randomized experiments; Short message services; Unobserved heterogeneity; Consumer behavior","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84904012520"

Design/methodology/approach: Several last mile scenarios are constructed for the purchase of small, non-food items, such as books, CDs, clothing, cameras and household items. Official government data, operational data from a large logistics service provider, face-to-face and telephone interviews with company managers and realistic assumptions derived from the literature form the basis of the calculations. Allowance has been made for home delivery failures, ""browsing"" trips to the shops and the return of unwanted goods. Findings: Overall, the research suggests that, while neither home delivery nor conventional shopping has an absolute CO2 advantage, on average, the home delivery operation is likely to generate less CO2 than the typical shopping trip. Nevertheless, CO2 emissions per item for intensive/infrequent shopping trips by bus could match online shopping/home delivery. Research limitations/implications: The number of items purchased per shopping trip, the choice of travel mode and the willingness to combine shopping with other activities and to group purchases into as few shopping trips or online transactions as possible are shown to be critical factors. Online retailers and home delivery companies could also apply measures (e.g. maximising drop densities and increasing the use of electric vehicles) to enhance the CO2 efficiency of their logistical operations and gain a clearer environmental advantage. Practical implications: Both consumers and suppliers need to be made more aware of the environmental implications of their respective purchasing behaviour and distribution methods so that potential CO2 savings can be made. Originality/value: The paper offers insights into the carbon footprints of conventional and online retailing from a ""last mile"" perspective. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Air pollution; Carbon; Delivery services; Distribution channels and markets; Internet shopping","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-77949322043"

For example, Amazon.com does not just sell books; it also enhances that core product with automated product recommendations, ""wish list"" tracking, order status updates, customer reviews, and many other valuable supporting services. These supporting services are made possible exclusively through the design and deployment of information technology (IT) to provide website supporting services functionality (SSF). In this paper, we define and develop the concept of B2C SSF and investigate how IT can support core products or services. We theorize the role that SSF plays in an environment where individuals who visit B2C websites are not only customers but also technology users. Given the unique online environment that amalgamates vendor services with information systems (IS), our model integrates theories from both services marketing and technology acceptance to help explain the behavior of these customers/users. In doing so, we investigate the role of the extensively researched concept of service quality in relation to SSF. Although service quality provides guidance for how supporting services should be provided (e.g., responsively and reliably), it does not address what those services are (e.g., product recommendations). SSF addresses this deficiency thus providing both theoretical and practical benefits through a focus on IT design and deployment. The results of a field study support that SSF is an important predictor of customer beliefs and behavior, beyond that predicted by service quality alone. SSF is an important concept to consider-theoretically and practically-in IT-mediated B2C service. © 2008 INFORMS.","E-business; Online customer service; Service quality; Supporting services; Supporting services functionality","Electronic commerce; Quality of service; Reviews; Sales; Websites; eBusiness; Online customers; Service Quality; Supporting services; Supporting services functionality; Online systems","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-61349127769"

Design/methodology/approach - A questionnaire with four-point Likert scale is applied to 324 usable responses. Ten attributes are tested, namely convenience of usage, accessibility, features availability, bank management and image, security, privacy, design, content, speed, and fees and charges. Findings - Results indicate that all elements for ten identified factors are significant with respect to the users' adoption of e-banking services. Privacy and security are the major sources of dissatisfaction, which have momentously impacted users' satisfaction. Meanwhile, accessibility, convenience, design and content are sources of satisfaction. Besides, the speed, product features availability, and reasonable service fees and charges, as well as the bank's operations management factor are critical to the success of the e-banks. WAP, GPRS and 3G features from mobile devices are of no significance or influence in the adoption of e-banking services in this study. Results also reveal that privacy, security and convenience factors play an important role in determining the users' acceptance of e-banking services with respect to different segmentation of age group, education level and income level. Research limitations/implications - The use of convenience sampling in this study weakens research objectivity. This study excludes the voice of non-users and non-users' views should be taken into account in future study. Practical implications - The results are expected to provide a practical contribution in the area of retail banking and in understanding consumer behavior in the Malaysian business-to-business financial services industry. Originality/value - This paper is the extension of an earlier study by Suganthi et al. which identified seven factors affecting the adoption of internet banking, with 17 elements.

However, the current market penetration of EV is still at the nascent stage despite many governments employing dynamic advertising policies. This paper empirically investigates the factors influencing a consumer's intention to adopt an EV. A total of 211 peer-reviewed research articles published between 2009 and 2019 covering the main categories consumer intentions – adoption intention, purchase intention, behavioural intention, and usage intention, – were selected. This study categorises influential factors, into four main types, namely demographic, situational, contextual, and psychological. A comprehensive overview of the theoretical perspectives was also developed to understand adoption behaviour and a consumer's intentions towards EVs. The findings provide the most common research methodology employed for testing, analysing and comparing the relations among EV factors. A simple meta-analysis shows that the trend of studies on the influencing factors for adopting EVs has increased significantly over the past decade. Finally, this review study has managerial implications and shows future directions for EV researchers and practitioners that may help governments and the automobile industry to increase the usage share of EVs. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollution; Electric vehicle adoption; Meta-analysis; Road transport; Zero emission vehicle","Automotive industry; Electric automobiles; Adoption intention; Behavioural intentions; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Environmental pollutions; Influential factors; Managerial implications; Market penetration; Research methodologies; consumption behavior; electric vehicle; empirical analysis; meta-analysis; technology adoption; theoretical study; Factor analysis","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089414297"

This article addresses this gap with a conceptual framework incorporating several individual and situational factors with a focus on three relevant consumer traits - consumer impulsiveness (CI), optimum stimulation level (OSL), and self-monitoring (SM). Findings from a survey with retail shoppers about their actual purchase decisions show that both CI and OSL have a positive association with the level of impulse buying and variety seeking. However, CI is more strongly associated with impulse buying and OSL with variety seeking. Moreover, SM relates negatively with impulse buying and positively with variety seeking; it also moderates the influence of CI and OSL on both the behaviors in opposite directions.

The model, tested by data collected across the regions of Asia Pacific, Western Europe and North America, illustrates that personal orientation in the international market may significantly impact on repurchase behaviour elicited for luxuries.

A panel of 12 experienced general practitioners rated 103 consultations with hypertensive patients on the quality of psychosocial care. There was a wide consensus between the judges, resulting in a high reliability score. Two contrasting groups were formed: consultations that were rated high and those rated low in quality of psychosocial care. A comparison was made between this general assessment of the quality of psychosocial care and a more detailed assessment of the same consultations on nine much used communication variables made by trained psychologists. Knowledge about doctor-patient communication proved to predict very well as to which quality group the consultations belonged. A very high percentage (95%) was predicted accurately, solely on the basis of these nine communication variables. Affective behaviour, and especially nonverbal affective behaviour had the strongest predictive power. In the last part of the study a third source of assessment, i.e. patients' satisfaction was compared with both other sources. Much lower relationships were found, although most were in the predicted direction. Affective behavior seems to be the most important in determining patient's satisfaction.

Results from over 400 consumers enable us to ascertain not only the importance of each switching barrier but also to develop a more parsimonious understanding of these barriers, through factor analysis. The results reveal similar patterns in the two industries in respect to switching barriers. The first of the four factors contains reasons related to apathy, the second factor contains negative reasons for customers staying with their current service provider, the third factor relates to relationship variables and the final factor relates to service recovery.

The cueing of commonly performed ecological behaviors as environmentally friendly (what we call positive cueing) renders both cued and non-cued common ecological behaviors more diagnostic for the inference of pro-environmental attitudes (Study 1). As a result, positive cueing increases the likelihood that people will see themselves as consumers who are concerned with the degree to which their behavior is environmentally responsible (Study 2). The cueing of common ecological behaviors leads participants to choose environmentally friendly products with greater frequency, and even to use scrap paper more efficiently (Study 3).

Specifically, we developed and tested a model linking a related construct, environmental locus of control (ELOC), to a series of pro-environmental behaviors. Design/methodology/approach - The context related to various personal and household behaviors vis-à-vis the environment, and the subject pool consisted of a diverse group of urban consumers. A survey was employed to measure various attitudinal and personality variables corresponding to internal/external locus of control, as well as a battery of pro-environmental behaviors. The research propositions were tested using a structural equation modeling approach. Findings - We found four distinct dimensions of ELOC, two of which relate to an external LOC (""biospheric-altruism"" and ""corporate skepticism"") and the other two relate to an internal LOC (""economic motivation"" and ""individual recycling efforts""). We then linked these four dimensions to a variety of pro-environmental behaviors. Highly variable patterns were obtained, with different dimensions assuming a greater or lesser impact, or no role at all, depending on the specific behavior under analysis. Research limitations/implications - Generalizability of the findings is limited due to the sample (urban consumers from one major city), and the method employed (validity of self-report measures and the non-experimental nature of the field study). Practical implications - Our findings highlight the importance of considering the specificity of pro-environmental behaviors, when assessing the antecedent roles of pro-environmental attitudes/dispositions, which are in-and-of-themselves, complex and multidimensional. Originality/value - In this era of environmental degradation, researchers, managers, and public policy makers alike need to consider that pro-environmental attitudes are composed of multiple dispositional facets, and that the role of these facets is highly context-specific. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Consumer behaviour; Green marketing; Social responsibility","","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-22544478143"

Through taking a social constructionism position this research focused on what people think and feel at an individual and collective level on the role of social media to create panic behaviour. Data have been collected from thirty-four consumers who have minimum one active social media account. These participants are contacted through telephonic interview due to maintaining the social distancing. Findings reveal that uncertainties and insecurities proof, buying as persuasion, product unavailability proof, authorities' communication, global logic, and expert opinion are some of the causes on social media platforms that developed the situation of consumer panic buying during Covid-19 crises. Furthermore, the unprecedented level of real-time information on Covid-19 at users' fingertips can give them the tools they need to make smart decisions, but also make them more anxious about what is to come; experts say that may lead to panic buying or stockpiling of products. The study has tried to develop understanding about how social media generates social proof and offers a window into people's collective response to the coronavirus outbreak and shapes panic buying reaction. The study has provided a consumer panic buying theory based on the results of this study and on existing theories, such as global capitalism/information society risk society, social influence, and social proof. These theories help to understand how global logic is built due to the use of social media and how different social proofs are generated which developed the behaviour of consumer panic buying due to Covid-19 pandemic. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Consumer panic buying theory; Social constructionism; Social influence; Social media","Coronavirus; Dudleya edulis; collective action; consumption behavior; COVID-19; disease spread; media role; social media","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089830452"

Therefore, online retailers face new challenges for supporting consumers consisting of the introduction of advanced technologies such as augmented reality systems. The present study investigates the effect of augmented reality technologies on consumer behaviour within the online retail environments, by comparing two different cultural settings. Drawing upon the technology acceptance model (TAM), new constructs related to the technology characteristics (e.g. quality of information, aesthetic quality, interactivity, and response time) developed a new conceptual model. This model has been tested for a new technology for virtual try-on (a smart mirror for virtual glasses). Focusing on young consumers, data collected in Italy and Germany yielding a total of 318 participants was used. Findings across these two markets reflect cross-market similarities, but also dissimilarities, related to consumers’ motivation to employ augmented reality systems for supporting their online purchase decision. These insights should prove helpful to retailers in better manage the online channels, that could be easily extended to the mobile one. © 2017","Aesthetic quality; Augmented reality; Consumer behaviour; Decision-making; E-tailing; Interactivity; Technology acceptance model (TAM)","consumption behavior; decision making; esthetics; Internet; marketing; modeling; retailing; young population","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85019657064"

Design/methodology/approach - The conceptual framework consists of the following constructs: actual self-congruence, ideal self-congruence, desires congruence, service quality, consumers' overall attitude to a service firm, and intention to return. Moreover, 12 hypotheses were developed and tested. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis were used to test the validity of the measures, while PLS was used in hypotheses testing. Data were collected from 185 consumers who had recently visited a restaurant or hotel. Findings - Strong support was found for 11 of the 12 hypotheses. Findings reveal that ideal self-congruence and desires congruence have positive effects on consumer satisfaction. In contrast, it is shown that actual self-congruence is not related to consumer satisfaction. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the two dimensions of service quality - physical quality and staff behaviour - have a positive impact on both desires congruence and consumer satisfaction. Importantly, consumer satisfaction is found to be a better indicator of the consumers' overall attitude to the service firm than service quality. The study confirms that consumer satisfaction mediates the relationship between the two service quality dimensions, ideal self-congruence, and intention to return. Originality/value - This study makes four important contributions. First, satisfaction research is advanced by integrating self-concept theory into the postpurchase evaluation of services. Second, the relationship between the multidimensional nature of service quality and consumer satisfaction is examined by testing paths from two posited dimensions of service quality - physical quality and staff behaviour - to satisfaction. Third, the consumers' overall attitude to a service firm is integrated into existing models of satisfaction and its impact on behavioural loyalty (intention to return) is tested. Finally, a contribution is made to the satisfaction research literature by testing the effect of service quality on desires congruence, and the effect of desires congruence on consumer satisfaction. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Customer satisfaction; Hospitality services; Service levels; United Kingdom","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-38949106572"

The results of an empirical evaluation using real-world online reviews reveal that incorporating nonverbal features of reviewers can significantly improve the performance of online fake review detection models. Moreover, compared with verbal features, nonverbal features of reviewers are shown to be more important for fake review detection. Furthermore, model pruning based on a sensitivity analysis improves the parsimony of the developed fake review detection model without sacrificing its performance.

That responsible behaviour forces businesses not only to understand their responsible purchase intention, but also helps them to sustainability in the market for the long term. In this regard, very little discussion is available in current literature, especially in the context of apparel product consumption. Therefore, to contribute to literature in this field, this work aims to build a predictive sustainable model through an empirical study to examine the relationships among different factors such as attitude, social norms, perceived behaviour control, environmental consciousness, willingness to pay (WTP) premium and consumer purchase intention for environmentally friendly apparels. The data of two hundred and thirty-two respondents were analysed by structural equation modelling (SEM). With the help of the findings, it can be concluded that Indian consumers are aware of green apparels, have a positive attitude to them and show a responsible purchase intention to protect the environment. This is in contrast to the old saying that Indians are price sensitive given the emergence of higher WTP premiums for green apparel products. Other factors such as subjective norms, perceived behaviour control and environmental consciousness are also positively affecting consumer purchase intention. From the study findings, retail managers can benefit through more focused strategies for environmental protection to make a reduction in apparel material while educating their consumers about green apparel. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Consciousness and willingness to pay; Eco-friendly apparels; Eco-responsible purchase intention; Predictive; Sustainable development","India; clothing industry; consumption behavior; empirical analysis; environmental economics; prediction; retailing; sustainable development; willingness to pay","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85091212499"

Plant-based meat substitutes have been identified as healthy sources of protein that, in comparison to meat, offer a number of social, environmental and health benefits and may play a role in reducing meat consumption. However, there has been a lack of research on the role they can play in the policy agenda and how specific meat substitute attributes can influence consumers to replace partially replace meat in their diets. In this paper, we examine consumers’ preferences for attributes of meat and meat substitute products and develop consumer segments based on these preferences. The results of a choice experiment with 247 UK consumers, using food labels and mince (ground meat), illustrate that the type of mince, fat content, country of origin and price are major factors that influence choice. Carbon footprint, method of production and brand play a secondary role in determining consumers’ choices of meat/meat substitutes. Latent class analysis is used to identify six consumer segments: price conscious, healthy eaters, taste driven, green, organic and vegetarian consumers which have different socio-demographic characteristics and meat consumption patterns. Future interventions and policies aimed at reducing meat consumption including labelling, provision of more information, financial incentives, educational campaigns and new product development will be more effective if they are holistic and target specific consumer segments, instead of focus on the average consumer. © 2016","Choice experiment; Latent class; Market segmentation; Meat reduction; Meat substitutes","United Kingdom; consumption behavior; food consumption; food market; food policy; meat; segmentation","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85006713650"

Explicit linkages are specified between situational and individual characteristics. Perceived-risk evaluation is identified as conceptually distinct from assessment of perceived risk, and the construct of risk-taking propensity is separated from those of risk affinity and perceived risk. The framework further presents points of intersection between the literatures on perceived risk and the literatures on consumer decision-making, information search, and satisfaction. Finally, it serves as an anchor for framing future research to promote conceptual and methodological consistency, and to guide progress in directions that are consistent with some leading edge paradigms outside of marketing.","Consumer behavior; Inherent risk; Perceived risk; Risk affinity; Risk assessment; Risk attention; Risk evaluation; Risk framing; Risk processing; Risk-taking propensity","","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-4744369268"

Design/methodology/approach - An online survey of a virtual community of Apple computer users was conducted to test a model of involvement, participation, loyalty, trust, and attitudes toward the brand exist in messages within the community. Findings - The causes and effects of lurking and posting differed. Lurking contributed to brand loyalty more than posting did, and the primary purpose of lurking was to look for information regarding product function/performance, instead of satisfying consumers' affective needs. Research limitations/implications - As a result of the limitations in a computer mediated communication environment, virtual consumer communities should be perceived as an arena for weak-tied strangers to communicate for word-of-mouth (WOM) behavior, rather than as a brand community. Practical implications - Although negative messages in a community can hurt brand image, companies should encourage the establishment of communities about their products and encourage consumers to participate in them. Originality/value - Although the importance of virtual communities has been recognized, few studies have been done to examine the business value of consumer communities. Based on perspectives of brand community and WOM behavior, this paper contributes to virtual community and marketing research by clarifying the effects of consumers' lurking and posting behaviors in a consumer community on brand loyalty. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Brand loyalty; Buying behaviour; Internet","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-33747454618"

When adopting a sustainable food lifestyle, consumers are confronted with complex choices. Today's food consumption is too complex to be explained by socio-demographic factors exclusively. A broader perspective is needed. In order to explain behaviour across different consumer segments better, relatively homogenous segments of food consumers were identified by segmenting food consumers based on a wide range of variables. The current study aims to provide an overview of published studies that have segmented consumers with regard to sustainable food consumption. The literature review has been conducted by searching SciVerse Scopus for all relevant articles available until November 2010. The main criterion for including a specific study was the inclusion of empirical analyses of primary data, resulting in consumer segments with regard to sustainable food consumption. Sixteen articles were incorporated in the final analysis. First, the variables used for segmentation and profiling in the included articles have been categorized into three levels of abstraction: personality characteristics, food-related lifestyles and behaviour. The three levels of abstraction proved to be helpful in categorizing the segmentation studies. The findings indicate that variables on all three levels were efficient in differentiating consumer segments regarding sustainability. In addition, the importance of price and health differed across the segments, although these variables are only indirectly related to sustainability. Second, the three most frequently identified consumer segments with regard to sustainable food consumption were: 'greens', 'potential greens' and 'non-greens'. These segments differed from one another on all three levels of abstraction. This implies that future segmentation studies should include variables on all levels of abstraction to get a complete picture of existing sustainable consumer segments. Marketers should be aware that targeting specific segments based on socio-demographic variables exclusively is not sufficient. Personality characteristics, lifestyle and behaviour are all important to take into consideration. Attempts at stimulating sustainable consumption might be most effective when differences across consumer segments are taken into account. Future research is needed to explore the characteristics of different sustainable food consumer segments with respect to their potential contributions in promoting sustainable development. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Behaviour; Consumer segments; Food; Lifestyles; Personality characteristics; Sustainability","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84867374958"

With this conceptual framework and research agenda, we challenge consumer researchers to ask deeper questions about why religious affiliation and level of religiosity may be driving previously established differences in consumer behavior, and to uncover the psychological mechanisms underlying the effects.

The data are derived from face to face interviews with 300 patients: 60 from each of the five modes of treatment. The findings demonstrate that this model can explain the use of alternative as well as orthodox medical services. Patients choose specific kinds of practitioners for particular problems, and some use a mixture of practitioners to treat a specific complaint. The choice of type of practitioner(s) is multidimensional and cannot solely be explained either by disenchantment with medicine or by an 'alternative ideology'.","Alternative therapies; Consumer choice; Health care","Adult; Aged; Canada; Choice Behavior; Complementary Therapies; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Male; Mental Healing; Middle Aged; Motivation; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Patient Participation; Patient Satisfaction; Sick Role; Urban Population; adult; alternative medicine; article; canada; consumer; decision making; female; general practitioner; health care; human; interview; major clinical study; male; manipulative medicine; medical research; motivation; traditional medicine","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0031000219"

First, the shopping cart completely modifies consumers' calculations. It does so by leading them to accomplish particular gestures, by transforming a budgetary constraint into a volumetric one, and by providing them with true calculative tools. Second, shopping with a cart also implies some ‘planned’ cognitive processes. These processes concern interplay between family needs, selection equipment (such as a shopping list) and market information (packaging, for example). The combination of these elements moves the consumer from mere calculation (price-based computing) to ‘qualculation’ (i.e. quality-based rational judgements). Third, and in particular, since it favours the transformation of the individual consumer into a collective one (or ‘cluster’, i.e. a small group of people gathering around the same device), a shopping cart functions as a scene or as a frame for collective ‘calqulation’ (from the French verb ‘calquer’, i.e. adjusting one's standpoint to that of another, and vice versa). © 2008, Sage Publications.

Multilevel meta-analyses was applied to the studies in review, in order to find the major reason(s) for the purchase of organic grocery, milk, fruits and vegetables.

This research aims to investigate how different factors may enhance or impede young consumers’ intentions to purchase a specific type of eco-friendly product, i.e. organic food. Data were obtained from 289 respondents in an emerging market economy, i.e. Vietnam. Multivariate data analysis using structural equation modelling revealed that food safety concern, health consciousness and media exposure to food messages played integral roles in the formation of attitude towards organic food. Interestingly, consumers’ environmental concern and food taste were of little value in predicting their attitude. Notably, perceived barriers (i.e. high price, inadequate availability, poor labelling and extra time required) significantly impeded both attitude and purchase intention towards organic food. The insights gained from this research extend current knowledge about pro-environmental behaviour in developing countries and they have important practical implications for marketers and other key stakeholders. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","eco-friendly products; emerging market economy; Green marketing; organic food; Vietnam; young consumer","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85044085427"

This paper compares competing theories of consumer empowerment and details findings that examine the applicability of the theory to ""ethical consumer"" narratives. The nature and impact of consumer empowerment in consumer decision making is then discussed. Design/methodology/approach - The study takes an exploratory approach by conducting semi-structured in-depth interviews with a purposive sample of ten consumers. These were recruited from an ""ethical product"" fair in Scotland. Findings - Results indicate that the participating consumers embraced a voting metaphor, either explicitly or implicitly, to view consumption as an ethical/political domain. Setting their choices within perceived collective consumer behaviour, they characterised their consumption as empowering. This results in an ethical consumer project that can be seen as operating within the market. It, therefore, suggests some tensions between consumer power and sustainable living. Research limitations/implications - This small-scale study relates to a single country and location. A particular group of accentuated consumers was recruited. Studies of the narratives of other consumer groupings would clearly be valuable. Practical implications - To the extent that political democracy is perceived as failing, it appears that the profile of the market as a site of consumer engagement is raised. Marketers would be wise, therefore, to take increasingly account of ""empowered"" consumers. Originality/value - Little attention has been paid to the theory of consumption as voting. However, a continuing rise in the consideration of ethics among consumers and producers suggests its rehabilitation and further exploration would be worthwhile. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Consumer behaviour; Consumption; Ethics","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-33748955582"

We theorize that creativity engagement and success depend on the cultural tightness—the extent to which a country is characterized by strong social norms and low tolerance for deviant behaviors—of both an innovator’s country and the audience’s country, as well as the cultural distance between these two countries. Using field data from a global online crowdsourcing platform that organizes creative contests for consumer-product brands, supplemented by interviews with marketing experts, we found that individuals from tight cultures are less likely than counterparts from loose cultures to engage in and succeed at foreign creative tasks; this effect is intensified as the cultural distance between the innovator’s and the audience’s country increases. Additionally, tight cultures are less receptive to foreign creative ideas. But we also found that in certain circumstances—when members of a tight culture do creative work in their own or culturally close countries—cultural tightness can actually promote creativity success. This finding implies that some degree of convergent thinking as engendered by tight cultures could be beneficial for creativity, challenging the dominant view in creativity research that divergent thinking is a prerequisite for creative performance. © The Author(s) 2014","creativity; crowdsourcing; cultural distance; cultural tightness; globalization; social norms","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84930440875"

Here, we consider the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with production of food that is lost at the retail and consumer level, as well as the potential effects on GHG emissions of a shift to dietary recommendations. Calculations are based on the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) food availability data set and literature meta-analysis of emission factors for various food types. Food losses contribute 1.4 kilograms (kg) carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2-eq) capita-1day-1 (28%) to the overall carbon footprint of the average U.S. diet; in total, this is equivalent to the emissions of 33 million average passenger vehicles annually. Whereas beef accounts for only 4% of the retail food supply by weight, it represents 36% of the diet-related GHG emissions. An iso-caloric shift from the current average U.S. diet to USDA dietary recommendations could result in a 12% increase in diet-related GHG emissions, whereas a shift that includes a decrease in caloric intake, based on the needs of the population (assuming moderate activity), results in a small (1%) decrease in diet-related GHG emissions. These findings emphasize the need to consider environmental costs of food production in formulating recommended food patterns. © 2014 by Yale University.","Dietary recommendations; Environmental impact; Food waste; Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions; Industrial ecology; Life cycle assessment (LCA)","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Carbon footprint; Environmental impact; Food supply; Gas emissions; Industrial emissions; Life cycle; Nutrition; Dietary recommendations; Environmental costs; Food waste; Industrial ecology; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Passenger vehicles; Potential effects; U.s. department of agricultures; carbon dioxide; carbon footprint; consumption behavior; data set; dietary shift; environmental impact; federal system; food availability; food intake; greenhouse gas; industrial ecology; life cycle analysis; Greenhouse gases","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84931569834"

Marketing researchers have found that heavy users of consumer products account for a large percentage of sales. Tourism researchers report mixed results when using travel expenditures as a segmentation variable. Earlier studies were unable to distinguish heavy users from light users in terms of demographic and socioeconomic characteristics but more recent studies reported very different results. Based on these results, it seems that segmenting visitors based on travel expenditures may be a useful alternative to the more common approach of segmenting on the basis of travel activities. These studies were conducted in the United States and the consumers under study were Americans. There are relatively few reports in the tourism literature about Asian tourists' spending behavior. In view of the extravagant spending behavior and unique spending patterns of Taiwanese tourists, this paper applied and assessed the potential usefulness of an expenditure-based segmentation technique in marketing Guam to the Taiwanese travelers. Results from this study show that heavy spenders were distinguishable from the other segments in terms of age, party size, length of stay, trip purpose, travel mode, and their spending pattern.

Using a detailed survey of 1721 Dutch households, we measure the extent to which consumers are aware of their energy consumption and whether they have taken measures to reduce their energy costs. Our results show that ""energy literacy"" and awareness among respondents is low: just 56% of the respondents are aware of their monthly charges for energy consumption, and 40% do not appropriately evaluate investment decisions in energy efficient equipment. We document that demographics and consumer attitudes towards energy conservation, but not energy literacy and awareness, have direct effects on behavior regarding heating and cooling of the home.

This research investigates whether specific affective states influence food consumption and whether this influence is moderated by factors such as information and the nature of the product (hedonic versus less hedonic). The authors show that an integrative mood management and mood evaluation framework accounts for this relationship more effectively than a self-regulation explanation. A preliminary test and two lab studies show that people eat larger amounts of hedonic foods (buttered popcorn and M&M's) when they are in a sad state than when they are in a happy state and that this effect is attenuated when nutritional information is present. In contrast, they tend to eat larger amounts of a less hedonic product (raisins) when they are in a happy state than when they are in a sad state.

Previous research has found that reductions (up to 54%) in the number of low-selling SKUs need not affect perceptions of variety and therefore sales, significantly. In this research, the authors analyze data from a natural experiment conducted by an online grocer, in which 94% of the categories experienced dramatic cuts in the number of SKUs offered, particularly low-selling SKUs. Sales were indeed affected dramatically, increasing an average of 11% across the 42 categories examined. Sales rose in more than two-thirds of these categories, nearly half of which experienced an increase of 10% or more; 75% of households increased their overall expenditures after the cut in SKUs. In turn, the authors examine how different types of SKU reductions - defined by how the cuts affect the available attributes or features of a category (e.g., the number of brands) - affected purchase behavior differently. The results indicate that consumers experienced divergent reactions to the reduction in sizes, but they uniformly welcomed the elimination of clutter brought on by the reduction in redundant items. In addition, of households that were loyal to a single brand, size, or brand-size combination that was eliminated, nearly half continued purchasing within the category. Also, contrary to previous research on SKU reductions, the authors find that category sales depend on the total number of SKUs offered. The authors extend the previous research by showing that (1) category sales depend on the availability of key product and category attributes and (2) two particularly important attributes to consumers in an assortment are brand and flavor.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0035630269"

We review the comparative advantages of store shopping and e-shopping, and conclude that neither type uniformly dominates the other. We identify the building blocks of the shopping process, and note that information and communications technologies are making possible the spatial and temporal fragmentation and recombination of those elements. We analyze future shopping-related changes in transportation as the net outcome of four different fundamental causes, that can be viewed hierarchically: (1) changes in shopping mode share (i.e. shifts in the proportion of shopping activities conducted through store shopping, e-shopping and other modes), keeping the volume of goods purchased and per capita consumption spending constant; (2) changes in the volume of goods purchased, keeping per capita consumption spending constant; (3) changes in per capita consumption spending, independent of demographic changes; and (4) demographic changes. Some factors result in reduced travel while others lead to increased travel. The combined outcome of all factors does not appear to support any hope that e-shopping will reduce travel on net; to the contrary there may be negative impacts due to increased travel, even if those impacts are likely to be localized and/or small in magnitude for the most part. Thus, on the whole, we are likely (with some exceptions) to see continued adoption of both store shopping and e-shopping. Consumers will blend both forms as they conduct a sequence of shopping activities, and retailers will blend both in marketing to and serving customers. Assessing the transportation impacts of e-shopping - even in the short term, let alone the long term - presents some formidable measurement challenges. Nevertheless, those challenges are worthy of our most creative efforts at solution. © 2004 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","Business-to-consumer e-commerce; E-commerce; Shopping behavior; Teleshopping; Transportation impacts of ICT","Information technology; Marketing; Telecommunication systems; Transportation; comparative advantage; consumption behavior; e-commerce; retailing; shopping activity; E-shopping; Store shopping; Electronic commerce","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-2542424872"

The relations among these aspects of the videos were assessed as well. We found that most of these videos were news clips or consumer-generated content. The majority of the videos were negative in tone, disapproving of the HPV vaccine. In addition, negative videos were liked more by the viewers than positive or ambiguous ones.

Status seeking is an established driver, but other managerially relevant drivers can also explain conspicuous consumption of luxuries. The study develops and empirically confirms a conceptual model that shows that bandwagon and snobbish buying patterns underlie the more generic conspicuous consumption of luxuries. In addition to status seeking, the self-concept orientation regulates which of these two patterns is more prominent. Both susceptibility to normative influence and need for uniqueness mediate the influence of self-concept. The modeled psychological constructs explain a large part of the variance in conspicuous luxury consumption patterns and can be used as input in the development of marketing strategies. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Bandwagon and snob effects; Conspicuous consumption; Luxury; Self-concept; Status","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84904109562"

Within recent international policy framings, sustainable consumption is part of an efficiency-focused rationalisation discourse, representing distinct theories of the environment, the state and the individual. This article considers how this discourse resonates and impacts upon the very citizens it has been constructed to affect. 'Alternate' discourses of sustainable consumption and critical social science research suggests that politically dominant approaches mean little to members of the public. This suggestion is tested here through interviews with participants of a sustainable lifestyle programme in the UK called Action at Home. This analysis argues that social justice, not sustainable lifestyles, has the most resonance with interviewees. As a result, not only do calls for rationalisation carry little cultural meaning, they also actively alienate individuals from the project of sustainable consumption. This is because the idea of rationalising lifestyles appears to actively ignore, and is unable to address, individual's pressing social concerns. Hence, the rationalisation of lifestyles makes little (common) sense.","","United Kingdom; consumer-resource interaction; consumption behavior; household expenditure; lifestyle; rationalization; sustainability","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0036623316"

Building on previous work on commitment, self-signaling, and the principle of consistency, a large, intensive field experiment (N p 2,416) examined the effect of hotel guests' commitment to practice environmentally friendly behavior during their stay. Notably, commitment was symbolic-guests were unaware of the experiment and of the fact that their behavior would be monitored, which allowed them to exist in anonymity and behave as they wish. When guests made a brief but specific commitment at check-in, and received a lapel pin to symbolize their commitment, they were over 25% more likely to hang at least one towel for reuse, and this increased the total number of towels hung by over 40%.

In this conceptual paper we demonstrate the rise of inconspicuous consumption via a wide-ranging synthesis of the literature. We attribute this rise to the signalling ability of traditional luxury goods being diluted, a preference for not standing out as ostentatious during times of economic hardship, and an increased desire for sophistication and subtlety in design in order to further distinguish oneself for a narrow group of peers. We decouple the constructs of luxury and conspicuousness, which allows us to reconceptualise the signalling quality of brands and the construct of luxury. This also has implications for understanding consumer behaviour practices such as counterfeiting and suggests that consumption trends in emerging markets may take a different path from the past. © 2014, © 2014 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","branding; conspicuous consumption; inconspicuous consumption; luxury","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84926420605"

Design/methodology/approach: Articles on tourism and hotel demand modeling and forecasting published mostly in both science citation index and social sciences citation index journals were identified and analyzed. Findings: This review finds that the studies focused on hotel demand are relatively less than those on tourism demand. It is also observed that more and more studies have moved away from the aggregate tourism demand analysis, whereas disaggregate markets and niche products have attracted increasing attention. Some studies have gone beyond neoclassical economic theory to seek additional explanations of the dynamics of tourism and hotel demand, such as environmental factors, tourist online behavior and consumer confidence indicators, among others. More sophisticated techniques such as nonlinear smooth transition regression, mixed-frequency modeling technique and nonparametric singular spectrum analysis have also been introduced to this research area. Research limitations/implications: The main limitation of this review is that the articles included in this study only cover the English literature. Future review of this kind should also include articles published in other languages. The review provides a useful guide for researchers who are interested in future research on tourism and hotel demand modeling and forecasting. Practical implications: This review provides important suggestions and recommendations for improving the efficiency of tourism and hospitality management practices. Originality/value: The value of this review is that it identifies the current trends in tourism and hotel demand modeling and forecasting research and points out future research directions. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Methodological development; Modelling and forecasting; Tourism and hotel demand","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85010064622"

It also proposes a definition for marketing strategy, the focal organizational strategy construct of the field, and enumerates a number of foundational premises of marketing strategy. The domain of strategic marketing is viewed as encompassing the study of organizational, inter-organizational and environmental phenomena concerned with (1) the behavior of organizations in the marketplace in their interactions with consumers, customers, competitors and other external constituencies, in the context of creation, communication and delivery of products that offer value to customers in exchanges with organizations, and (2) the general management responsibilities associated with the boundary spanning role of the marketing function in organizations. At the broadest level, marketing strategy can be defined as an organization's integrated pattern of decisions that specify its crucial choices concerning products, markets, marketing activities and marketing resources in the creation, communication and/or delivery of products that offer value to customers in exchanges with the organization and thereby enables the organization to achieve specific objectives. Chief among the issues that are fundamental to strategic marketing as a field of study are the questions of how the marketing strategy of a business is influenced by demand side factors and supply side factors. © Academy of Marketing Science 2009.","Competitive marketing strategy; Market strategy; Marketing strategy; Strategic marketing","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-78650967444"

To that end, marketers need to develop personalized messages to enhance click-through rates and online purchases. This study explores online advertising strategies for an emerging lodging concept—Airbnb. Airbnb distinguishes itself from traditional hotels by offering guests a “feeling at home” (e.g., belongingness) and an “atypical place to stay” (e.g., uniqueness). In this research, we examine the interaction effect of advertising appeal (belongingness vs. uniqueness) and an individual's sense of power (low vs. high) on click-through intention and purchase intention. The findings suggest that powerless individuals respond more favorably to the belongingness appeal, whereas powerful individuals react more positively to the uniqueness appeal. Furthermore, results from a mediation analysis reveal that self-brand connection is the underlying mechanism that explains these effects.

The survey was conducted with the help of a public utility company, and questionnaires were sent to three groups with different debt histories over the preceding two years: Non-Debtors (no debt to the company), Mild Debtors (late payment to the company), and Serious Debtors (sued for debt recovery by the company). Economic and demographic factors predicted debt category well, supporting previous results. Further variance between groups was accounted for by people's money management skills and facilities, by measures of their time horizons, and by aspects of their consumer behaviour. Non-debtors had more money management facilities (e.g. bank accounts) than debtors, and rated their abilities at money management more highly. Debtors had shorter time horizons than non-debtors. Debtors were more likely to buy cigarettes and Christmas presents for children than non-debtors. No group differences were found for attitudes to debt or locus of control. There were significant group differences for measures of economic socialization, social comparisons, use of credit, and other aspects of consumer behaviour, but these differences were not independently significant on multivariate analysis. Conclusions must be qualified because of low return rates, but the results suggest that a complex of psychological and behavioural variables affect debt and are affected by it.

A total of 302 female online consumers in South Korea participated in a survey. After shopping cosmetic products with the AR function in a mobile app, participants completed the questionnaire. The findings reveal that the controllability and playfulness dimensions of perceived interactivity influence mental imagery, which, in turn, affects consumers' attitudes toward a product and their behavioral intentions.

Cognitive (sensory) innovativeness is the preference for engaging in new experiences with the objective of stimulating the mind (senses). The article presents psychometrically valid measures of these constructs and discusses two studies that examine the differences between cognitive and sensory innovativeness. One study, based on 326 undergraduate students, shows that the innovativeness constructs differ in their relationship with other personality traits, such as preference for verbal/visual style of processing. The other study, based on the personal computer, food processor, and video cassette recorder purchase behavior of 245 respondents, shows that cognitive and sensory innovators differ in their responses to innovations and demographic profiles.

Academic research initially explored customer engagement (CE) and customer engagement behavior within the firm-customer dyad. Recent developments suggest a need to broaden the conceptual domain of CE not only from the focal subject of customers/consumers to a general actor-to-actor perspective but also from the firm-customer dyad to relationships among multiple actors in service ecosystems. Hence, the purpose of this article is to bring a broadened definition to the conceptual domain of actor engagement (AE) in networks. Our theorizing process adopted a propositional conceptual approach that built on CE research and was guided by the general theoretical perspective of service-dominant logic. The critical contribution of the article lies in its systematic development of the conceptual domain of AE and the potential this development has for guiding knowledge development and cross-fertilization in various research fields, including customer, work, citizen, and business engagement. We provide a definition of AE and five fundamental propositions that embody a broader network perspective of engagement and conclude by discussing an agenda for future research that illustrates its managerial relevance. © The Author(s) 2019.","actor engagement; connectedness; customer engagement; networks; service ecosystems","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85061590263"

A distinctive and insufficiently explored legal response to bounded rationality is to attempt to debias through law by steering people in more rational directions. In many domains, existing legal analyses emphasize the alternative approach of insulating outcomes from the effects of boundedly rational behavior, which itself is taken as a given. In fact, however, many legal strategies are efforts to engage in the different approach of debiasing through law by reducing or even eliminating people's boundedly rational behavior. This paper offers a general account of how debiasing through law does or could work to address legal questions across a range of areas, from consumer safety law to corporate law to property law. Discussion is also devoted to the risks of government manipulation and overshooting that are sometimes raised when debiasing through law is employed. © 2006 by The University of Chicago.

A 2 (no scent vs. Christmas scent)×2 (non-Christmas music vs. Christmas music) experimental design was implemented in a mock retail store. Results indicate that the effects of adding an ambient Christmas scent are moderated by the nature of the background music.

When viewed as economic agents who participate in electronic markets, it is easy to see that users' preferences, behaviors, personalities, and ultimately their economic welfare are intricately linked to the design of information systems. We use a data-driven, inductive approach to develop a taxonomy of bidding behavior in online auctions. Our analysis indicates significant heterogeneity exists in the user base of these representative electronic markets. Using online auction data from 1999 and 2000, we find a stable taxonomy of bidder behavior containing five types of bidding strategies. Bidders pursue different bidding strategies that, in aggregate, realize different winning likelihoods and consumer surplus. We find that technological evolution has an impact on bidders' strategies. We demonstrate how the taxonomy of bidder behavior can be used to enhance the design of some types of information systems. These enhancements include developing user-centric bidding agents, inferring bidders' under-lying valuations to facilitate real-time auction calibration, and creating low-risk computational platforms for decision making.","Bidding strategies; Calibration; Electronic markets; Online auctions; Simulation; Smart agents; User behavior taxonomy; Valuation discovery","Calibration; Cognitive systems; Computational methods; Computer simulation; Decision making; Marketing; Online systems; Bidding strategies; Electronic markets; Online auctions; Smart agents; User behavior taxonomy; Valuation discovery; Information analysis","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-9744282683"

However, only a few researchers have used the context of mobile auctions to explore the impulsive buying behaviors of consumers. Therefore, our study selects the mobile auction platform to explore how situational factors affect impulsive buying behavior. We integrate the S-O-R model, impulsivity traits and other external variables to establish our research model and hypotheses. Our results show that the personality factors of an impulsive buying tendency, normative evaluation, and positive affect are key determinants of impulse buying, while ubiquity, ease of use, information exchange, discounted price, and scarcity are important precursors. In addition, gender and platform categorizations are also used to classify the sample to determine the differences between groups defined by these classifications.

Results show a 255% increase in the number of households that use grocery pickup as a shopping method and a 158% increase in households that utilize grocery delivery services. The spike in pickup and delivery program participation can be explained by consumers fearing COVID-19 and feeling unsafe.

These externalities include environmental and road damage, accidents, congestion, and oil dependence. The cost of these externalities to society is in general not reflected in the current market prices in the road transport sector. An efficient mobility model for the future must take into account the true costs of transport and its regulatory framework will need to create incentives for people to make sustainable transport choices. This paper discusses the use of economic instruments to correct road transport externalities, but gives relatively more weight to the problem of carbon emissions from road transport, as this is particularly challenging, given its global and long-term nature. Economics offers two types of instruments for addressing the problem of transport externalities: command-and-control and incentive-based policies. Command-and-control policies are government regulations which force consumers and producers to change their behaviour. They are the most widely used policy instruments. Examples include vehicle emission and fuel standards in the US as well as driving or parking restrictions in Singapore. The implementation cost of these instruments to the government is small. Although from an economic perspective these policies often fail to achieve an efficient market outcome, the presence of political constraints often make them the preferred option, in terms of feasibility and effectiveness. Economic theory shows how policies, which affect consumption and production incentives, can be used to achieve the optimal outcome in the presence of externalities. Incentive-based policies function within a new or an altered market. We first examine incentive-based policies, which cap the aggregate amount of the externality, such as carbon emissions, by allocating permits or rights to the emitters. The emitters are then free to trade their permits amongst them. The permit allocation mechanism is important-although market efficiency would be satisfied by an auction, political influences usually favour a proportional allocation based on historic emissions. We discuss EU ETS as an example of a cap-and-trade system, however, no such policy for CO2 emissions in road transport has been implemented anywhere in the world to date. Fiscal instruments are, like command-and-control, widely used in road transport, because they are relatively cheap and simple to implement. They include the use of taxes and charges in order to bridge the gap between private and the social costs and, in principle, can lead to an efficient market solution. Registration, ownership, fuel, emissions, usage taxes, and parking and congestion charges have been implemented in many countries around the world. On the other side of the spectrum, subsidies can be given to those scrapping old cars and buying fuel-efficient vehicles. Some cities, such as London, have implemented congestion charges and many states in the United States have introduced high occupancy lanes. Other interesting possibilities include pay-as-you-drive insurance and other usage charges. However, the size and scope of taxes and subsidies are determined by governments, and because of their imperfect knowledge of the market the outcome is still likely to be inefficient. Governments have many effective economic instruments to create a sustainable road transport model. These instruments can be used separately or together, but their implementation will be necessary in the nearest future. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

More specifically, this paper proposed and tested a theoretical model that examined whether recognizing the ulterior motive caused consumer skepticism about hotels’ environmental claims, which in turn influenced consumers’ intention to participate in linen reuse program and intention to revisit the hotel. Additionally, the moderating effects of ecological concern on the relationship between skepticism and intention to participate and between skepticism and intention to revisit were examined. Design/methodology/approach – A quasi-experimental design was used with two conditions (control vs ulterior motive) employing staff members of a US public university as study participants. In total, 638 useful responses were received. Findings – The results of this study revealed that an ulterior motive of hotels’ environmental claims evoked consumer skepticism, which, in turn, negatively influenced consumers’ intention to participate in the linen reuse program and intention to revisit the hotel. Skepticism was found to partially mediate the relationships between ulterior motive and intention to participate and between ulterior motive and intention to revisit. Consumers’ ecological concern was not found to moderate the relationship between skepticism and intention to participate in the linen reuse program and skepticism and intention to revisit the hotel. In addition, a significant positive direct effect between ecological concern and intention to participate and a non-significant effect between ecological concern and revisit intention were revealed. Research limitations/implications – Focus on consumers’ response to the ulterior motive of environmental claims advances an understanding of consumers’ attitudes and perceptions about hotels’ green practices. Practical implications – Findings suggest that hotels need to be watchful so that consumers do not become skeptical. Therefore, it is of utmost importance that managers do everything possible to give customers no room for doubt. Hoteliers need to spend more effort in installing comprehensive green programs and make true green claims by keeping the potential consequences of greenwashing in mind. Hoteliers also need to seek out third-party certifications that require the hotel to meet certain standards, which will help ensure credibility in the eyes of consumers. Originality/value – Hospitality literature has seldom explored this gray area of green marketing, and, in this regard, this study serves as a guide to hoteliers and researchers alike. The authors thereby anticipate that this study would encourage more research in this often overlooked but highly important area. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Corporate social responsibility; Environmental concerns; Green hotel; Greenwashing; Skepticism; Sustainability","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84937792373"

Unfortunately, among consumers, there is limited engagement in this behaviour. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to expand the knowledge base of eco-conscious apparel consumption and question the limited participation by identifying barriers that constrain consumers. This study used a qualitative approach to collect and analyse data from 26 eco-conscious consumers. Data collection for the study occurred through semi-structured interviews. Results indicate that consumers find it difficult to engage in eco-conscious apparel acquisition on a consistent basis because a number of barriers stand in the way. These barriers include knowledge and attitudes about environmentally preferable apparel, availability of environmentally preferable apparel, economic resources, retail environments and societal norms. Consequently, the implication is that strategies intending to encourage eco-conscious apparel acquisition should include a focus on diminishing these barriers. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Apparel; Barriers; Consumer behaviour; Consumption; Eco-conscious","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-79955738498"

The present study explores the effects of self-influencer congruence on brand attitude, brand engagement, and purchase intention in China’s dynamic social media context. The perceived motive of social media influencer’s endorsement behavior, parasocial identification with social media influencers, and their roles in the endorsement process were examined. The results of this study suggest that a high degree of congruence between the image of a social media influencer and the consumer’s ideal self-image leads to effective endorsement outcomes.

Further, we reveal that this tendency can manifest in behaviors that appear selfish, but also in behaviors that appear generous, in conditions where generosity allows for personal gains. The current research thus offers a more nuanced understanding of why resource scarcity may promote behaviors that appear either selfish or generous in different contexts, and provides one way to reconcile seemingly conflicting prior findings. © The Author 2015.","Competitive orientation; Generous; Resource scarcity; Selfish; Welfare advancement","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84973151652"

Behavioral reasoning theory (BRT) is a relatively new theory that determines the linkage between beliefs, reasons, motives, intentions, and behavior. This study conducts a systematic literature review (SLR) to synthesize the existing body of knowledge around BRT. The present SLR critically examines the origin of this theory and its linkages with other behavioral theories, thus providing insightful knowledge on its foundations. Further, it presents the state-of-the-art research knowledge, research themes, implications, and future directions related to BRT literature. Our analysis shows that the reasons for and reasons against construct plays an important role in predicting consumer behavior. This study also finds that research related to BRT is growing rapidly and needs methodological advancements. These findings will enable scholars and practitioners to better understand how BRT works, what its strengths and potential are, the contexts in which it has been utilized, its existing limitations, and the sort of methodological advancements needed in future studies on marketing. © 2020 The Author(s)","Behavioral reasoning theory (BRT); Behavioral theories; Consumer behavior; Marketing and systematic literature review","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85085198909"

Based on the findings from 27 semi-structured interviews with wellness tourists a benefits of wellness tourism scale (BWTS) was developed. It was used to measure 46 benefit items and was mailed to people included on the client/member lists of three Australian wellness tourism organisations. In total, six benefit factors emerged from a principal axis factor analysis: transcendence; physical health and appearance; escape and relaxation; important others and novelty; re-establish self-esteem; and indulgence. A one-way MANOVA, followed by a series of ANOVAS, revealed significant differences between the three types of tourists regarding the importance attributed to each of the six benefit factors. While all participants in the study sought transformation of the self, each identifiable group of tourists placed different emphasis on physical, psychological or spiritual transformations. Moreover, each group differed significantly in terms of demographic and travel behaviour characteristics. The relevance of this paper lies in its adoption of a comprehensive approach to the investigation of the potential differences between three wellness tourist groups regarding the socio-demographic profile, travel behaviour, and the benefits sought. Previous studies have focused on a single particular wellness tourist group. Furthermore, the BWTS may be applicable for use in future comparative studies of wellness tourist motivation. © 2011, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Consumer behaviour; Personal health; Tourism","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84868257913"

Few prior studies on the adoption of business-to-consumer e-commerce have considered trust in information technology as an important determinant of adoption behavior. This research explicitly encompasses the electronic channel and the merchant as objects to be trusted in a specific e-commerce application, i.e. Internet banking. Our conceptual model posits that initial trust in the electronic channel as a banking medium and trust in bank are the major determinants of adoption behavior. Based on social network theory and trust theory, determinants of trust in the electronic channel such as propensity-to-trust, word-of-mouth (WOM) referrals, structural assurances, are included in the research model. The analyses of independent variables indicated that propensity-to-trust, structural assurances, and relational content of WOM were significant predictors of initial trust in the electronic channel. Our findings also indicated that a significant relationship exists between initial trust in the electronic channel and the adoption of Internet banking. However, further analysis revealed that trust could be a necessary but not a sufficient condition for the adoption of Internet banking. © 2004, Authors.

The results of two studies provide support to the general working of this theoretical framework.

Despite the unquestionable relevance of this area of inquiry, the focal literature concerning omnichannel retailing remains sporadic and fragmented. With this in mind, the purpose of the current paper is to provide a comprehensive and concise state of the art literature review on omnichannel retailing. More specifically, we engage and draw upon the cognitive-affective-conative model to understand consumer behaviour within the omnichannel retailing context. The current study is built based on a review of total 131 research papers that were identified following a comprehensive search of the Web of Science database, capturing the time period between January 2011 and April 2020. This set of work was reviewed thoroughly to explore the aims, methodology and key contributions. In addition to engaging a systematic assessment and rigorous evaluation of the studies, we also extend literature by studying the relationship between omnichannel retailing and consumer decision making, with specific attention to consumer motivation, attitude and behaviour towards omnichannel retailing. Previous studies suggest consumer behaviour in omnichannel retailing to be a promising yet underexplored area with several potential avenues for future research. Among these, particularly lucrative directions include theory-driven research, comparative cross-cultural studies and qualitative approaches that capture rich first-hand accounts of consumer decision-making encounters. The current paper is timely and advantageous because it offers a holistic picture of omnichannel retailing research and provides literature-driven evidence about a range of relevant consumer behavioural dimensions. It also integrates consumer responses using the cognitive-affective-conative model to advance our understanding of consumer decision-making in the omnichannel customer journey. Recommendations for future research are provided using the Theory, Methodology and Context (TMC) framework. We conclude the paper by discussing implications for academics and practitioners. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","cognitive-affective-conative model; consumer behaviour; decision-making; literature review; omnichannel; retailing","","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85092779700"

However, research on mechanisms which harness these specific customer engagement behaviours (CEB) in branded social media platforms is limited. Based on the stimulus–organism–response paradigm, this study investigates how specific online-service design characteristics in social media brand pages induce customer-perceived value perceptions, which in turn, stimulate feedback and collaboration intentions with customers. Design/methodology/approach: Data collected from 654 US consumers of brand pages on Facebook were used to empirically test the proposed framework via structural equation modelling. Findings: The theoretical framework found support for most hypothesized relationships showing how online-service design characteristics induce an identified set of customer value perceptions that influence customer feedback and collaboration intentions. Research limitations/implications: The sample is restricted to customer evaluations of brand pages on Facebook in the USA. Practitioners are advised to maximize online-service design characteristics of content quality, brand page interactivity, sociability and customer contact quality as stimulants that induce brand learning value, entitativity value and hedonic value. This then translates to customer feedback and collaboration intentions towards the brand page.

For this reason, this work aims to explore some of the effects of participation in a virtual brand community on consumer behaviour. Design/methodology/approach - The paper proposes the positive effects of participation in a virtual community on both consumer trust and loyalty to the product, brand or organisation around which the community is developed. In addition, it also proposes a positive effect of trust on consumer loyalty. After the validations of measurement scales, the hypotheses are contrasted through structural modelling. Findings - The data, obtained through a web survey using members of several free software virtual communities, show that participation in the activities carried out in a virtual community may foster consumer trust and loyalty to the mutual interest of the community (the free software in this case). In addition, the study also found a positive and significant effect of consumer trust on loyalty. Research limitations/implications - Data were collected thanks to a web survey using Spanish-speaking subjects. Practical implications - The high costs every company has to face in order to get new customers make it increasingly necessary to reinforce the ties established with customers. In this respect, this study has shown that managers may foster consumer trust and loyalty by developing virtual brand communities and promoting consumers' participation in them. Originality/value - Most of the works that are focused on virtual communities have been conducted at the conceptual level. Thus, with the aim of moving on this topic, this study analyses empirically the effects of participation in a virtual brand community on consumer behaviour. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Brands; Computer software; Customer loyalty; Trust; Virtual organizations","Computer software; Data privacy; Decision making; Information management; Online systems; Operating costs; Societies and institutions; World Wide Web; Brands; Customer loyalty; Virtual organizations; Virtual reality","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-36448954655"

If you think the answer is ""Just more of the same,"" you're in for a surprise. Howe and Strauss, the authors of Generations, The Fourth Turning, Millenniais Rising, and other books, have studied the differences among generations for some 30 years. Their extensive research has revealed a fascinating pattern -one so strong that it supports a measure of predictability. On the basis of historical precedent, they say, we can foresee how the generations that are alive today will think and act in decades to come. Three of those generations will still be vital forces in American society 20 years from now: Boomers, Generation X, and Millennial. Their attitudes and behaviors will have profound effects on the economy, the workplace, and social institutions in general. For example, as aging Boomers eschew high-tech medicine in favor of holistic self-care, natural foods, and mind-body healing techniques, some hospitals are opening new wings featuring alternative medicine and spiritual counseling. Gen Xers, having grown up in an era of failing schools and marriages, will remain alienated, disaffected, and pragmatic as they enter midlife. Already the greatest entrepreneurial generation in U.S. history, they will be highly effective at pushing innovation, efficiency, and mass customization.

Especially, the paper explores the “building blocks” of the Metaverse and how it is functioning in a case study. Design/methodology/approach: The Metaverse concept is explained by the Nike–Roblox case study, where the authors explore the customer benefits, that are provided by the Nikeland project. Findings: The Nike–Roblox case study is showing that virtual platforms, content services, consumer and business behavior are the most important and visible “building blocks” to the Nikeland visitors (customers) in the Nike–Roblox alliance. The Metaverse is gaining popularity among the big global brands. It is expected that the big breakthrough for Metaverse will happen when the next layer of brands, the regional and local brands, will start penetrating the Metaverse. Originality/value: Metaverse will be the new future marketing platform for presenting and giving life to all kinds of brands in the 3D interactive digital space. Metaverse is a digital copy of how we are working in the physical world. In this 3D digital space, the users can come together via avatars that resemble them. This will have an enormous effect on how companies will use the marketing function and how we will communicate with each other in future. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Avatar; Marketing; Nike; Social media marketing; Virtual reality","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85126366134"

This paper uses a panel data set from Russia, an economy in which household debt has grown at an astounding rate, to examine the importance of financial literacy and its effects on behavior. The paper studies both the financial and real consequences of financial illiteracy. Even though consumer borrowing increased very rapidly in Russia, only 41% of respondents demonstrate an understanding of interest compounding and only 46% can answer a simple question about inflation. Financial literacy is positively related to participation in financial markets and negatively related to the use of informal sources of borrowing. Moreover, individuals with higher financial literacy are significantly less likely to report experiencing a negative income shock during 2009 and have greater availability of unspent income and higher spending capacity. The relationship between financial literacy and availability of unspent income is higher in 2009, suggesting that financial literacy may better equip individuals to deal with macroeconomic shocks. © 2013 .","Financial crisis; Financial inclusion; Financial literacy; Russia","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84881087754"

Because consumers are vulnerable in their dealings with businesses due to a lack of information about and an inability to control the subsequent use of their personal information, we argue that organizations have a moral responsibility to these individuals to avoid causing harm and to take reasonable precautions toward that end. We further argue that firms can enhance their privacy programs by moving beyond merely complying with laws and other regulations and creating a culture of integrity that combines a concern for the law with an emphasis on managerial responsibility for the firm's organizational privacy behaviors. We use two high-profile data breaches experienced by two U.S. companies, ChoicePoint and TJX, to illustrate our arguments for enhancing organizational level privacy programs based on ethical reasoning. In doing so, this paper contributes to the dearth of prior organizationallevel privacy research, which has largely overlooked ethical issues or the personal harms often caused by privacy violations.

These appraisals, in turn, affect how a consumer responds emotionally and behaviorally. Using an appraisal-tendency framework, we predict that two negatively valenced emotions (anger and regret) underlie or mediate the effects of consumers' appraisals about service failure on post-purchase behaviors. Consistent with the predictions, in a laboratory study, we find that anger plays a powerful role in explaining retaliatory behaviors, and that both anger and regret account for the effect of appraisals on conciliatory behaviors. We extend the same appraisal-tendency framework to predict how changes in emotions underlie the effects of recovery efforts on post-purchase behaviors. Again consistent with predictions, in the laboratory study and in a web-based study, we find that recovery efforts that reduce anger decrease retaliatory behaviors. However, both studies provide less clear-cut evidence about the emotional mediators between recovery efforts and conciliatory behaviors. Because conciliatory behaviors are important behaviors for businesses to promote, future research should explore what other emotions explain recovery effort effects on conciliatory behaviors. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2007.","Anger; Post-purchase; Recovery; Regret","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-34247574271"

This study develops the concept of face and face consumption to explain why Asian consumers possess strong appetites for luxury products despite their relatively low income. This paper distinguishes the concept of face from a closely related construct, prestige, and examines the influence of face on consumer behaviours in the United States and China. Due to the heavy influence of face, Asian consumers believe they must purchase luxury products to enhance, maintain or save face. Accordingly, face consumption has three unique characteristics: conformity, distinctiveness and other-orientation. The results of a cross-cultural survey support the existence of these three subdimensions and show that Chinese consumers are more likely to be influenced by their reference groups than are American consumers. Furthermore, they tend to relate product brands and price to face more heavily than do their US counterparts. In addition, Chinese consumers are more likely to consider the prestige of the products in other-oriented consumption than are their American counterparts. © 2007 The Market Research Society.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-33947583441"

What are the social welfare effects of such information exchange? I study these questions by comparing the oligopolists' expected profits under a cost sharing agreement with their expected profits in the Bayesian equilibrium that would arise without cost sharing. I also analyse the firms' decisions to form a trade association to share their cost data. Under conditions of linear demand and Cournot behaviour, industry wide information exchange is the unique point in the core of the trade association membership game. The exchange of cost data increases expected profits and welfare, but reduces expected consumer surplus. Cost sharing increases efficiency by raising the market shares of lower cost firms and reducing the variability of aggregate output. Consumer surplus is diminished, however, because the variance of output is reduced, and consumer surplus is a convex function of output. © 1986 Oxford University Press.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84962992157"

Although latterly marketers are recognising the value of older consumers, research has not yet examined their attitudes and behaviour towards ethical consumption. From the collection of individual interviews conducted for this study, it would seem that older people share a sense of moral responsibility in their purchase behaviour, and as a community are willing to engage in affirmative purchasing and boycotting. Although there are perceived barriers to their participation in broader ethical purchasing activities, they would appear to be a potentially significant force in the consumer resistance movement. The findings suggest that as a group, older consumers should be considered as an important target market for ethical marketers who wish to benefit from their collective sense of social obligation.","Consumer behaviour; Consumption; Ethics; Older consumers","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-8844270210"

Refurbishment is a process in which a professional company collects and restores used products in order to resell these products to new consumers. Building on insights from the remanufacturing literature, this research is the first to provide a comprehensive understanding of the factors that influence consumer acceptance of refurbished products, and in specific refurbished mobile phones. We adopted a qualitative approach using in-depth interviews with consumers (n = 20) of new and refurbished phones to gain rich insights into consumers' considerations that play a role in the choice of a refurbished product over a new product. This paper maps out the main factors that influence consumer acceptance of refurbished mobile phones. Our findings uncover that the majority of consumers do not take a refurbished product into consideration as a consequence of a lack of awareness and a misunderstanding of what refurbishment actually entails. In addition, refurbished products are often rejected as a consequence of a negative trade-off between perceived risks and benefits. Personal, contextual and product-related factors have been identified that influence consumers' assessment of a refurbished product's risks and benefits. Finally, the findings have been translated into practical guidelines for designers and marketers to positively steer consumer perception of refurbished products. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

'Sustainable consumption' has become a core policy objective of the new millennium in national and international arenas, and the paper critically evaluates the UK policy model of sustainable consumption as a tool for ecological citizenship. It first reviews the debate about sustainable consumption and describes two competing perspectives: one concerned with reform of the mainstream, and another more radical alternative. It then appraises the mainstream policy model of sustainable consumption in the light of ecological citizenship goals, and identifies a number of failures. Turning to the alternative perspective of sustainable consumption, a number of initiatives are discussed which are able to overcome the limitations of the mainstream model in enabling individual consumers to be good ecological citizens. Finally, the policy implications of this analysis are drawn out in order to nurture the practice of ecological citizenship. © 2005 Taylor & Francis Group Ltd.","","citizenship; consumption behavior; environmental politics; sustainability","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-21444439223"

The results show that consumers' ethical beliefs are determined, in part, by who is at fault in the unethical behavior (the seller or the buyer). The results also indicate that those with a more positive attitude toward business are less likely to engage in questionable consumer practices, but one's attitudes toward salespeople, the government and people in general are not related to the consumer's ethical beliefs. © 1992 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0001323450"

This model encompasses strategic behavior by both firms and consumers in a unified stochastic dynamic game in which each firm's objective is to maximize its total expected revenues, and each consumer responds according to a shopping-intensity-allocation consumer choice model. We prove the existence of a unique subgame-perfect equilibrium, provide equilibrium optimality conditions, and prove monotonicity results for special cases. The model provides insights about equilibrium price dynamics under different levels of competition, asymmetry between firms, and multiple market segments with varying properties. We demonstrate that strategic behavior by consumers can have serious impacts on revenues if firms ignore that behavior in their dynamic pricing policies. Moreover, ideal equilibrium responses to consumer strategic behavior can recover only a portion of the lost revenues. A key conclusion is that firms may benefit more from limiting the information available to consumers than from allowing full information and responding to the resulting strategic behavior in an optimal fashion. © 2009 INFORMS.","Competition; Dynamic pricing; Stochastic dynamic games; Strategic consumer behavior","Competition; Costs; Game theory; Random processes; Stochastic models; Consumer choice; Dynamic pricing; Equilibrium price; Expected revenue; Finite segments; Monotonicity; Multiple markets; Oligopolistic competition; Optimality conditions; Stochastic dynamic games; Stochastic dynamics; Strategic Behavior; Strategic consumer behavior; Economics","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-67650090653"

Design/methodology/approach – A total of 600 respondents living in one of the biggest cities in Brazil were sampled for interviewing: 300 were internet bank users, 150 were internet but not internet bank users, and 150 were neither internet nor internet bank users. Findings – The adjusted coefficient of determination in the multiple linear regression equation (dependent variable: intention to use/continue to use IB) was 60 percent and the main effects of the eight variables proved significant (relative advantage of control, compatibility with lifestyle, image, subjective norm, self-efficacy, relative advantage of security and privacy, results demonstrability, and trialability). The McFaden pseudo coefficient of determination in the multinomial logistic regression equation (dependent variable: a dummy variable for each of the three groups analyzed) ranged from 45 percent to 69 percent. The findings show that the variables that influence the intention to use/continue to use IB are not exactly the same as those that influence actual adoption. Specifically, the results seem to suggest that intention to use IB is influenced solely by people's beliefs about IB, while its actual adoption is influenced also by individual characteristics. Originality/value – The findings herein suggest that the proposed integrated model offers superior ability to explain adoption of internet banking to that of the models elected by previous studies. Furthermore, the model looks not only into the intentions but also into actual adoption. © 2007, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Consumer behavior; Electronic commerce; Internet","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-33846968861"

This price explosion was unexpected and has called into question whether electricity restructuring will bring the benefits of competition promised to consumers. The purpose of this paper is to examine the factors that explain this increase in wholesale electricity prices. We simulate competitive benchmark prices for Summer of 2000 taking account of all relevant supply and demand factors-gas prices, demand, imports from other states, and emission permit prices. We then compare the simulated competitive benchmark prices with the actual prices observed. We find that there is a large gap between our benchmark competitive prices and observed prices, suggesting that the prices observed during Summer 2000 reflect, in part, the exercise of market power by suppliers. We then proceed to examine supplier behavior during high-price hours. We find evidence that suppliers withheld supply from the market that would have been profitable for price-taking firms to sell at the market price.","","Competitive intelligence; Computer simulation; Cost benefit analysis; Electric industry; Electric load management; Electric power distribution; Electricity; Gas emissions; Hydroelectric power; Nitrogen oxides; Benchmark competitive price; Electricity market; Wholesale electricity price; Electric rates","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-0036408449"

There were two studies performed in this research. Study 1 validated the self-regulating processes; Study 2 tested the moderating effects of customer perceived value between satisfaction and loyalty. Structural equation modelling techniques and linear hierarchical regression models were used to test the causal model. The study demonstrated that e-service quality and customer perceived value influence customer satisfaction, and then influence customer loyalty. In addition this study found that customers with a high perceived value have a stronger relationship between satisfaction and customer loyalty than customers with a low perceived value. We found that there are emotional and rational routes influencing customer loyalty in the online shopping process. This will contribute to other research that clarifies the influencing process of online shoppers' motivation and behaviour. In the pre-purchase stage, online retailers should focus on attracting consumers by the quality of e-service. In the purchase stage, online retailers should address the emotional factors, such as customer satisfaction. In the post-purchase stage, rational factors – such as customer perceived value – play important roles because they can strengthen the relationship between satisfaction and loyalty. This study viewed the purchase process as a different stage as consumers may make a choice at each of the purchase stages. Moreover this study found a way to examine the relationship between customer satisfaction and loyalty by exploring the moderating effects of customer perceived value. © 2011, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Customer perceived value; Electronic service quality; Internet marketing; Loyalty; Perception; Satisfaction; Value added","Electronic commerce; Purchasing; Quality of service; Regression analysis; Research; Sales; Customer perceived values; Electronic services; Internet marketing; Loyalty; Satisfaction; Value added; Customer satisfaction","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-79959890910"

This study tests a conceptual model linking PRs and CRs to four consumer beliefs (perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, perceived affective quality, and trust) in two different product settings (search products versus experience products). Results of an experimental study show that users of PRs express significantly higher perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use than users of CRs, while users of CRs express higher trusting beliefs and perceived affective quality than users of PRs, resulting in different effect mechanisms toward OPR reuse and purchase intentions in e-commerce transactions. Further, CRs were found to elicit higher perceived usefulness, trusting beliefs, and perceived affective quality for experience goods, while PRs were found to unfold higher effects on all of these variables for search goods. © 2012 M.E.

This requires an understanding of visitor expectations, and experiences, of visiting a museum. However, for the most part, public museums have concentrated their research efforts into obtaining statistical data which measure through‐put and provide demographic profiles, ignoring in the process the nature of the experience itself. This paper looks at research derived primarily from academics working in the field of visitor studies. It outlines three approaches; the social, the cognitive, and the environmental perspective, which have been applied to studies of museum visitor behaviour. The paper then presents the findings from an observational study of visitors to a city museum. These findings are recast in the light of the three approaches described, in order to offer an integrated framework of customer behaviour which has implications for the management of the service encounter in museums. © 2000, MCB UP Limited.","Consumer behaviour; Museums; Qualitative techniques; Services marketing","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85133224199"

In the first era (1930-1960), the founders of the field invented the basic components of the design of data collection and the tools to produce the statistical information from surveys. As they were inventing the method, they were also building the institutions that conduct surveys in the private, academic, and government sectors. The second era (1960-1990) witnessed a vast growth in the use of the survey method. This growth was aided by the needs of the U.S. federal government to monitor the effects of investments in human and physical infrastructure, the growth of the quantitative social sciences, and the use of quantitative information to study consumer behaviors. The third era (1990 and forward) witnessed the declines in survey participation rates, the growth of alternative modes of data collection, the weakening of sampling frames, and the growth of continuously produced process data from digital systems in all sectors, but especially those emanating from the Internet. Throughout each era, survey research methods adapted to changes in society and exploited new technologies when they proved valuable to the field. © The Author 2011.","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84055188781"

Previous research on legitimacy in consumer behavior has focused on the consumer reception of legitimizing discourse rather than on the historical process of legitimation itself. This study examines the influence of changes in the institutional environment over time on the meaning structures that influence consumer perception and practice. To study legitimation as a historical process, a discourse analysis of newspaper articles about casino gambling from 1980-2007 was conducted. Results show that the regulatory approval of gambling is accompanied by a shift in the semantic categories used to discuss casinos and that journalists play a role in shaping these categories. Further, journalists shape the meaning of a consumption practice in three ways: through selection, validation, and realization. Interpreted through the lens of institutional theory, these findings suggest that studies of legitimation should consider changes in public discourse and legal regulation in addition to consumer perceptions of legitimacy. © 2010 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-77957929460"

However, extant research has not addressed these mobile financial services apps (MFSAs) adequately from the perspective of consumer behavior. Thus, the present study developed and tested a series of hypotheses related to the antecedents of perceived value of MFSA use; it also examined how such use affects the development of customers’ overall relationships with banks. Our hypotheses were tested using two samples (N = 992; N = 524) comprising different types of MFSA end-users in one of the leading countries in digital banking, Finland. The results supported most of the hypotheses and revealed that self-congruence and new product novelty are the principal drivers of perceived MFSA value. In addition, the findings show that the perceived value of MFSAs yields strong positive effects on customers’ overall satisfaction and commitment to their bank. The present study's key managerial implication is that banks’ investments in developing MFSAs result in improved relationships with customers and increased business. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Mobile financial services apps; New product novelty; Perceived value; Personal innovativeness; Self-congruence","Customer satisfaction; Electronic money; Finance; Information services; Sales; Financial service; New product novelty; Perceived value; Personal innovativeness; Self-congruence; Consumer behavior","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85053882434"

The task of predicting a target population was considered from a cognitive or informational perspective: Subjects were viewed as having to first identify and then correctly weight various predictive cues, in this case their own attitudes and other specific or stereotypic information about the target. A model was developed to show how subjects should optimally weight their own positions compared with whatever other target-related information was available to them. Subjects predicted the attitudes of one of three target populations: the average, married American consumer; their average graduate school peer; or their spouse. The results indicated that although perceived consensus was quite high, 65% of the subjects could have actually increased their predictive accuracy by weighting their own positions even more. The heuristic value of relying on own positions varied dramatically depending on the target population: Although 63% of subjects predicting the attitudes of consumers projected too much, only 16% and 24% of subjects predicting attitudes of peers and spouses overprojected. Even when subjects perceived more consensus than actually existed, they often could have increased predictive accuracy by relying more heavily on their own attitudes because they seemed to have difficulty in identifying and consistently using other information about the target. © 1987 American Psychological Association.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0000571985"

This study examined changes to consumer food purchases after the introduction of traffic-light labels with the aim of assessing the impact of the labels on the 'healthiness' of foods purchased. The study examined sales data from a major UK retailer in 2007. We analysed products in two categories ('ready meals' and sandwiches), investigating the percentage change in sales 4 weeks before and after traffic-light labels were introduced, and taking into account seasonality, product promotions and product life-cycle. We investigated whether changes in sales were related to the healthiness of products. All products that were not new and not on promotion immediately before or after the introduction of traffic-light labels were selected for the analysis (n = 6 for ready meals and n = 12 for sandwiches). For the selected ready-meals, sales increased (by 2.4 of category sales) in the 4 weeks after the introduction of traffic-light labels, whereas sales of the selected sandwiches did not change significantly. Critically, there was no association between changes in product sales and the healthiness of the products. This short-term study based on a small number of ready meals and sandwiches found that the introduction of a system of four traffic-light labels had no discernable effect on the relative healthiness of consumer purchases. Further research on the influence of nutrition signposting will be needed before this labelling format can be considered a promising public health intervention.","Barriers; Diabetes; Exercise","Fast Foods; Food Labeling; Food Preferences; Great Britain; Health Behavior; Health Promotion; Humans; Nutritive Value; article; food packaging; health promotion; human; life cycle; nutrition; priority journal; public health; seasonal variation; United Kingdom","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-72649091045"

Survey and experimental results indicate that the more self-relevant a consumer-brand relationship, the more likely are anti-brand retaliatory behaviors after the relationship ends. These antibrand behaviors are diverse: from complaining to third parties, to negative word of mouth, to illegal actions such as theft, threats, and vandalism. In contrast, post-exit consumer-brand relationships that were low in self-relevance but were high in trust, commitment, and satisfaction are less likely to result in anti-brand actions. The role of a discrete product or service failure is also explored, and results suggest that self-relevance may motivate retaliation even in the absence of a so-called critical incident. Ultimately, this research illuminates previously unexplored mechanisms-including self-conscious emotional reactions-that motivate consumer hostility and retaliation. © 2010 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-79956286307"

Based on a comprehensive review of TLHM literature, the search returned a total of 1559 full-text articles. After applying the criteria for selection without a specified period, a total of 259 publications from 98 high-impact journals indexed in SSCI, SCI, and ESCI using Scopus CiteScore metrics were included to be reviewed. Unlike previous studies, the current study contributes to the existing literature by conducting a systematic review of the TPB literature with a holistic view and providing up-to-date research findings in the field. The results of the study suggested the following conclusions: (i) TPB, which has widely been extended to different contexts in TLHM literature recently, differs from most social psychology theories in terms of feasibility; (ii) the theory mainly covers consumer behavior and there are few studies addressing managerial or employee-related issues, (iii) the previous studies seem to be dominated by the survey-based methods posing various limitations in practice.

The adjusted scores for the ADA show a strong liberal trend in the average member of Congress during 1947-94, followed by a conservative reversal. A nonparametric test using ADA and ACU scores demonstrates the validity of adjusted scores and the invalidity of nominal scores for intertemporal and interchamber comparisons.

That consciousness forces companies not only to develop eco-friendly products, but also motivates practitioners and academicians to understand the eco-friendly buying behaviour of the customer. Yet in current literature, there is little discussion available where researchers talk about the influencing relationship of altruistic and egoistic values of customers on their attitudes and purchase intentions towards eco-friendly packaged products. Therefore, this work aims to build a structural model to establish the relationship between egoistic and altruistic values on customers’ attitudes and their intention to purchase products with eco-friendly packaging. With the help of a structured questionnaire, data from 227 young Indian customers was collected. An empirical investigation was carried out and the conceptual model was tested using Structural Equation Modelling (SEM). The analysis indicates that these values do influence purchase intention for products with eco-friendly packaging. However, altruistic value exerts greater influence than egoistic value. This research provides relevant findings about young consumers and their response to products with ecological packaging. These findings will assist marketers in reducing the environmental footprint caused by packaging materials, helping them to retain customers as a result. From the Asian perspective, the present research is among the early efforts towards understanding the significance of values (altruistic and egoistic) pertaining to products with ecological packaging. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Altruistic value; Eco-friendly packaging; Egoistic value; Environmental concern; Health concern","altruism; conceptual framework; consumption behavior; environmental impact; health impact; modeling; numerical model; public attitude","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85065708113"

Unsustainable usage modes and user behavior are increasingly serious problems confronting DBS in China that may substantially threaten its profits and supply. While existing studies have mainly focused on how to promote DBS, the issue of the sustainable usage of shared bikes has been largely overlooked. This paper examined the determinants affecting users’ sustainable usage intention and behavior by incorporating awareness of consequences and moral obligation into the theory of planned behavior. Based on partial least squares structural equation modeling, the questionnaire data of 705 users (67.92% of all respondents) who had used DBS in sustainable ways were empirically analyzed. The results revealed that perceived behavioral control and moral obligation are the most important factors driving users’ sustainable usage intention and behavior and that behavioral attitude and subjective norms also present significant positive effects on sustainable usage intention. In contrast to the hypothesized relationship, the awareness of consequences does not play a significant role in sustainable usage intention. Moreover, the empirical results ascertained that the extended model has stronger interpretation ability than the original model in predicting DBS users’ sustainable usage behavior. Eventually, some targeted managerial implications are proposed. This study enhances the current understanding of the sustainable usage behavior of DBS users and provides timely insights for policymakers and operators promoting sustainable bike-sharing practices in China and other countries operating DBS programs. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Bike sharing; Consumer behavior; Moral obligation; Sharing economy; Sustainable consumption; Theory of planned behavior","China; Bicycles; Least squares approximations; Bike sharing; Moral obligations; Sharing economy; Sustainable consumption; Theory of Planned Behavior; consumption behavior; cycle transport; mobility; psychology; sustainability; adult; article; awareness; China; consumer attitude; economic aspect; female; human; human experiment; male; morality; partial least squares regression; questionnaire; structural equation modeling; Theory of Planned Behavior; Consumer behavior","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85072804589"

First, we tried to find out how five consumption values of functional, social, emotional, conditional, and epistemic in classic TCV influence consumption choice especially in the sustainable consumption domain of organic food, interpreted as green perceived value (GPV) in the reflective-reflective second-order latent. Second, as an attempt to extend the classic TRA, this study included trust and perceived knowledge in the research model in addition to the subjective norm, attitude, and behavioral intention. A partial least square structural equation method (PLS-SEM) was adopted to examine our research model with 251 samples. Our results revealed that GPV significantly affects consumer attitudes.

As an extended TRA, GPV has a significantly positive effect on trust while trust significantly impacts purchase intention. Further, perceived knowledge positively influences attitude and trust.

Though, the Chinese government has successfully utilized solar energy resources to overcome these issues. However, studies focusing on assessing consumers’ willingness to utilize solar energy are scarce in the country. This study aims to address this research gap by analyzing the influence of factors on consumers’ willingness to utilize solar energy for household purposes. Combined with the existing consumers’ intention factors, the study has also contributed by augmenting the theoretical mechanism of the Theory of Planned Behavior by including three novel factors (perception about self-effectiveness, belief of solar energy benefits, and perception of neighbors’ participation) to comprehensively analyze the willingness of Chinese consumers. Analysis is performed on questionnaire data of 355 households in the four largest cities of Hunan province, such as Changsha, Hengyang, Yueyang, and Zhuzhou, by accompanying an inclusive survey. Structural Equation Modeling has been employed to evaluate and scrutinize the formulated suppositions. The findings disclose that the intention factors, i.e., perception about self-effectiveness, environmental concern, awareness of solar energy, and belief of solar energy benefits impart positive effects on consumers’ willingness to utilize solar energy, while, cost of solar energy has a negative effect. Notably, perception of neighbors’ participation has an insignificant effect. Research outcomes emphasize transforming social norms, raise consumers’ awareness, redesign policy frameworks, and highlight the paybacks that solar energy offers by integrative and consistent efforts. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","China; Consumers; Solar energy; Structural equation modeling; Theory of planned behavior","Climate change; Consumer behavior; Fossil fuels; Surveys; Sustainable development; Chinese Government; Environmental concerns; Policy framework; Questionnaire data; Research outcome; Structural equation modeling; Sustainable growth; Theory of Planned Behavior; Solar energy","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85099793945"

This study explores how consumers’ perceptions towards green products, consumers and consumption practices (termed green perceptions) contribute to our understanding of the discrepancy between green attitudes and behaviour. This study identified several barriers to ethical consumption behaviour within a green consumption context. Three key themes emerged from the study, ‘it is too hard to be green’, ‘green stigma’ and ‘green reservations’. There is currently a perception, based on a number of factors, that it is too hard to be green, which creates a barrier to purchasing green products. Furthermore, some consumers were reluctant or resistant to participate in green consumption practices due to their unfavourable perceptions of green consumers and green messages. This article suggests that green perceptions may influence consumers’ intention to purchase green products. Accordingly, it discusses the implications, and suggests avenues for future research. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Environmentally conscious behaviour; Green attitude–behaviour gap; Green perceptions; Theory of planned behaviour","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84949316453"

Surprisingly, only limited research in marketing has investigated this topic. The purpose of this paper is to provide a strategic analysis of an actual consumer protest with implications for better managerial decisions. Design/methodology/approach - The animosity model of consumer purchase behavior was employed in two longitudinal studies to investigate an ongoing marketplace protest - Australian consumers' boycott of French products. Study 1 was carried out while France was engaged in nuclear testing in the South Pacific. Study 2 was carried out 1 year after the resolution of the conflict. Findings - Results from Study 1 show that Australian consumers' animosity toward France was negatively related to their willingness to purchase French products. Consistent with a key prediction from the animosity model, this effect was independent of evaluations of French product quality. The findings from Study 2 show that, a year after the cessation of nuclear testing, Australian consumers continue to have strong negative affect toward France, which in turn, had negative marketplace consequences for French products. Originality/value - While the results from Study 1 show that consumer anger over nuclear testing did not necessarily lead to the denigration of the quality of French goods, the second study indicates that, beyond the duration of the official protest, there may be repercussions for products associated with the offending party. Accordingly, managers should consider implementing communications programs which, over time, effectively reinforce the quality of their products in the minds of protesting consumers. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Brands; Consumer behaviour; International business","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-18244386950"

[Gallego, G., G. Iyengar, R. Phillips, A. Dubey. 2004. Managing flexible products on a network. CORC Technical Report TR-2004-01, Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research, Columbia University, New York.] recently proposed a choice-based deterministic linear programming model (CDLP) for network revenue management (RM) that parallels the widely used deterministic linear programming (DLP) model. While they focused on analyzing ""flexible products"" - a situation in which the provider has the flexibility of using a collection of products (e.g., different flight times and/or itineraries) to serve the same market demand (e.g., an origin-destination connection)-their approach has broader implications for understanding choice-based RM on a network. In this paper, we explore the implications in detail. Specifically, we characterize optimal offer sets (sets of available network products) by extending to the network case a notion of ""efficiency"" developed by Talluri and van Ryzin [Talluri, K. T., G. J. van Ryzin. 2004. Revenue management under a general discrete choice model of consumer behavior. Management Sci. 50 15-33.] for the single-leg, choice-based RM problem. We show that, asymptotically, as demand and capacity are scaled up, only these efficient sets are used in an optimal policy. This analysis suggests that efficiency is a potentially useful approach for identifying ""good"" offer sets on networks, as it is in the case of single-leg problems. Second, we propose a practical decomposition heuristic for converting the static CDLP solution into a dynamic control policy. The heuristic is quite similar to the familiar displacement-adjusted virtual nesting (DAVN) approximation used in traditional network RM, and it significantly improves on the performance of the static LP solution. We illustrate the heuristic on several numerical examples. © 2008 INFORMS.","Choice behavior; Dynamic programming; Linear programming; Multinomial logit choice model; Network revenue management","Dynamic programming; Engineering research; Heuristic methods; Linear programming; Linearization; Management; Optimization; Particle size analysis; Systems engineering; Wireless telecommunication systems; Choice behavior; Columbia universities; Consumer behaviors; Discrete choice models; Dynamic control policies; Efficient sets; Flexible products; Flight time; Linear programming models; Market demands; Multinomial logit choice model; Network products; Network revenue management; New york; Numerical examples; Optimal policies; Origin destinations; Phillips; Network management","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-61349175246"

Consumer behavior should therefore be of central interest to a broad range of psychologists. These patterns include much of what is commonly understood as free will. Our approach to understanding free will sidesteps metaphysical and theological debates. Belief in free will is pervasive in human social life and contributes to its benefits. Evolution endowed humans with a new form of action control, which is what people understand by free will. Its complexity and flexibility are suited to the distinctively human forms of social life in culture, with its abstract rules, expanded time span, diverse interdependent roles, and other sources of opportunities and constraints. Self-control, planful action, and rational choice are vital forms of free will in this sense. The capacity for self-control and intelligent decision making involves a common, limited resource that uses the body's basic energy supply. When this resource is depleted, self-control fails and decision making is impaired. © 2007 Society for Consumer Psychology.","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-44249113564"

Relying on social identity theory and reciprocal action theory, we develop a framework that explores the process of how a firm's online community enhances consumers' brand commitment. We empirically examine how online communities influence brand commitment and subsequent customer behaviour in a field study of over 1,500 members of an existing online community for herbal products. In our analysis, we confirm that online community commitment is a key influence on brand commitment. We also find that online community participants possess stronger brand commitment than consumers who are not members of the community.

We present a model of demand cannibalization and a behavioral study that estimates a key modeling parameter: a fraction of consumers who switch from new to remanufactured product. As we show, this fraction has an inverted-U shape, and, thus, the underlying consumer behavior cannot be modeled using the standard methodologies that rely on consumers' willingness to pay (WTP). We find that by incorporating the inverted-U-shaped consumer behavior, the firm remanufactures under broader conditions, charges a much lower price, and typically remanufactures more units-leading to an increase of profits from remanufacturing by up to a factor of two as compared with making decisions based on the WTP only. Lastly, we find that the behavior of the low-price market segment plays an important role because the firm reacts to it differently than the WTP-based logic would suggest. © 2011 Production and Operations Management Society.","behavioral operations; demand cannibalization; environmental sustainability; remanufacturing; revenue management","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-81355133593"

The study shows that UK competitors achieved a remarkable growth of their international students’ enrolment while the UK achieves only a marginal growth with declining market penetration abroad. The findings confirmed the central importance of pricing, product and promotional variables in designing and marketing UK education abroad. © 2003, MCB UP Limited","Consumer behaviour; Higher education; International marketing; Marketing intelligence; Students; United Kingdom","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84986121868"

When consumers in opinion polls are asked if their purchasing decisions would be influenced by information on environmental or ethical aspects of products, the majority seem very ready to say yes. However, evidence for actual behavior along these lines is still limited. In this paper a mixed logit model is used to quantify the effect of a certified environmental label (the Nordic Swan) on consumers' brand choices of toilet paper, paper towels and detergents, using a large Danish consumer panel with detailed information on actual purchases from the beginning of 1997 to January 2001. It is found that the Nordic Swan label has had a significant effect on consumers' brand choices for toilet paper, corresponding to a marginal willingness to pay for the certified environmental label of 13-18% of the price and it also appears that information on environmental performance has had an effect on consumers' choice of detergent. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

The relationship between the emotion experienced by senders and receivers was found to be mediated by receivers mimicking smiling on the part of senders. Exposing receivers to happy senders they liked also resulted in receivers having a positive attitudinal bias toward a product. The happiness experienced by receivers via contagion was found to mediate the effects of sender emotion and receiver liking of the sender on receiver product attitudes. The second experiment replicated the first while demonstrating that observation of the facial expressions of senders by receivers, thus allowing mimicking of smiling, was a necessary condition for emotional contagion to occur.

The research model is empirically tested with data collected from 369 participants in China. Results indicate that the EV purchase intention can be explained 57.1% variance by consumer perception and personality. Two types of personality, such as personal innovativeness and environmental concern, significantly affect EV purchase intention directly. They are also significantly mediated by two kinds of perceptions (i.e. positive and negative utilities).

Specifically, the study investigates the influence of two consumer-brand relational constructs, brand trust and brand identification, on brand evangelism. Brand evangelism, conceptualized as an amalgam of adoption and advocacy behaviors, is operationalized in terms of three supportive behaviors: purchase intentions, positive referrals, and oppositional brand referrals. Design/methodology/approach: Drawing from prior research on consumer-brand relationships, a framework of brand relationships and brand evangelism is developed. To provide a more robust test of theory, consumers' extraversion, gender, and brand experience are included as control variables. Structural equation modeling is used to test the proposed hypotheses. Findings: The findings reveal that consumer-brand relationships influence brand evangelism, albeit in different ways. Whereas brand trust influences purchase intentions and positive referrals, brand identification influences positive and oppositional brand referrals. Overall, the findings reveal the power of consumer-brand relationships in engendering brand evangelism, relative to other factors such as extraversion, gender, and brand experience. Practical implications: In today's consumption society, where it is increasingly easier for consumers to demonstrate extreme devotion and derision toward brands, it is important for marketers to understand the drivers of behaviors directed toward brands. This study suggests that marketers can cultivate brand evangelism by building brand trust and brand identification. Originality/value: Marketing researchers and practitioners are only recently beginning to understand brand evangelism. This study demonstrates that consumer-brand relationships, rather than personality, gender, and usage experience, trigger brand evangelism and offers directions for future researchers to further explicate brand evangelism. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Brand evangelism; Brand identification; Brand trust; Consumer-brand relationships","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84888986992"

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to, in an exploratory manner, examine the impact of a number of pro-social, financial performance, and socio-demographic variables on SRI behavior in order to explain why investors choose to invest different proportions of their investment portfolio in SRI profiled funds. An ordinal logistic regression analysis on 528 private investors revealed that two of the three pro-social variables had a positive impact on how much the consumer invested in SRI profiled funds. Moreover, there was proof of a non-altruistic motive for investing in SRI as consumers who perceive that financial return of SRI is equal or better than ""regular"" mutual funds, invested a greater proportion of their portfolio in SRI profiled mutual funds. Furthermore, the results showed that women and better-educated investors were more likely to invest a greater proportion of their investment portfolio in SRI. Overall, the findings indicate that both financial perceptions and pro-social attitudes are connected to consumer investment in SRI. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Consumer investment behavior; Mutual funds; Private investors; Pro-social attitudes; Socially responsible investment","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-55349099895"

According to lead-user theory, these users are defined as being ahead of an important market trend and experiencing high benefits from innovating. The present article extends lead-user theory by exploring the antecedents and consequences of consumers' lead userness in the course of three studies on extreme sports communities. Regarding antecedents, it uncovers that field-related variables (consumer knowledge and use experience) as well as field-independent personality variables (locus of control and innovativeness) help explain an individual's lead userness. These variables might therefore be used as a proxy to identify the rare species of lead users. With regard to consequences, it uncovers that lead users demonstrate innovative behavior not only by creating new product ideas but also by adopting new commercial products more heavily and faster than ordinary users. This highlights the idea that lead users might not only be valuable to idea-generation processes for radically new concepts; instead, they might also be relevant to more general issues in the marketing of new products. © 2008 Product Development & Management Association.","","Knowledge engineering; Product design; Product development; Professional aspects; Sustainable development; Field-related variables; Lead-user theory; User innovations; Customer satisfaction","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-44149122864"

This is mainly because of the growth of social networking sites, which has also developed e-commerce. The current development in e-commerce opened a new stream, entitled social commerce, which is using social technologies to create an environment for generating social interactions. These social interactions can drive online social support in e-commerce, which in turn is creating trust and an increased intention to use social commerce. This research used social support theory and related theories on intention to use to propose a theoretical framework for the adoption of social commerce. The model predicts that forums and communities, ratings, reviews, referrals and recommendations are helping to introduce new business plans for e-vendors. The model also shows trust is an on-going issue in e-commerce and can be built through social commerce constructs. There is limited research in the area of social commerce which this study seeks to redress. This study proposes a new model which can be extended by other constructs. However, the research needs to empirically test the constructs of the proposed model and their relationship. This paper introduces social commerce constructs, namely; recommendations and referrals, forums and communities and rating and reviews. The bases of the model proposed in this research are IT adoption and literature in the area such as PU and intention to buy or trust. These highlight the key role of ICT in the behaviour of online customers. This can be a development for e-commerce adoption models and the results signify that IS has a reference discipline for the behaviour of online consumers. This is an issue in marketing where not enough attention is paid to the importance of IT and IS. © 2013, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

As base model, we use the technology acceptance model (TAM) and theory of planned behavior (TPB). The model employs security and privacy, self efficacy, government support, and technology support, in addition to perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, attitude, social norm, perceived behavior control and intention to use Internet banking. Structural equation modeling is employed to examine the inter-correlations among the proposed constructs. A survey involving a total of 284 respondents is conducted and confirmatory factor analysis was used to determine the measurement efficacies. Theoretically, this study confirms the applicability of the TAM model and TPB in predicting Internet banking adoption by Tunisian bank customers. The results allow banks' decision makers to develop strategies that can encourage the adoption of Internet banking. Banks should improve the security and privacy to protect consumers' personal and financial information, which will increase the trust of users.

For both consumers and companies, these crises have become of increasing importance because of the globalization of markets and an increased coverage by the media. Marketers need to understand why and how consumers react to a crisis. We show that by decoupling risk response behavior of consumers into the separate components of risk perception and risk attitude, a more robust conceptualization and prediction of consumers' reactions is possible. Such a framework helps provide answers on how marketers can deal with such types of crises. The merits of this conceptualization are illustrated in two field studies that examine the reactions of German, Dutch, and American consumers to the BSE (mad cow disease) crisis. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

We present the example of Velix, a web portal designed to motivate customers of a utility company to reduce their electricity consumption. In particular, we consider the effectiveness of goal setting functionality and defaults in influencing energy conservation behavior. For this purpose, we use the web portal as a test of the theoretical propositions underlying its design. Based on data collected from a field experiment with 1,791 electricity consumers, we test hypotheses regarding the structural relations between defaults and goals, the impact of defaults and goals on consumption behavior, and the moderating role of feedback on goal choice. Our results confirm the positive impact of goal setting on energy conservation. We show that default goals lead to statistically significant savings by affecting goal choice. However, if the default goals are set too low or too high with respect to a self-set goal, the defaults will detrimentally affect behavior. We also show that feedback on goal attainment moderates the effect of default goals on goal choice. The results extend the knowledge on goal setting and defaults and have implications for the design of effective energy feedback systems. The study's approach, which combines hypothesis-driven work and design-oriented IS research, could serve as a blueprint for further research endeavors of this kind, particularly with regard to feedback systems based on future smart metering infrastructures.","Consumption feedback; Defaults; Design research; Energy conservation; Field experiment; Goal setting; Green IS","Consumer behavior; Electric power utilization; Energy conservation; Portals; Web crawler; Websites; Defaults; Design research; Field experiment; Goal setting; Green is; Energy efficiency","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84887468492"

A recent revival of interest in product life spans has taken place in the context of increasing waste generation and debate prompted by proposed producer responsibility legislation, but data on the age of discarded products and consumer attitudes to product life spans have been lacking. This paper draws upon recent data from research into discarded household appliances in the UK to enhance a theoretical model of product obsolescence and explore some implications for marketing and public policy. A survey of over 800 households provided quantitative data on consumer attitudes and behaviour relating to appliance life spans and a subsequent series of focus groups enriched this data with personal narratives. Respondents were evenly divided on whether or not appliance life spans are adequate. Variations in behaviour demonstrated how users may influence appliance life spans. Overall, the results suggest that consumers have an important role in reversing the trend toward increased appliance waste but currently face economic disincentives and lack adequate product information. © 2004, Kluwer Academic Publishers.","Economic Policy; Focus Group; Life Span; Marketing; Public Policy","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-21244436348"

We quantify the price effects in consumer reviews for different formats of review systems using actual market prices and on-line consumer ratings data collected for the digital camera market. Our empirical results suggest that unidimensional ratings, commonly used in most review systems, can be substantially biased by price effects. In fact, unidimensional ratings are more closely correlated with ratings of product value than ratings of product quality.

But, after browsing at the store, consumers have the option of switching to an e-tailer to purchase the item at a cheaper price rather than buying at the store. Recent business press refers to this browse-and-switch behavior as ""showrooming,"" and attributes to it the declining profits of brick-and-mortar retailers. To study the effect of the browse-and-switch option on retail and online pricing strategies and profits, we analyze a stylized economic model that incorporates uncertainty in consumers' valuation of the product, captures the heterogeneity among consumers in their inclination to purchase online, and permits product returns. We consider various equilibrium scenarios for different combinations of consumer shopping behaviors, characterize the parameter ranges for each scenario, and demonstrate that browse-and-switch behavior can indeed occur under equilibrium. Our analysis further shows that the option for consumers to browse-and-switch intensifies competition, reducing the profits for both firms. © 2013 Production and Operations Management Society.","channel switching; multi-channel competition; retail pricing; showrooming","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84904723195"

Design/methodology/approach - A survey instrument was used to gather data to test the relationships shown in the research model. Data were collected from a sample of online questionnaires filled out by subscribers located in three discussion-mailing lists - administered by RedIris - about different topics (e.g. experimental sciences, social sciences and humanities). A structural equation modeling (SEM), specifically partial least squares (PLS), is proposed to assess the relationships between the constructs together with the predictive power of the research model. Findings - The empirical development suggests that there is scope for further extension of TAM to adapt to the web-based usage and its profitable consequences. The article may help to further the empirical research and to clarify and examine a web acceptance and usage model. In general, experiential and goal-directed behaviours moderate the key relationships in the model. Experiential and goal-directed users do not weigh extrinsic and intrinsic motives in the same way when on the web. Goal-directed users are more driven by instrumental factors and focused on their decision-making process while experiential users are more motivated by process.. Research limitations/ implications - First, constructs of enjoyment and concentration are used to define flow. However, because of the flow definition's conceptual-vagueness, operationalising the flow construct has been questioned in the previous empirical works. Second, the cross-sectional study is also an important limitation. Since the users' perception and intention can change over time, it is important to measure these quantities at several points of time. Third, the sample sizes are relatively small. Fourth, the model needs to be tested with more objective measures to compare possible divergences. Finally, the model clearly does not include all the relevant variables. Practical implications - The results could be used to explain and to improve the experiential and goal-directed users' experience of being and to return to the web. Originality/value - The value of this study is to reveal the moderating influences of browsing-modes on relationship between flow and TAM-beliefs on the web, and, also, how the flow impacts the attitude and intention to use web between experiential and goal-directed users. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Consumer behaviour; Individual behaviour; Online operations; User interfaces; User studies; Worldwide web","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-18844460670"

This study investigates the impact of environmental responsibility on green consumption via the mediation of environmental concern and the moderation of price sensitivity. The questionnaire survey method was used to collect data from 680 Chinese consumers via an online questionnaire. The empirical results reveal that environmental responsibility can promote environmental concern and enhance green consumption. Specifically, environmental responsibility has a positive impact on environmental concern and also has different positive effects on green consumption intention. Environmental concern positively affects green consumption intention and plays a partial mediation role in the relationship between environmental responsibility and green consumption intention. Price sensitivity plays a negative moderation role in the relationship among environmental responsibility, environmental concern and green consumption intention.

We adopt a qualitative approach to guide the development of grounded theory across multiple levels of analysis, including the industry (consisting of multiple actors), organizational, and individual creator levels. Our study shows that business and production interests currently drive the rationalization of video game production. There is a maturing trend, with product designs becoming well established as genres, and consumers and publishers desiring incrementally innovative games. This leads publishers to focus on acquiring intellectual property, and publishers and studios alike to make incrementally innovative sequels. The increasing complexity of products leads to further rationalization in their development. However, the need to satisfy consumers' continually evolving tastes and game developers' inclinations to be creative also creates tensions with these rational forces. Different actors balance these tensions differently. Studios may seek to balance these by shifting between more and less innovative products, by creating original intellectual property to increase their bargaining power with publishers, and by iterating and repositioning products during development to adapt them to the market. Publishers may enhance their portfolio by hiring highly creative designers into their stable. New products are created through combinative creativity, that is, the recombination of existing ideas from different sources into new products. The connection of combinative mechanisms with the balancing behavior at the firm level provides a means for understanding the evolution of innovative products and, therefore, industries. © 2007 INFORMS.","Combinative innovation; Creative industries; Creativity; Industry evolution; Video game","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-61349124938"

Based on a large scale survey that included statistically viable numbers of male as well as female respondents, the study finds a great deal of consensus regarding shopping responsibility among the sampled households. Although men are playing a significant role in shopping activities, particularly shopping for household groceries, shopping remains a gendered activity but it is not a pleasureless activity.

Yet, even though consumers are ethically concerned, they rarely transform their intentions into a green purchasing behaviour—and this phenomenon is also evident in the sustainable fashion industry. This study aims to understand the prevailing attitude-behaviour gap and explores the barriers that constrain consumers in purchasing green apparel. A total of 13 in-depth interviews were conducted and analysed to the principles of grounded theory. The analysis reveals that the following barriers impede consumption of sustainable fashion: price, availability, knowledge, transparency, image, inertia and consumption habits. The impact of each dimension on consumers' purchase decisions might be of interest to apparel manufacturers and retailers who should implement strategies to encourage eco-conscious apparel acquisition and focus on diminishing these barriers. Accordingly, three major recommendations are made: (a) to concentrate on specific product attributes; (b) to adopt an efficient digital communication strategy; and (c) to make a greater effort on making green apparel attainable.

Increased demand for counterfeit branded products (CBPs) makes the study of determinants of consumers CBPs purchase behaviour more worthwhile than ever before. Existing studies have largely neglected brand influence on consumer purchase behaviour of CBPs. This research seeks to examine the impact of perceived brand image, direct and indirect effects (mediator and moderator effects) of product involvement and product knowledge on consumer purchase intention of counterfeits in the context of non-deceptive counterfeiting. Design/methodology/approach - The current study tests the conceptual model and hypotheses developed based on the existing literature. Four focus groups (ranging from six to eight participants in each group) are used to construct the research instrument. The conceptual model and hypothesis are tested using hierarchical regression analyses with survey data from 321 consumers in the UK. Findings - This research is the first in the literature on counterfeits to establish that perceived brand personality plays a more dominant role in explaining consumers' purchase intention of CBP than other influential factors (e.g. benefit and product attribute). Involvement/knowledge has no significant influence on counterfeit purchase intention. Evidence of involvement as a moderator does not exist. Brand image is not a mediator of the effects of involvement/knowledge on purchase intention. Research limitations/implications: This research only investigates one brand of one product category (watches) in the context of non-deceptive counterfeiting, although this has not prevented the emergence of significant results. Practical implications - The results of this study hold important implications for both practitioners and academics. They help to alert practitioners to the factors that truly affect consumer proneness of CBPs, for example, brand personality. For academics, they demonstrate that brand influence should not be further ignored in the study of consumer behaviour in relation to CBPs. Originality/value - This research is one of the few which investigate CBP not only as a product but, more importantly, also as a brand - a counterfeit brand. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Brand image; Consumer behaviour; Counterfeiting; United Kingdom","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-79551469292"

The study findings indicate that perceived risk of the backpackers' experience is a multidimensional phenomenon, which includes factors of risk similar to those mentioned in both the consumer behavior literature and in studies on perceived risk in tourism. This finding supports the thesis that backpacking is becoming more institutionalized and less distinct from conventional mass tourism. In addition, the study reveals that perceptions of risk involved in the backpacking experience vary across the individual's characteristics, such as gender, past backpacking experience, and preference for fellow travelers. This is congruent with the contemporary notion of backpacking as a heterogeneous tourist experience. © SAGE Publications, Inc. 2007.","Backpacking experience; Israeli backpackers; Perceived risk; Risk-taking propensity; Youth traveling","risk perception; student; tourism","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-35348906039"

However, prior research offers little insight into what WOM really means. The present study aims to investigate the complexities of the WOM concept and simultaneously examine the triggers that motivate people to offer WOM and the conditions that enhance the chance of WOM occurring. Design/methodology/approach: A series of six focus groups were undertaken with consumers, these were supplemented by more than 100 critical incident questionnaires. Findings: Two key WOM themes, termed ""richness of message"" and ""strength of implied or explicit advocacy"", were identified, as well as various triggers and conditions that affect WOM occurrence. Research limitations/implications - The study was based on two kinds of qualitative research, but quantitative research is required to fully test the derived WOM model. Further, the study focused on WOM from a giver's point of view. Research into WOM from a receiver's viewpoint is also needed. Practical implications: The present study suggested that WOM activity is more complex than previous research has argued. Managers should consider various WOM facets and, in particular, recognize WOM will be most favorable when it is positive, richly described and conveyed in a strong manner. Originality/value: The paper developed a WOM model that incorporates these additional themes and provides a basis for future quantitative research into WOM. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Communications; Competitive strategy; Consumer behaviour; Marketing strategy","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-35548985348"

Across three experiments, decision makers increasingly use a choice strategy that maximizes quality at the expense of some currency (usually price) when the quality attribute is rated as more inherently emotion-laden (Experiment 1) or involves losses rather than gains (Experiments 2 and 3). These emotional trade-off difficulty effects on choice are obtained even after controlling for effects that are attributable to subjects' relative importance weights for the quality versus currency attributes. A fourth experiment validates that tasks requiring losses (versus gains) on quality attributes are assessed as particularly emotion-laden by naïve subjects. Overall, it appears that coping with potentially emotion-laden choice trade-offs is one factor influencing consumer choice strategies. Thus, emotional trade-off difficulty is a factor that marketers should consider when attempting to predict and explain consumer choice patterns. These conclusions are consistent with recent research that argues that avoiding or otherwise coping with negative emotion is an important goal that guides decision behavior (e.g., Larrick 1993; Luce, Bettman, and Payne 1997; Simonson 1992).","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0033247745"

At the same time, there has been increased academic and professional interest in the wine consumption behavior and attitudes of so-called Millennials (individuals aged between 18 and 35). Indeed, this generation has grown up in a period where new wine attributes (i.e. beyond origin, price and brand) have gained great importance, specifically those concerning environmental, ethical and social issues associated with conventional production practices. Nevertheless, Millennial consumer preferences and purchase decisions of sustainable wines have not been truly investigated. Based on a survey of 500 Italian respondents, we assessed Millennial consumer interest and willingness to buy three wines with specific labels certifying environmental, social and ethical attributes, namely a carbon neutral wine, wine produced on land confiscated from a criminal organization, and wine that devolves money to African institutions that combat AIDS. Our findings reveal that the label related to social features (Libera Terra) obtains the highest patronage rate (almost 75% of respondents). Applying a probit model, estimates show that living in an urban area, being female and older (age cohort 27-35) significantly increases the probability of buying sustainable wines. The results are particularly useful for marketers and entrepreneurs since studies that compare different sustainability aspects of wine are particularly scant and no research has yet focused on Italian Millennials. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Most organic food on both markets is produced and processed by large-scale industrialised units and distributed through mainstream sales channels, consumer confidence being sustained at present by organic labelling schemes that appear to function well. However, a parallel market, based on the supply of goods through various direct sales channels to heavy users, prevails. We find that organic food purchase decisions are primarily motivated by 'private good' attributes such as freshness, taste and health benefits, attributes that may be perceived as being compatible with modern production and sales structure.

In this paper, we investigate the market implication of product differentiation when customers are concerned about environmental aspects of the good. We use the spatial duopoly model to determine how environmental concern affects prices, product characteristics and market shares of the competing firms. Our analysis is based on a two-stage game, where at the first stage each firm chooses the characteristic of its product. At the second stage, each firm chooses its price. Equilibrium prices and market shares are affected by consumer awareness of the environment and by the higher costs for producing those goods. As for the Nash equilibria in the characteristics, we find three equilibria depending on the parameter constellation. In order to find out whether the market functions in an optimal way, we determine the choice of environmental characteristics by a welfare maximizing authority.

Yet they assuredly occur. We take an economic and psychological approach to the study of boycotts. Our approach is to develop a typology of motivations for consumer boycotts, to embed these motivations explicitly in a dynamic economic model, and thus to offer explanations for the extent of boycott participation.","Boycott; Consumer Protests; Free Riding","Behavioral research; Economic and social effects; Marketing; Motivation; Societies and institutions; Boycott; Consumer protests; Management science","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0142095175"

Now, in Cyberspace, consumers are taking the initiative and adopting alter egos that are anything but under wraps. These online personae, called avatars, range from simple but personalized cartoonlike characters used as pictorial signatures in instant messaging to fully developed characters in virtual worlds. And they represent a huge population of ""shadow"" customers who can be analyzed, segmented, and targeted. The experience of living through another self is most powerful in so-called massively multiplayer online role-playing games, which enable thousands of people to interact simultaneously within the same three-dimensional virtual world. In such settings, participants effectively become the avatars they've created, looking out through their eyes and engaging with other such beings. In this article, which expands upon an item in ""The HBR List: Breakthrough Ideas for 2006"" (HBR February 2006), the author examines early efforts to market real-world products in virtual worlds. He argues that companies need to quickly look beyond the market itself and think about the potential customer, which may be the avatar rather than its creator. Of course, the human behind the avatar controls the money in the real-world wallet. But the avatar, as a distinct creation of the user's psyche, can influence its creator's purchasing behavior and even make its own purchases of realworld products in the virtual world, deliverable to the user's real-world door. At the least, avatars offer a window into people's hidden preferences and a means for achieving sustained consumer engagement with a brand. The marketing initiatives of the few pathfinding companies working in this area point toward some methods that might be used in the future.","","","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-33744828246"

These projects usually deal with complex, societally relevant, real-world problems. This paper focuses on TdR projects, which integrate the knowledge of researchers and stakeholders in a collaborative transdisciplinary process through structured methods of mutual learning. Previous research on the evaluation of TdR has insufficiently explored the intended effects of transdisciplinary processes on the real world (societal effects). We developed an evaluation framework for assessing the societal effects of transdisciplinary processes. Outputs (measured as procedural and product-related involvement of the stakeholders), impacts (intermediate effects connecting outputs and outcomes) and outcomes (enhanced decision making capacity) are distinguished as three types of societal effects. Our model links outputs and outcomes of transdisciplinary processes via the impacts using a mediating variables approach. We applied this model in an ex post evaluation of a transdisciplinary process. 84 out of 188 agents participated in a survey. The results show significant mediation effects of the two impacts ""network building"" and ""transformation knowledge"". These results indicate an influence of a transdisciplinary process on the decision making capacity of stakeholders, especially through social network building and the generation of knowledge relevant for action. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Design/methodology/approach: Following a qualitative preliminary study and a literature review, six factors are identified as possible determinants of a preference for non-ownership modes of consumption. These are examined in a quantitative study using a sample of 461 members of a German online peer-to-peer sharing network. Hypotheses regarding the proposed determinants are tested using factor analysis and structural equation modelling. Findings: The results show that the demand for non-ownership services is negatively influenced by ""possession importance"" (the importance that a consumer attaches to full ownership) and positively influenced by ""trend orientation"" and ""convenience orientation"". The other proposed determinants - ""experience orientation"", ""price consciousness"", and ""environmentalism"" do not appear to influence a preference for non-ownership modes of consumption. Practical implications: Although the renting of goods is an increasingly popular form of consumption, consumers still value ownership. Suppliers should therefore consider offering a mixture of ""ownership"" and ""non-ownership"" modes of consumption to their customers. Originality/value: This study complements existing research in this area, which has largely been conceptual in nature, by undertaking an empirical evaluation of the importance of several proposed determinants for non-ownership preference. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Consumer behaviour; Consumer goods; Germany; Internet; Retailing","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-77949326628"

The research suffers from a lack of agreement over the operationalization of the construct of the brand loyalty. Many researchers [e.g., Kahn, B.E., Kalwani, M.U., Morrison, D.G., 1986. Measuring variety seeking and reinforcement behaviors using panel data. Journal of Marketing Research 23, 89-100; Ehrenberg, A.S.C., Goodhardt, G.J., Barwise, P.B., 1990. Double jeopardy revisited. Journal of Marketing 54, 82-91] have defined brand loyalty only from a behavioral perspective. They assumed that repeat purchasing can capture the loyalty of a consumer towards the brand of interest. Other researchers [e.g., Day, G.S., 1969. A two-dimensional concept of brand loyalty. Journal of Advertising Research 9, 29-35; Dick, A.S., Basu, K., 1994. Consumer loyalty: towards an integrated conceptual approach. Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science 22 (2), 99-113; Baldinger, A.L., Rubinson, J., 1996. Brand loyalty: the link between attitude and behavior. Journal of Advertising Research 36 (6), 22-34; Rundle-Thiele, S.R., Bennett, R., 2001. A brand for all seasons: A discussion of loyalty approaches and their applicability for different markets. Journal of Product and Brand Management 10 (1), 25-37; Rundle-Thiele, S.R., 2005. Elaborating customer loyalty: exploring loyalty to wine retailers. Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services 12 (5), 333-344], however, have suggested that attitude should be included along with behavior to define loyalty. In particular, Dick and Basu (1994) were precise in suggesting that a favorable attitude and repeat purchase were required to define loyalty. By viewing loyalty as an attitude-behavior relationship in their framework, Dick and Basu (1994) were able to investigate the concept from a causal perspective thereby permitting the identification of the factors that influence loyalty. Our research extends the idea proposed by Dick and Basu (1994) in two ways. First, we provide a conceptually clear, and an operationally meaningful way of segmenting the market on the basis of attitudes that govern this behavior. To be specific, we offer a unique way to measure attitudinal loyalty. And we use a unique survey data with a large sample of 1800 respondents that includes both behavioral (purchase) patterns and attitudes of the respondents for all major brands of toothpaste, to demonstrate that behavioral loyalty is influenced by attitudinal loyalty across many brands of the toothpaste category. Finally, we propose that a third behavioral pattern-non-user-should be also included along with two known behavioral patterns viz. single user and multiple user. This is because a non-user has the potential to become a consumer in future. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

In this project, a different set of lenses is adopted to examine customer orientation from the customer’s point of view. Customers can enact four specific roles that enable them to create a partnership with human services firms. Customers can be important resources for the firm. They can actively participate in the firm’s activities as co‐producers of the service. As buyers, customers can develop a relationship with a service organization, and as recipients they register evaluations of their encounter. Analysis of an extensive survey of customer perceptions and investments in a firm’s activities provided an outside‐in look at customer orientation. The results present clear evidence that customers can influence the outcomes they experience.

In products, integrity is the source of sustainable competitive advantage. Products with integrity perform superbly, provide good value, and satisfy customers' expectations in every respect, including such intangibles as their look and feel. Consider this example from the auto industry. In 1987, Mazda put a racy four-wheel steering system in a five-door family hatchback. Honda introduced a comparable system in the Prelude, a sporty, two-door coupe. Most of Honda's customers installed the new technology; Mazda's system sold poorly. Potential customers felt the fit--or misfit--between the car and the new component, and they responded accordingly. Companies that consistently develop products with integrity are coherent, integrated organizations. This internal integrity is visible at the level of strategy and structure, in management and organization, and in the skills, attitudes, and behavior of individual designers, engineers, and operators. Moreover, these companies are integrated externally: customers become part of the development organization. Integrity starts with a product concept that describes the new product from the potential customer's perspective--""pocket rocket"" for a sporty, subcompact car, for example. Whether the final product has integrity will depend on two things: how well the concept satisfies potential customers' wants and needs and how completely the concept has been embodied in the product's details. In the most successful development organizations, ""heavyweight"" product managers are responsible for leading both tasks, as well as for guiding the creation of a strong product concept.","","Consumer Satisfaction; Humans; Industry; Organizational Objectives; Planning Techniques; Product Line Management; United States; article; consumer; hospital management; human; industry; organization; organization and management; United States","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0025520172"

Structural equation modeling analysis was used to examine the hypothesized paths in the adoption of mobile shopping. Results indicated that the effect of facilitating conditions on both utilitarian and hedonic performance expectancies is stronger for consumers with a low level of technology anxiety than for consumers with a high level of technology anxiety. Moreover, consumers with a high level of technology anxiety rely more on social influence in the use of mobile shopping than consumers with a low level of technology anxiety.

Based on its feature, autonomous vehicle is expected to improve traffic flow, reduce accidents, reduce social exclusion and improve the utility of time on travel. It is increasingly accepted that the next step to the evolution of human transportation is the replacement of human as the driver by the Artificial-intelligence-capable machine. Regardless, the challenges remain especially in convincing the consumers to switch to autonomous cars despite the apparent benefits. In the past, papers highlighted individual trust toward machine as the key point to encourage acceptance of autonomous cars. This paper seeks to highlight the ethical implications of the autonomous technology and how it is related to the user acceptance of the technology. This paper reviewed recent studies on the ethical implications of the autonomous vehicle and the user acceptance of the technology. A systematic review of papers from the literature was done using Scopus, ISI and Web of Science. The results of the review have shown that the level of trust, which may vary on the sociodemographic profile of the users, has been studied as one of the factors for user acceptance. Many researchers also highlight ethical implication as an important aspect of autonomous technology that needs to be tended to. The researcher proposes that ethical implication can be an important element of user trust toward autonomous technology. Hence, there is a need to embed ethical implication as a construct for user trust leading to user acceptance model in future studies. In the line of this research review researcher was addressed the following comprehensive groups: examination of autonomous vehicle topographies and flexibility prototypes, consequences for street traffic and connectivity to substructure (specifically in the urban areas with the medium and low density), communal attitudes and apprehensions, transportable behaviour and plea, possible business models, and strategy implications.

Past research emphasizes the economic gains of consumer co-creation, with limited research focusing on the psychological effects engendered in the process of consumer brand co-creation. Drawing from self-determination theory and implicit self-esteem theory, the present research proposes an integrative framework for synthesizing the perceived psychological benefits and distinctive motivations in the brand co-creation process. The results indicated that brand self-connection and three perceived benefits of brand co-creation tasks (autonomy, competence, and relatedness) facilitate consumer motivations to participate in brand co-creation campaigns. These motivations facilitate the establishment of brand co-creation engagement, which in turn leads to strengthened brand relationship behavior. This research exemplifies that a well designed brand co-creation contest is a potent means which can not only enhance consumer engagement with the co-creation contest, but also turn engaged consumers into intangible assets for brand innovation. © 2016 Marketing EDGE.org.","Brand co-creation; Brand contest; Brand relationship; Engagement; Motivation","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84959498728"

Although this may generate incremental revenues in the short term, the long-term consequences of such a strategy are not immediately obvious: More discounted last-minute tickets may lead to more consumers anticipating the discount and delaying the purchase rather than buying at the regular (higher) prices, hence potentially reducing revenues for the company. To mitigate such behavior, many service providers have turned to opaque intermediaries, such as Hotwire.com, that hide many descriptive attributes of the service (e.g., departure times for airline tickets) so that the buyer cannot fully predict the ultimate service provider. Using a stylized economic model, this paper attempts to explain and compare the benefits of last-minute sales directly to consumers versus through an opaque intermediary. We utilize the notion of rational expectations to model consumer purchasing decisions: Consumers make early purchase decisions based on expectations regarding future availability, and these expectations are correct in equilibrium. We show that direct last-minute sales are preferred over selling through an opaque intermediary when consumer valuations for travel are high or there is little service differentiation between competing service providers, or both; otherwise, opaque selling dominates. Moreover, contrary to the usual belief that such sales are purely mechanisms for disposal of unused capacity, we show that opaque selling becomes more preferred over direct last-minute selling as the probability of having high demand increases. When firms randomize between opaque selling and last-minute selling strategies, they are increasingly likely to choose the opaque selling strategy as the probability of high demand increases. When firms with unequal capacities use the opaque selling strategy, consumers know more clearly where the opaque ticket is from and the efficacy of opaque selling decreases. © 2010 INFORMS.","Competition; Distribution channels; Rational expectations; Revenue management; Strategic consumer behavior","Air transportation; Competition; Economics; Management; Consumer behaviors; Distribution channel; Rational expectations; Revenue management; Strategic consumer behavior; Sales","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-77949562848"

Successful gamification practices are reliant on encouraging playful subjectivities so that users voluntarily expose their personal information, which is then used to drive behavioural change (e.g. weight loss, workplace productivity, educational advancement, consumer loyalty, etc.). The pleasures of play, the promise of a 'game', and the desire to level up and win are used to inculcate desirable skill sets and behaviours. Gamification is rooted in surveillance; providing real-time feedback about users' actions by amassing large quantities of data and then simplifying this data into modes that easily understandable, such as progress bars, graphs and charts. This article provides an introduction to gamification for surveillance scholars. I first provide brief definitions of gamification, games and play, linking the effectiveness of gamification to the quantification of everyday life. I then explain how the quantification in gamification is different from the quantification in both analog spaces and digital non-game spaces. Next, I draw from governmentality studies to show how quantification is leveraged in terms of surveillance. I employ three examples to demonstrate the social effects and impacts of gamified behaviour. These examples range from using self-surveillance to gamify everyday life, to the participatory surveillance evoked by social networking services, to the hierarchical surveillance of the gamified call-centre. Importantly, the call-centre example becomes a limit case, emphasizing the inability to gamify all spaces, especially those framed by work and not play. This leads to my conclusion, arguing that without knowing first what games and play are, we cannot accurately respond to and critique the playful surveillant technologies leveraged by gamification. © The author(s), 2013.","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84881287058"

We identify five factors that increase the likelihood of a disparity between revealed preferences and normative preferences: passive choice, complexity, limited personal experience, third-party marketing, and intertemporal choice. We then discuss six approaches that jointly contribute to the identification of normative preferences: structural estimation, active decisions, asymptotic choice, aggregated revealed preferences, reported preferences, and informed preferences. Each of these approaches uses consumer behavior to infer some property of normative preferences without equating revealed and normative preferences.

Design/methodology/approach: A web-based survey was undertaken where respondents completed a questionnaire about their perceptions of M-banking's ease of use, usefulness, cost, risk, compatibility with their lifestyle, and their need for interaction with personnel. Correlation and hierarchical multiple regression analysis, with Sobel tests, were used to determine whether these factors influenced consumers' attitude and intention to use M-banking. Findings: Perceived usefulness, perceived risk, cost and compatibility were found to affect consumer acceptance of M-banking. The results also support a mediation model, whereby attitude transfers the affects of the consumers' perceptions to their intention to use M-banking. Research limitations/implications: The sample used in this study contained a skew toward younger male consumers, affecting the generalisability of the results. Practical implications: Developing marketing programs that focus on creating a positive attitude toward M-banking should attract consumers to this emerging electronic banking channel. Specifically, marketers should emphasise M-banking's usefulness and compatibility with consumers' lifestyle, in addition to designing M-banking systems that minimise risk and cost to the consumer. Originality/value: This paper validates and further develops an existing attitudinal model in the M-banking context, answering the call for additional research to generalise and improve the explanatory power of self-service technology acceptance models to other groups and countries. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Australia; Banking; Consumer behaviour; Mobile communications systems","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-78049519124"

It is proposed that two conditions make moral reasoning in the buying situation more likely: environmental concern and the absence of other highly involving characteristics. The paper presents a study of a case with these two characteristics: Danish consumers' choice of environment-friendly packaging. With regard to this case, the evidence supports the claim. A majority of Danish consumers have developed personal norms about choosing environment-friendly packaging and the personal norm is a significant predictor of their (self-reported) propensity to choose environment-friendly packaging in the supermarket (whereas perceived costs have a minor influence on the choice). It is recommended that attempts to promote this and similar behaviour focus on strengthening consumers' intrinsic motivation and on facilitating its transformation into behaviour. © 2000 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0043253180"

This study aims to bridge this gap by extending the TCV to the FDA context to examine food consumption-related values and interpreting and rechristening generic consumption values to adapt the TCV to the FDA context. Design/methodology/approach: An explorative mixed-method research approach was taken to conduct focus group discussions with 20 target users to develop the questionnaire and then administer it for a cross-sectional survey (pen and pencil) to FDA users aged 22–65 years; 423 complete responses so received were analyzed using structural equation modeling. Findings: The findings show that epistemic value (“visibility”) is the chief driver of purchase intentions toward FDAs, followed by conditional (“affordances”), price (part of functional value) and social value (“prestige”). Food-safety concerns and health consciousness (proposed as part of functional value) did not share any statistically significant association with purchase intentions toward FDAs.

Businesses are under pressure not only from consumers but also from governments to use eco-friendly packaging for their products. However, what consumers perceive to be eco-friendly packaging is still unclear, especially in emerging markets. This study examines consumer perceptions of eco-friendly packaging in the context of packaged food products of Vietnam. The study involved a series of six focus group discussions conducted with a diverse range of consumers. The focus of the discussion was consumer perceptions of eco-friendly packaging, particularly whether or not consumers would adjust their purchase behaviours to be more environmentally friendly. The data analysis procedure was undertaken using inductive manual coding principles associated with interpretivist research. The results indicate that consumer perceptions of eco-friendly packaging can be categorised along three key dimensions: packaging materials, manufacturing technology and market appeal. While consumers have diverse perceptions of eco-friendly packaging, their knowledge is limited and more related to packaging materials (such as biodegradability and recyclability), and market appeal (such as attractive graphic design and good price). Consumers show little knowledge about manufacturing technologies but still desire an eco-friendly manufacturing process. Results also suggest that a consumer-defined eco-friendly package for food products should be visually appealing while satisfying consumers’ environmental expectations relating to packaging materials and manufacturing process. We therefore propose a consumer-initiated development of eco-friendly packaging that can be applied for sustainable packaging strategies. © 2019","Eco-friendly packaging; Manufacturing technology; Market appeal; Packaged food products; Packaging materials","Biodegradability; Commerce; Environmental protection; Food products; Manufacture; Packaging materials; Consumer perception; Eco-friendly; Emerging markets; Environmental consequences; Manufacturing process; Manufacturing technologies; Packaged food; Sustainable packaging; Packaging","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85076890286"

Findings - The results indicate that competence and credibility have a high explanatory power as antecedents of trust. Trust has a considerable impact on supplier selection for existing and new products, as well as on the word-of-mouth (WOM) behaviour of consumers. There are strong differences between customers and non-customers in terms of the antecedents and consequences of trust in a corporate brand. Research limitations/implications - In order to generalise the findings, the model needs to be tested with other samples and research objects. Marketing research into trust should focus on competence and credibility as important antecedents of trust. The findings propose that trust has positive effects on purchase intention and WOM behaviour. Marketing research should pay more attention to the role of trust in gaining new customers.

However, trust also seems to be a good device to gain customers from competitors.

Low fruit and vegetable consumption is itself a major nutritional problem. We aim to better quantify the gap between future fruit and vegetable supply and recommended consumption levels by exploring the interactions between supply and demand in more than 150 countries from 1961 to 2050. Methods: In this global analysis, we use the International Model for Policy Analysis of Agricultural Commodities and Trade, which simulates the global agricultural sector, to explore the role of insufficient production of fruits and vegetables and the effects of food waste and public policy in achieving recommended fruit and vegetable consumption. First, we estimate the average historical (1961–2010) and future (2010–50) national consumption levels needed to meet WHO targets (a minimum target of 400 g/person per day or age-specific recommendations of 330–600 g/person per day) using population pyramids; for future consumption, we use projections from the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs), a set of global socioeconomic scenarios characterised by varied assumptions on economic and population growth. We then simulate future fruit and vegetable production and demand to 2050 under three such scenarios (SSP1–3) to assess the potential impacts of economic, demographic, and technological change on consumer and producer behaviour. We then explore the potential effects of food waste applying various waste assumptions (0–33% waste). Finally, we apply two policy analysis frameworks (the NOURISHING framework and the Nuffield ladder) to assess the current state of public policy designed to achieve healthy diets. Findings: Historically, fruit and vegetable availability has consistently been insufficient to supply recommended consumption levels. By 2015, 81 countries representing 55% of the global population had average fruit and vegetable availability above WHO's minimum target. Under more stringent age-specific recommendations, only 40 countries representing 36% of the global population had adequate availability. Although economic growth will help to increase fruit and vegetable availability in the future, particularly in lower-income countries, this alone will be insufficient. Even under the most optimistic socioeconomic scenarios (excluding food waste), many countries fail to achieve sufficient fruit and vegetable availability to meet even the minimum recommended target. Sub-Saharan Africa is a particular region of concern, with projections suggesting, by 2050, between 0·8 and 1·9 billion people could live in countries with average fruit and vegetable availability below 400 g/person per day. Food waste is a serious obstacle that could erode projected gains. Assuming 33% waste and socioeconomic trends similar to historical patterns, the global average availability in 2050 falls below age-specific recommendations, increasing the number of people living in countries with insufficient supply of fruits and vegetables by 1·5 billion compared with a zero waste scenario. Interpretation: Increasing fruit and vegetable consumption is an important component of a shift towards healthier and more sustainable diets. Economic modelling suggests that even under optimistic socioeconomic scenarios future supply will be insufficient to achieve recommended levels in many countries. Consequently, systematic public policy targeting the constraints to producing and consuming fruits and vegetables will be needed. This will require a portfolio of interventions and investments that focus on increasing fruit and vegetable production, developing technologies and practices to reduce waste without increasing the consumer cost, and increasing existing efforts to educate consumers on healthy diets.

In part this is due to the increasing use of auction models in business and consumer markets to sell commodities, excess inventories, used merchandise, rare items collectibles, and other items. Marketers are resorting to dynamic prices even for goods and services sold at posted prices, spurred partly by the lower menu cost of changing prices on the Internet and partly as a response to consumer use of price-comparison bots. This paper explains the relevance of dynamic pricing in the digital economy by comparing the physical value chain with the virtual-information-based value chain. It explores the implications of certain aspects of dynamic pricing in consumer markets (e.g., dynamic pricing of posted prices, reverse auction pricing of goods and services as used by Priceline) from the perspective of consumer price expectations, the role of information and consumer learning, and their impact on consumer responses to prices across different product categories. Several propositions are developed, and issues for research are identified.","Dynamic pricing; Price expectations; Pricing in e-commerce; Reference prices","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0013225760"

This overall level of concern was subsequently correlated with the frequency that respondents adopted seven different online behaviors. Analysis demonstrates that the frequency of adopting five of the seven behaviors increased as respondents' privacy concern increased. Specifically, as privacy concern increased, respondents reported that they were more likely to provide incomplete information to web sites, to notify Internet Service Providers (ISPs) about unsolicited e-mail, to request removal from mailing lists, and to send a “flame” to online entities sending unsolicited e-mail. Additionally, as privacy concern increased, respondents reported that they were less likely to register for web sites requesting information.

Across three experiments, this research tests the prediction that abstract (concrete) appeal is more effective in generating green purchase intentions than concrete (abstract) appeal in situations where the benefit association of green products is other (self). Public self-awareness and identity salience moderate the effect of appeal type and benefit association on green purchase intentions. In particular, when green products associate with the benefit of other, abstract appeal is more effective, whereas both abstract and concrete appeals are less effective when green products associate with the benefit of self. This effect is moderated by public self-awareness and whether a collective level of self or an individual level of self is made salient. The results provide important managerial implications for marketers who seek to promote green consumption by suggesting that rather than merely depending on the types of advertising appeals, marketers should modify their advertising message to match the benefit association of the products and to consider the situations where public self-awareness and identity salience are present. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Advertising appeals; Benefit association; Green consumption; Identity salience; Public self-awareness","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84942369112"

This paper provides a theoretical framework for niche marketing food specialties in rural tourism by combining two different consumer behavioural theories, the “experience economy” and the “intimacy” model, representing a reorientation from classical marketing thinking. It explores the meaning of local food, including the pursuit of reconnection with nature, resilience to globalisation, the role of local food in reinforcing personal identity, the search for freshness, taste and authenticity, support for local producers, and environmental concerns. It considers the challenges for rural entrepreneurs and policy makers in marketing food specialties and rural regions to the post-modern consumer. Using examples derived mostly from secondary literature it identifies seven dimensions that elevate food products to an appealing culinary niche, namely, coherence, anti-capitalistic attitude, struggle against extinction, personal signature, mutual-disclosure, rituals of spatial and physical proximity, and sustainability-related practices. Food providers may use these features to signal food distinctiveness to rural tourists; policy makers can include them in their regional development models to enhance rural tourism without altering historically, socially, and environmentally layered culinary traditions. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","consumer behaviour; experience economy; food chains; food specialties; intimacy theory; rural tourism","consumption behavior; ecotourism; entrepreneur; marketing; policy making; regional development; rural development; theoretical study","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84943378443"

In this paper, attention is paid to the relationship between food consumption patterns and agricultural land requirements. Land requirements per food item that were determined in a previous study are combined with data on the per capita food consumption of various food packages, varying from subsistence to affluent, leading to information on land requirements for food. Large differences could be shown in per capita food consumption and related land requirements, while food consumption, expenditure, and the physical consumption of specific foods change rapidly over time. A difference of a factor of two was found between the requirements for existing European food patterns, while the land requirement for a hypothetical diet based on wheat was six times less than that for an existing affluent diet with meat. It is argued that in the near future changes in consumption patterns rather than population growth will form the most important variable for total land requirements for food. Trends towards the consumption of foods associated with affluent lifestyles will bring with them a need for more land. Lifestyle changes, changes in consumer behavior on a household level, can be considered as powerful options to reduce the use of natural resources such as agricultural land. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The realization of the two goals is related to two kinds of user behavior: item sampling and item selection. Prior research does not provide a model of attitude formation toward a personalization agent nor of how attitudes relate to these two behaviors. This limits our understanding of how web personalization can be managed to increase advertising revenues and/or sales revenues. To fill this gap, the current research develops and tests a theoretical model of user attitudes and behaviors toward a personalization agent. The model is based on an integration of two theories: the elaboration likelihood model (ELM) and consumer search theory (CST). In the integrated model, a user's attitude toward a personalization agent is influenced by both the number of items he/she has sampled so far (from CST) and the degree to which he/she cognitively processes each one (from ELM). In turn, attitude is modeled to influence both behaviors-that is, item selection and any further item sampling. We conducted a lab study and a field study to test six hypotheses. This research extends the theory on web personalization by providing a more complete picture of how sampling and processing of personalized recommendations influence a user's attitude and behavior toward the personalization agent. For online merchants, this research highlights the trade-off between item sampling and item selection and provides practical guidance on how to steer users toward the attitudes and behaviors that will realize their business goals.","Attitude confidence; Attitude persistence; Consumer search theory; Elaboration likelihood model; Web personalization","Behavioral research; Economic and social effects; Marketing; Publishing; Attitude confidence; Attitude persistence; Elaboration likelihood models; Search theory; Web personalization; Consumer behavior","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84905054284"

Drawing on social identity and self-verification theories, this research postulates that value congruence and customer-to-customer similarity drives consumer-brand identification directly and indirectly through brand attractiveness, which in turn paves the way for the development of deep relationships with brands (captured through brand loyalty and resilience to negative information). The findings show that (1) brand identification extends to both private and public consumption settings, but the respective drivers of identification markedly differ; (2) the similarity-attraction paradigm helps explain why consumers are attracted to some brands and not others; (3) identified consumers tend to ignore negative information they receive about the brand. Findings suggest that managers should identify the salient determinants for enhancing identification and create the highest possible congruence between the values of the target market and the brand. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Brand loyalty; Consumer behavior; Customer similarity; Identification; Social identity theory; Value congruence","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84955267330"

Although some research has been done in this area, the majority of work has not employed the same theoretical and methodological rigor given other areas of consumer behavior (Cunningham & Taylor, 1995). Some scholars (e.g., Gwinner, 1997; Keller, 1993) have suggested that sponsorship functions like celebrity endorser advertising, where the perceived match (or mismatch) of brand attributes with the endorser's attributes influences consumer response to such marketing communications. One of the theoretical rationales used to explain matchup effects in endorser advertising is a schema-based information processing paradigm (Lynch & Schuler, 1994; Misra & Beatty, 1990). The purpose of the current study was to examine the notion that consumers possess schemas that influence their reactions to advertising leveraging sport sponsorships. The research utilizes a 3 × 2 × 2 factorial design, where three variations of sport sponsorship print ads and two different magazine covers (sport and nonsport) are used to test the influence of brand/event matchups and advertising placement on intermediate measures of advertising effectiveness. In addition to matchup and media vehicle effects, differential response by gender is also examined. Three hypotheses are tested based on research from the literature on sponsorship, matchup effects, and advertising schemas. MANOVA results provide partial support for all three hypotheses, as matchup and media vehicle manipulations were found to significantly impact Aad. Moreover, females are found to report significantly higher Aad and Pi than did males in this study. The advertising schema framework is used to discuss the research findings. This discussion deals with the work's applied and theoretical implications and its limitations, as well as directions for future studies on sponsorship. © 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0033476158"

However, it would appear that consumers are still unclear about what it encompasses and how it relates to their individual behaviour.

The findings of the research suggest that a positive relationship was found between general and carbon-specific knowledge, attitude towards the environment, and general and carbon-specific behaviours. Therefore, general and carbon-specific environmental behaviours are related and may be driven by general attitudes and knowledge (i.e. both carbon-specific and general environmental knowledge). The implications of the study would suggest that marketers, working in tandem with government policymakers, need to focus efforts on developing consumers' knowledge about specific sub-issues, such as global warming. However, additional research needs to be undertaken to develop marketing communication that accurately reflects the environmental impact of consumption behaviour, thereby allowing for considered consumption. © 2012 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","carbon offsets; environmental knowledge; green; sustainability","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84859180647"

We use survey data from 451 German consumers to examine the relations between normative, utilitarian and hedonic motives, and purchase intentions employing structural equation modeling. The results show that normative determinants such as media reports on the economic situation are related to consumers’ purchase intentions, whereas the normative influence of close social networks is not. Furthermore, we find that hedonic motivation is a better predictor of purchase intentions than utilitarian motives and that individuals practicing social distancing, generation Z, and women show higher levels of hedonic motivation.

Mediation analyses are used to answer research questions. Findings: Financial education may affect financial satisfaction, a subjective measure of financial well-being, through financial literacy, financial behavior, and financial capability variables. Results show that subjective financial literacy, desirable financial behavior and a financial capability index (a sum of Z-scores of objective financial literacy, subjective financial literacy, desirable financial behavior, and perceived financial capability) are strong mediators between financial education and financial satisfaction. Research limitations/implications: The study has used cross sectional data that can only document associations between financial education and satisfaction and the mediators between them.

Social commerce uses friendships on social networking platforms, such as Facebook and Twitter, as the vehicle for social sharing about products or sellers to induce interest in a product, thereby increasing the purchase intention. In this paper, we develop and validate a conceptual model of how social factors, such as social support, seller uncertainty, and product uncertainty, influence users' purchasing behaviors in social commerce.

Meat-consumption frequencies provide empirical evidence for different modes of ""flexitarianism,"" including light, medium, and heavy flexitarians. In particular, the existence of heavy flexitarians suggests that the customary position of meat and other animal-based dietary products in the food hierarchy is not inviolable. To improve our understanding of meat reduction, cluster analysis adds information about differences across flexitarians. Given the enormous environmental impact of animal-protein consumption and the apparent sympathy of consumers for meat reduction, it is surprising that politicians and policy makers demonstrate little, if any, interest in strategies to reduce meat consumption and to encourage more sustainable eating practices. © 2013 Dagevos & Voordouw.","Consummatory behavior; Diets; Food consumption; Food preferences; Meat; Public policy","Animalia","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84887295315"

Thus gender, as a major social category, should influence both the products bought impulsively and the buying considerations used. We investigate these aspects of impulse buying in a mature student population through individual interviews employing a mixture of quantitative and open-ended measures. As predicted, men tend to impulsively buy instrumental and leisure items projecting independence and activity, while women tend to buy symbolic and self-expressive goods concerned with appearance and emotional aspects of self.

However, research investigating the effect of altruism on EV adoption from a pro-environmental behavior perspective is limited. To fill this gap, we propose an extended norm activation model to study the relationship between personal norms and consumers' intention to adopt EVs, and to explore how such relationship is influenced by external costs and the antecedents of personal norms. The model is empirically tested with data collected from 396 participants in China. Results show that personal norms have a positive influence on EV adoption intention, and such influence is moderated by external costs, including perceived price and perceived complexity. The former negatively moderates it, while the latter has a nonlinear moderation effect on it. Moreover, awareness of consequences, ascription of responsibility, and perceived consumer effectiveness are positive predictors to personal norms. The findings help to understand consumers' adoption behavior of EV better, and contribute to promoting EV development. © 2017","Adoption intention; Electric vehicles; Extended norm activation model; Personal norms","Automobile manufacture; Climate models; Competition; Crime; Decision making; Environmental regulations; Industrial management; Philosophical aspects; Pollution control; Public policy; Business ethics; Climate policy; Cooperategovernance; Corporate frauds; Environmental responsible investments Model (ERIs); Volkswagen; Laws and legislation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85038866445"

Prior research considering the simultaneous effects of marketing cues on consumer quality perceptions is sparse. Despite the growing importance of third-party information, research examining its simultaneous effects with marketing cues on consumers' decision making is especially absent. This research, drawing on cue-diagnosticity, cue-consistency, and negativity bias theories, proposes and tests a conceptual framework to reveal interplays among various marketing- and nonmarketing-controlled product cues. The first study examines how two- and three-way interactions of high-scope (i.e., brand reputation) and low-scope marketing cues (i.e., price and warranty) affect consumer perceptions. The second study examines a set of interaction effects between third-party quality ratings and marketing cues (i.e., price and warranty) on consumers' perceptions. Overall, the results reveal theoretical and managerial implications for processing multiple-quality cues in consumers' inference-making behaviors and suggest that consumers generally aggregate perceptions in more complex ways than suggested in the prior literature when making global product quality evaluations. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84870668561"

Yet, as this market develops, little is known about the profile of the consumer and the motivations to purchase vintage. This paper aims to explore the veracity of a number of assumptions relating to vintage consumption, equating it to the consumption of used, previously owned clothes by nostalgic prone, environmentally-friendly or value-conscious consumers. Design/methodology/approach: A quantitative approach including structural equation modeling (SEM) was employed in this research using data collected from 103 women (screened on past second-hand purchases). Vintage clothes were defined as pieces dating back from the 1920s to the 1980s. Second hand clothes were defined as modern used clothes. Findings: The results show that the main antecedents to vintage consumption are fashion involvement and nostalgia proneness as well as need for uniqueness through the mediation of treasure hunting. In contrast, second-hand consumption is directly driven by frugality. Eco-consciousness plays an indirect role through bargain hunting. In essence, the thrill of the hunt is present for vintage and for second hand consumption. Yet, while vintage consumers shop for a unique piece with history, second-hand consumers shop for a unique piece at a good price. Additionally, the main characteristics of vintage fashion consumers are a higher level of education and higher income whereas age is not directly related to the purchase of vintage pieces. Originality/value: The paper discusses the relevance of second-hand stores repositioning as vintage based on vintage and second-hand consumers' profiles. Also, the need to educate consumers on the role of second-hand consumption in a pro-environmental lifestyle is highlighted. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Buying behaviour; Clothing; Consumer behaviour; Eco-fashion; Fashion; Luxury; Nostalgia; Second-hand; Second-hand markets; Vintage; Women","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84869022907"

The theoretical literature typically models consumer search in two ways. Following Stigler's original model, a strand of literature assumes fixed sample size search behavior, where consumers sample a fixed number of stores and choose to buy the lowest priced alternative.1 A much larger strand of the literature, starting with McCall (1970) and Mortensen (1970), points out that consumers cannot commit to a fixed sample size search strategy in instances where the expected marginal benefit of an extra search exceeds the marginal cost.

The current study focuses on the most popular type of cross-channel free-riding: searching for product information in an online store and then purchasing in another brick-and-mortar store. It explores antecedents that may contribute to consumer switching behaviors through a questionnaire focused on cross-channel free-riding behavior. The empirical results reveal that when consumers perceive more multichannel self-efficacy, they engage in more cross-channel free-riding behavior. Perceived service quality of competitors' offline store and the reduced risk in the brick-and-mortar channel influence the attractiveness of this behavior and increase cross-channel free-riding intentions. By increasing within-firm lock-in levels, firms can reduce consumers' cross-channel free-riding intentions. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

However, a review of the existing flow studies in computer-mediated environments in Psychology, Consumer Behavior, Communications, Human-Computer Interaction, and Management Information Systems shows ambiguities in the conceptualization of flow constructs and inconsistency in the flow models. It thus raises the question of whether the direct adoption of traditional flow theory is appropriate without a careful reconceptualization to consider the uniqueness of the computer-mediated environments. This paper focuses on flow antecedents and identifies the importance of separating the task from the artefact within a computer-mediated environment. It proposes a component-based model that consists of person (P), artefact (A), and task (T), as well as the interactions of these components. The model, named the PAT model, is developed by understanding the original flow theory, reviewing existing empirical flow studies within computer-mediated environments, and analysing the characteristics of computer-mediated environments.

This research explores the drivers of non-users’ willingness to use ride-sharing services from the perspectives of perceived value and perceived risk, where perceived value and perceived risk are both conceptualised as formative second-order constructs constituted by their first-order value components and risk components. The data was collected in China through an online questionnaire from 378 respondents who had never used a ride-sharing platform. Partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) is used to verify the research model and hypotheses. The empirical results reveal that perceived value is positively associated with consumer willingness to participate in ride-sharing, but perceived risk is negatively related to consumers’ ride-sharing intention. Contrary to expectations, perceived risk positively moderates the effect of perceived value on consumers’ ride-sharing intention. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of the effects of consumers’ value perception and risk perception on their acceptance of internet-based ride-sharing services. Measures to promote ride-sharing include maximising consumers’ value of ride-sharing and their perception of value as well as reducing potential risks in ride-sharing process. © 2019","Perceived risk; Perceived value; Ride-sharing services; Willingness to use","China; Least squares approximations; Risk assessment; Partial least square (PLS); Perceived risk; Perceived value; Ride-sharing; Second-order constructs; Structural equation modelling; Sustainable transport; Willingness to use; car use; consumption behavior; perception; questionnaire survey; risk assessment; transportation economics; transportation system; travel behavior; Risk perception","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85067915440"

Use of all-electric drive trains is arguably the most realistic medium-term solution to address these concerns. However, motorist anxiety induced by an electric vehicle's limited range and high battery cost have constrained consumer adoption. A novel switching-station-based solution is touted as a promising remedy. Vehicles use standardized batteries that, when depleted, can be switched for fully charged batteries at switching stations, and motorists only pay for battery use. We build a model that highlights the key mechanisms driving adoption and use of electric vehicles in this new switching-station-based electric vehicle system and contrast it with conventional electric vehicles. Our model employs results from repairable item inventory theory to capture switching-station operation; we embed this model in a behavioral model of motorist use and adoption. Switching-station systems effectively transfer range risk from motorists to the station operator, who, through statistical economies of scale, can better manage it. We find that this transfer of risk can lead to higher electric vehicle adoption than in a conventional system, but it also encourages more driving than a conventional system does. We calibrate our models with motorist behavior data, electric vehicle technology data, operation costs, and emissions data to estimate the relative effectiveness of the two systems under the status quo and other plausible future scenarios. We find that the system that is more effective at reducing emissions is often less effective at reducing oil dependence, and the misalignment between the two objectives is most severe when the energy mix is coal heavy and has advanced battery technology. Increases in gasoline prices (by imposition of taxes, for instance) are much more effective in reducing carbon emissions, whereas battery-price-reducing policy interventions are more effective for reducing oil dependence. Taken together, our results help a policy maker identify the superior system for achieving the desired objectives. They also highlight that policy makers should not conflate the dual objectives of oil dependence and emissions reductions as the preferred system, and the policy interventions that further that system may be different for the two objectives. © 2015 INFORMS.","Business model innovation; Electric vehicles; Public policy; Sustainable operations; Transportation","Automobile drivers; Carbon footprint; Coal industry; Cost benefit analysis; Crude oil price; Decision making; Digital storage; Economics; Electric automobiles; Electric drives; Electric vehicles; Emission control; Petroleum transportation; Public policy; Switching; Transportation; Business model innovation; Conventional systems; Electric drive train; Emissions reduction; Policy intervention; Repairable-item inventory; Sustainable operations; Transportation sector; Automotive batteries","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84926639675"

The diffusion of AVs may be significantly affected by the public's acceptance. A few factors that may affect people's acceptance of AVs have been researched in the existing studies, one-third of which cited behavioral theories, while the rest did not. A total of seven factors with behavior theories are screened out that significantly affect the acceptance intention, including perceived ease of use, attitude, social norm, trust, perceived usefulness, perceived risk, and compatibility. Six factors without behavior theories are summed up that affect AV acceptance, namely safety, performance-to-price value, mobility, value of travel time, symbolic value, and environmentally friendly. We found that people in Europe and Asia have substantial differences in attitudes toward AVs and that safety is one of the most concerned factors of AVs by scholars and respondents. Public acceptance of the different types of AVs and consumers' dynamic preferences for AVs are highlighted in the review too. The quality of literature is systematically assessed based on previously established instruments and tailored for the current review. The results of the assessment show potential opportunities for future research, such as the citation of behavior theories and access to longitudinal data. Additionally, the experimental methods and the utilization of mathematical and theoretical methods could be optimized. © 2020 by the authors.","Autonomous vehicles; Dynamic preference; Public acceptance","Asia; Europe; automation; environmental impact; exhaust emission; perception; public attitude; road transport; technology adoption; theoretical study; traffic congestion; transportation safety; travel time","Review","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85082878572"

Both processes derive from the UK's policy for sustainable development and in particular, the UK's Framework for Environmental Behaviours that strongly advocates a social marketing approach towards behavioural change. This paper examines whether carbon footprinting and labelling food products, borne from an overarching policy imperative to decarbonise food systems, is a tool that will actively facilitate consumers to make 'greener' purchasing decisions and whether this is a sensible way of trying to achieve to a low carbon future. We do so by drawing from a survey exploring purchasing habits and perceptions in relation to various sustainability credentials of food products and particularly 'carbon', using a combination of descriptive and cluster analysis. The data, from 428 UK supermarket shoppers, reveals that whilst consumer demand is relatively strong for carbon labels with a stated preference rate of 72%, confusion in interpreting and understanding labels is correspondingly high at a total of 89%, primarily as a result of poor communication and market proliferation. Three statistically distinct clusters were produced from the cluster analysis, representing taxonomies of consumers with quite different attitudes to carbon and other wider sustainability issues. Whilst the majority of consumers are likely to react positively to further carbon labelling of food products, this in itself is unlikely to drive much change in food systems. As such, the data imply that a concerted policy drive to decarbonise food systems via voluntary carbon footprinting and labelling policy initiatives is limited by a fragmented and haphazard market approach where retailers are being careful not to disaffect certain products by labelling others within the same category. Consumers may want to make choices based on the carbon footprint of products but do not feel empowered to do so and relying on consumer guilt is inappropriate. The paper concludes that the establishment of effective linkages between food policy and food market actors to drive a targeted and coherent carbon labelling policy is needed. This would provide consumers with the opportunity to make informed choices, especially within food product categories and negate the need for retailers to depend on the demand side of the supply chain to achieve carbon reduction targets. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Behavioural change; Carbon footprint; Carbon label; Consumer demand; Food policy: sustainable development","United Kingdom; cluster analysis; consumption behavior; demand-side management; food market; food policy; retailing; sustainability; sustainable development","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-80855123533"

To date, research has focused on how to increase the sustainability of packaging through the use of eco-design tools, and there has been only limited investigation of the relationship between sustainable packaging and consumer behavior during the purchase and recycling stages of the packaging life cycle. The present study examines the factors that influence consumers' product purchasing behavior and their recycling behavior with respect to sustainable packaging. Data from an online survey of 215 respondents in Portugal was used to test several hypotheses by comparing two groups of consumers: one group that places importance on environmentally friendly packaging and another that regards such packaging as unimportant in product purchase decisions. The results obtained show that gender, environmental awareness, concerns about societal opinions, a positive attitude towards green purchasing, and the perception of consumer actions are factors that differentiate the two groups of consumers. The findings should prove of use to public decision-makers, companies producing packaging, and marketers. However, features such as price are still needed to alter the behavior of consumers with respect to encouraging the use of sustainable packaging. In the near future, the study should be spread to a national scale to extend the findings of the present study, and to explore further aspects of consumer pro-environmental behavior with respect to sustainable packaging, including how the relationship between product and packaging may influence consumer behavior. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This paper aims to develop an integrated model designed to predict and explain an individual's continuous use of SSTs based on the concepts of technology readiness (TR), technology acceptance model (TAM), and theory of planned behavior (TPB). Design/methodology/approach The participants are from 481 SST users as the sample finally. Structural equation modeling is applied to demonstrate the stability of the proposed model and the results of hypotheses testing. Findings This paper finds that consumers' satisfaction significantly influences continuance intention, while the perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, subjective norm (SN), and perceived behavioral control (PBC) simultaneously influence satisfaction. Optimism and innovativeness are also the significant motivators of satisfaction. However, TR's inhibitors (discomfort and insecurity) have no significantly negative influence on continuance intention towards adopting SST services. Research limitations/implications Different from previous SSTs studies, this paper suggests that SN and PBC play critical factors in users' adoption at SSTs encounters. However, additionally empirical evidences should be discussed why the inhibitors (discomfort and insecurity) of TR have no effect. Originality/value This paper proposes a comprehensive model to synthesize the essence of TR, TAM, and TPB for explaining customers' continuous intention of SSTs.

Apart from direct shopping features in shopbots (e.g., search fields), SSCs additionally offer user-generated social shopping features. These include recommendation lists, ratings, styles (i.e., assortments arranged by users), tags, and user profiles. Purchases can be made by following a link to a participating online shop (""click-out""). SSCs are experiencing high growth rates in consumer popularity (e.g., Polyvore attracts more than 6 million unique visitors per month). Thus, this business model has received considerable venture capital in recent years. By analyzing clickstream data, we investigate which factors, especially social shopping features, are significant for predicting purchasing behavior within SSCs. Our logit model includes about 2.73 million visiting sessions and shows that social shopping features exert a significant impact, both positive and negative. Tags and high ratings have a positive impact on a click-out. In contrast, the more lists and styles used, the less likely the user is to make a click-out. Yet, lists and styles seem to enhance site stickiness and browsing. Moreover, the more direct shopping features that are used, the less likely the user is to conduct a click-out. Increasing transaction costs and information overload could be potential reasons. We also found that community members are more likely to make a click-out than ordinary users. This implies that community members are more profitable.","Clickstream data; online consumer purchasing behavior; social shopping; user-generated content; virtual community","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84555208237"

We have introduced three modifications to this method. First, the valuation is made in terms of water consumption. Secondly, we obtain the components of the impacts of each block of activity into which the economy is divided, with these components being described as the internal effect, mixed linkage, net or external backward linkage, and net or external forward linkage. Thirdly, this methodology is used to detect key sectors. Our results confirm the marked importance of the Agriculture, Food and Other Services blocks as regards the direct and indirect consumption of water in general. We also find that Other Services, Chemicals, Metals and Electronics and Agriculture blocks play an important role in explaining the consumption of drinking water. Moreover, the HEM analysis allows us to classify productive sectors according to their forward or backward linkage character in a way that is more precise than that permitted by earlier methods. Finally, this methodology can be extended to other types of environmental pressures. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

But studies show that new innovations fail at a staggering rate. While many blame these misses on lackluster products, the reality isn't so simple. The goods that consumers dismiss often do offer improvements over existing ones. So why don't people purchase them? And why do companies keep peddling products that buyers are likely to reject? The answer, says the author, can be found in the brain. New products force consumers to change their behavior, and that has a psychological cost. Many products fail because people irrationally over-value the benefits of the goods they own over those they don't possess. Executives, meanwhile, overvalue their own innovations. This leads to a serious clash. Studies show, in fact, that there is a mismatch of nine to one, or 9x, between what innovators think consumers want and what consumers truly desire. Fortunately, companies can overcome this disconnect. To start, they can determine where their products fall in a matrix with four categories: easy sells, sure failures, long hauls, and smash hits. Each has a different ratio of product improvement to change required from the consumer. Once businesses know where their products fit into this grid, they can manage the resistance to change. For some innovations, major behavior change is a given. In those cases, companies can either wait for consumers to warm to the product, make the improvement so great that buyers get past their apprehension, or try to eliminate the incumbent product. Firms can also try to minimize buyer resistance by making products that are compatible with incumbent goods, seeking out those who are not yet users of the existing product, or finding true believers.","","Choice Behavior; Commerce; Consumer Satisfaction; Diffusion of Innovation; Humans; United States; commercial phenomena; consumer; decision making; human; mass communication; review; United States","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-33744783107"

Furthermore, the facilitative effect of smile intensity on warmth perceptions is more prominent among promotion-focused consumers and in low-risk consumption contexts, while the detrimental effect of smile intensity on competence perceptions is more likely to occur among prevention-focused consumers and in high-risk consumption situations.

Store-brand market shares differ by country and are usually much higher in Europe than in the United States. The authors study the notion that the differential success of store brands in the United States and Europe is the higher brand equity that store brands command in Europe than in the United States. They use a framework based on consumer brand choice under uncertainty and brands as signals of product positions to conduct their analysis. More specifically, they examine whether uncertainty about quality (or the positioning of the brand in the product space); perceived quality of store brands versus national brands; consistency in store-brand offerings over time; and consumer attitudes toward risk, quality, and price underlie the differential success of store brands at least partially in the United States and Europe. The authors' model is estimated on scanner-panel data on laundry detergent in the U.S., U.K., and Spanish markets and on toilet paper and margarine data in the U.S. and Spanish markets. The authors find that consumer learning and perceived risk (and associated brand equity), as well as consumer attitude toward risk, quality, and price, play an important role in consumers' store-brand and national-brand choices and contribute to the differences in relative success of store brands across the countries studied.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-1442332638"

Second, for dissatisfied switchers, only the structural bond has a significant impact on customer's utilitarian value, which significantly improves customer loyalty. Third, for satisfied switchers, the social bond significantly affects the hedonic value, whereas the structural bond significantly affects the utilitarian value. Furthermore, both utilitarian and hedonic values have significant effects on customer loyalty. The authors discuss the managerial implications and directions for further research. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

This study aimed to determine the most acceptable and effective front-of-pack food labelling system for Australian consumers. Consumers' preferences and ability to compare the healthiness of mock food products were assessed for different front-of-pack labelling systems. Four systems were tested, including two variations of the Percentage Daily Intake system (Monochrome %DI and Colour-Coded %DI), which displays the proportion of daily nutrient contribution that a serve of food provides; and two variations of the Traffic Light (TL) system (Traffic Light and Traffic Light + Overall Rating), which uses colour-coding to indicate nutrient levels. Intercept surveys with 790 consumers were conducted, where each participant was exposed to a single labelling system for performance testing. Participants indicated strong support for the inclusion of nutrient information on total fat, saturated fat, sugar and sodium on the front of packages, and a consistent labelling format across all products. Using the TL system, participants were five times more likely to identify healthier foods compared with the Monochrome %DI system [odds ratio (OR) = 5.18; p < 0.001], and three times more likely compared with the Colour-Coded %DI system (OR = 3.01; p < 0.05). Consumers supported the introduction of consistent front-of-pack food labelling. The TL system was the most effective in assisting consumers to identify healthier foods. Mandatory TL labelling regulations are recommended to assist consumers in making healthy food choices. © The Author (2009). Published by Oxford University Press.

This paper aims to investigate an important type of consumer behaviour that could generate considerable economic value: impulsive purchase behaviour. Specifically, we focus on the role of peer influence. Social influence theory posits that the process via which peers change a consumer’s behaviour can be interpreted along two dimensions: informational and normative. Furthermore, drawing from literature, source credibility and social support are proposed as the antecedent factors of the influencing processes in this context. We surveyed 303 s-commerce participants in Sina Weibo to empirically test the research model. The results indicate that peers’ expertise and trustworthiness are significantly related to both types of social influence that could exert an influence on a consumer. Further, consumers’ exchange of informational and emotional social support significantly facilitates social influence among them. This study contributes to both the s-commerce and the impulsive purchase literature by revealing the role of peer influence in consumers’ impulsive consumption behaviour in the s-commerce setting. The practical implications are also illustrated in the paper. © 2019, Copyright © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Impulsive purchase; peer influence; social commerce; social influence; social support","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85069453481"

Nevertheless, the extent to which consumers truly prefer to use these new outlets to discuss lesser-known products as opposed to spending most of their energies on discussing widely marketed or already successful products has so far remained an open question. We explore this question by investigating how a population's propensity to contribute postconsumption online reviews for different products of the same category (motion pictures) relates to various indicators of those products' popularity. We discover that, ceteris paribus, consumers prefer to post reviews for products that are less available and less successful in the market. At the same time, however, they are also more likely to contribute reviews for products that many other people have already commented on online. The presence of these two opposite forces leads to a U-shaped relationship between a population's average propensity to review a movie postconsumption and that movie's box office revenues: moviegoers appear to be more likely to contribute reviews for very obscure movies but also for very high-grossing movies. Our findings suggest that online forum designers who wish to increase the contribution of user reviews for lesser-known products should make information about the volume of previously posted reviews a less-prominent feature of their sites. © 2010 M.E.

Rapid and innovative advances in digital media offer opportunities for health education, which could result in increased preventive behaviors. This study assessed preventive behaviors against contracting COVID-19 and tested mediation pathways linking four types of digital media consumption (social media, mobile social networking apps [MSNs], online news media, and social live steaming services [SLSSs]) to preventive behaviors, mediated by worry. Results from an online survey (N = 511) revealed that the vast majority (>90 percent) of respondents had very often or always practiced preventive behaviors against contracting COVID-19 such as washing their hands more regularly with soap and water, staying away from crowded places, and wearing face masks out in public. In addition, COVID-19 information seeking through the four types of digital media was a salient parameter that encouraged people to practice preventive behaviors either directly or indirectly. Specifically, seeking COVID-19-related information on MSNs, SLSSs, and online news media was directly associated with preventive behaviors. Whereas COVID-19 information consumption on social media, MSNs, and SLSSs during the infectious disease outbreak could elicit intense worry and, in turn, increase preventive behaviors.

Design/methodology/approach: Three cities were chosen, in different regions of Spain, and of different sizes. A total of 402 valid interviews were carried out in two industries: tile manufacturing and tourism. The selection procedure was random. Findings: The results show that the consumer's satisfaction is the main basis for perceived relationship quality. The paper likewise verifies the importance of transaction-level evaluations for perceived relationship quality. The automatic affective reactions generated in the consumer in the first moments, and the social impact of the purchase, are aspects that determine perceived relationship quality. The paper also looks at the importance of considering commitment as an attitude. Research limitations/implications: The intention to repurchase should be incorporated, together with the social norms identified, in the model of Fishbein and Ajzen. Practical implications: To gain a customer's loyalty it is necessary to achieve his/her satisfaction. A supplier must pay attention to customers' trust and commitment throughout all transactions. Suppliers must take care of the quality of their products and the attention given by the contact personnel, paying special attention to certain emotional aspects relating to customers' enjoyment of the product and to their stay in the sales outlet during the process of deciding to purchase.

The present research empirically examines the effect of both objective and subjective knowledge on perceived risk and, in turn, key consumer behaviors associated with GM food. The results reveal that objective knowledge about GM food significantly reduces performance and psychological risks, whereas subjective knowledge influences only physical risk, and the valence of that impact depends on the level of the consumer's objective knowledge. Furthermore, different risk types enhance consumers' information search and reduce their propensity to buy GM food. The overall findings thus suggest the need for cooperation among government, scientific institutions, and the food industry to foster effective communication strategies that increase consumers' objective knowledge, reduce their risk perceptions, and encourage consumer adoptions of GM technology. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-33846985275"

Theoretical research on such channel structures has analyzed the optimal behavior of channel members under alternative assumptions of manufacturer-retailer interaction (Vertical Strategic Interaction). Research in Empirical Industrial Organization has focused on analyzing the competitive interactions between manufacturers (Horizontal Strategic Interaction). Decision support systems have made various assumptions about retailer-pricing rules (eg., constant markup, category-profit-maximization). The appropriateness of such assumptions about strategic behavior for any specific market, however, is an empirical question. This paper therefore empirically infers (1) the Vertical Strategic Interaction (VSI) between manufacturers and retailer, (2) the Horizontal Strategic Interaction (HSI) between manufacturers simultaneously with the VSI, and (3) the pricing rule used by a retailer. The approach is particularly appealing because it can be used with widely available scanner data, where there is no information on wholesale prices. Researchers usually have no access to wholesale prices. Even manufacturers, who have access to their own wholesale prices, usually have limited information on competitors' wholesale prices. In the absence of wholesale prices, we derive formulae for wholesale prices using game-theoretic solution techniques under the specific assumptions of vertical and horizontal strategic interaction and retailer-pricing rules. We then embed the formulae for wholesale prices into the estimation equations. While our empirical illustration is using scanner data without wholesale prices, the model itself can be applied when wholesale prices are available. Early research on the inference of HSI among manufacturers in setting wholesale prices using scanner data (e.g., Kadiyali et al. 1996, 1999) made the simplifying assumption that retailers charge a constant margin. This assumption enabled them to infer wholesale prices and analyze competitive interactions between manufacturers. In this paper, we show that this model is econometrically identical to a model that measures retail-price coordination across brands. Hence, the inferred cooperation among manufacturers could be exaggerated by the coordinated pricing (category management) done by the retailer. We find empirical support for this argument. This highlights the need to properly model and infer VSI simultaneously to accurately estimate the HSI when using data at the retail level. Functional forms of demand have been evaluated in terms of the fit of the model to sales data. But recent theoretical research on channels (Lee and Staelin 1997, Tyagi 1999) has shown that the functional form has serious implications for strategic behavior such as retail passthrough. While the logit and linear model implies equilibrium passthrough of less than 100% (Lee and Staelin call this Vertical Strategic Substitute (VSS)), the multiplicative model implies optimal passthrough of greater than 100% (Vertical Strategic Complement (VSC)). Because passthrough rates on promotions have been found to be below or above 100% (Chevalier and Curhan 1976, Armstrong 1991), we empirically test the appropriateness of the logit (VSS) and the multiplicative (VSC) functional form for the data. We perform our analysis in the yogurt and peanut butter categories for the two biggest stores in a local market. We found that the VSS implications of the logit fit the data better than the multiplicative model. We also find that for both categories, the best-fitting model is one in which (1) the retailer maximizes category profits, (2) the VSI is Manufacturer-Stackelberg, and (3) manufacturer pricing (HSI) is tacitly collusive. The fact that the retailer maximizes category profits is consistent with theoretical expectations. The inference that the VSI is Manufacturer-Stackelberg reflects the institutional reality of the timing of the game. Retailers set their retail prices after manufacturers set their wholesale prices. Note that in the stores and product categories that we analyze, the two manufacturers own the dominant brands with combined market shares of about 82% in the yogurt market and 65% in the peanut butter market. The result is also consistent with a balance of power argument in the literature. The finding that manufacturer pricing is tacitly collusive is consistent with the argument that firms involved in long-term competition in concentrated markets can achieve tacit collusion.

This article aims to focus on the attitude and behaviour of Belgians towards Latin-American ethnic foods, and of Hispanics living in Belgium towards mainstream Belgian food. Design/methodology/approach - The role of socio-demographic characteristics, food neophobia, and degree of acculturation or openness on food preference and choice among these two population groups is analysed. A survey with 119 Belgian and 127 Hispanic participants was performed. Data analysis deals with descriptive analyses and statistical validation of the perceived associations by means of chi-square, t-test, ANOVA, correlations, and stepwise multiple regression. Findings - The overall opinion and degree of satisfaction of the Belgian sample towards ethnic food were favourable. Latin-American food consumption and attitude of Belgians are negatively correlated with food neophobia, which is significantly higher among urban and 55+ aged consumers, and positively correlated with openness to new cultures. Taste and appearance were key attributes that determined Belgians' preference for ethnic foods. Hispanics' general perception towards Belgian mainstream food was favourable as well, although they considered their own food as being better in taste. Barriers to maintain Latin-American food habits are availability and time constraints. Hispanics' adoption of traditional Belgian cuisine is positively correlated with time of residence in Belgium and negatively correlated with maintenance of native social interaction and language use. Food neophobia does not emerge as a determinant of Hispanics' dietary acculturation to mainstream Belgian food. Research limitations/implications - Data are collected from a relatively small convenience sample, which limits generalisation of the findings beyond the sample characteristics, which renders the findings exploratory rather than conclusive. Originality/value - This paper covers important, not well-explored and previously neglected research subjects, namely attitude, perceptions and behaviour towards ethnic food and food consumption among ethnic minorities in the increasingly globalised food market. The main contribution pertains to simultaneously investigating the role of socio-demographic, acculturation and food neophobia on food consumption decisions. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Acculturation; Attitudes; Belgium; Consumers; Food products; Hispanics","","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-27644489413"

Hosts generally present themselves online as (1) a well-traveled individual, eager to meet new people or (2) an individual of a certain profession.

Although consumer attitudes towards sustainable products and services, both in general and specifically in clothing, have grown more and more favourable in the past years, the market share of clothing produced in environmentally friendly and socially responsible ways is still lagging behind. This article empirically investigates this phenomenon, known as the attitude-behaviour gap, in the context of sustainable clothing. Based on a large sample of female German consumers, a structural equation model is estimated to assess the magnitude of the attitude-behaviour gap and the impact of possible enablers of, and barriers to, sustainable clothing purchase behaviour. The value-attitude-behaviour hierarchy is used as a theoretical framework, augmented by further psychographic constructs hypothesised to influence behaviour. Apart from a considerable attitude-behaviour gap, the article indicates that a positive attitude towards social-ecological clothing standards, biospheric and altruistic values, as well as an affinity to online and catalogue shopping, enhance sustainable clothing purchases. Egoistic and hedonic values and, remarkably, a preference for durable clothing hinder sustainable clothing purchase behaviour. No significant effects of the suspected barriers – fashion consciousness and price sensitivity – have been identified. The results thus highlight the importance of changing attitudes and values towards sustainability, and of focusing on the durability of sustainable clothing and its availability via retail stores. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Attitude-behaviour gap; Determinants; Structural equation modelling; Sustainable clothing; Sustainable consumption; Value-attitude-behaviour hierarchy","Competition; Retail stores; Sustainable development; Attitude-behaviour gap; Determinants; Structural equation modelling; Sustainable clothing; Sustainable consumption; Value-attitude-behaviour hierarchy; Sales","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85053184801"

So far, environmental dimension was far more researched than social dimension. In this article, we investigate the antecedents of both environmentally and socially RSCB and willingness to behave in environmentally/socially responsible way. We include measures of concern, perceived consumer control/effectiveness, personal/social norms and ethical ideologies/obligation to better explain and extend the traditional theory of planned behavior. Additionally, we test the impact of information availability about environmental or social impact on RSCB. Our findings on a representative sample of 426 respondents (ages 18 to 65) show that in general, antecedents of environmentally and socially responsible sustainable consumption are similar in their effect on consumer behavior, with personal norms, concern and ethical ideologies having the strongest impact on RSCB. When comparing both types of behavior, socially responsible behavior is more influenced by perceived behavioral control and possibly social norms than environmentally responsible behavior, while information availability plays its role for both behaviors. Sustainable responsible consumption can be achieved by embracing both dimensions of sustainability and consumers need to have a sense for both social and environmental issues. The complexity and struggles between doing what is good for environment and society could be the reason why consumers have difficulties achieving sustainable responsible consumption. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Concern; Ethical ideologies; Perceived control; Personal/social norms; Responsible sustainable behavior","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077538116"

But, smart objects pose unique challenges for considering the emergence of consumer–object relationships, because their degrees of agency, autonomy, and authority lend them their own unique capacities for interaction. We present a new framework for consumer–object relationships based on the circumplex model of interpersonal complementarity and situated in assemblage theory and object-oriented ontology. Consumer–object relationship styles are defined in terms of two foundational dimensions of behavior, agency, and communion, based on the expressive roles played by consumer and object. The overlay of assemblage theory provides a conceptually rich understanding of the space of master–servant, partner, and unstable relationship styles, along with their concomitant positive (enabling) versus negative (constraining) consumer experiences. The model’s underlying geometry supports extensive empirical work and provides a powerful managerial framework for measuring and tracking consumer–object relationships and the journeys they take over time. © 2018, Academy of Marketing Science.","Assemblage theory; Consumer experience; Consumer journeys; Intelligent devices; Internet of things; Object experience","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85054865345"

By looking into social media influencer–follower relations, this study suggests that the long-held conventional concept of parasocial relation no longer fully encompasses the evolving contemporary human interactions and related relations. The current analysis recommends an updated notion and theorization—a trans-parasocial relation—to capture a collectively reciprocal, (a)synchronously interactive, and co-created relation between influencers and their captive followers. This trans-parasocial relation concept offers a foundation on which new communicative and advertising theories can be developed to explicate new forms of social interactions and consumer behavior. More importantly, in view of this trans-parasocial relation, assumptions of the existing persuasion theory—that is, the persuasion knowledge model—need to be reassessed. The current findings demonstrate that persuasion knowledge does not always negatively affect advertising outcomes. Instead, followers indicate mostly benign attitudes toward influencer-sponsored posts, interpret influencers’ sponsorship disclosures as genuine and transparent, and internalize disclosure actions as inspiring and admirable. This study further identifies and elucidates several psychological mechanisms that account for followers’ overall appreciation of influencer-sponsored posts: positive bias, verification by cross-validation, and inspirational internalization. © Copyright © 2021, American Academy of Advertising.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85102205111"

Within a multinomial logit model of consumer choice over substitutes, we develop a stochastic dynamic programming formulation and derive the optimal dynamic pricing policy. We prove that dynamic pricing converges to static pricing as inventory levels of all variates approach the number of remaining selling periods (assuming at most one customer arrival within each period). Our extensive numerical study of the effects of time and inventory depletion on the optimal pricing reveals two fundamental underlying driving forces of the complex price behavior: the level of inventory scarcity and the quality difference among products. We also compare the performance of three restricted pricing strategies: static, unified dynamic, and mixed dynamic pricing. We find that full-scale dynamic pricing is of great value in the presence of inventory scarcity, and initial inventory decisions are quite robust in the pricing scheme employed in the selling season. Based on the above insights, we propose a computationally efficient approach to the initial inventory decision, which delivers close-to-optimal inventory levels for all testing cases. © 2009 INFORMS.","Dynamic pricing; Inventory control; Multinomial logit model; Substitute products","Dynamic programming; Inventory control; Optimization; Sales; Stochastic models; Systems engineering; Computationally efficient; Consumer choice; Customer arrivals; Driving forces; Dynamic pricing; Inventory decisions; Inventory depletion; Inventory levels; Leadtime; Multinomial logit model; Numerical studies; Optimal dynamic pricing; Pricing scheme; Pricing strategy; Stochastic dynamic programming; Substitute products; Testing case; Costs","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-67649982772"

With a comprehensive analysis of digital technologies and data strategy informed by structuration theory and privacy literature, the authors consider privacy tensions as the product of firm–consumer interactions, facilitated by digital technologies. This perspective in turn implies distinct consumer, regulatory, and firm responses related to data protection. By consolidating various perspectives, the authors propose three tenets and seven propositions, supported by interview insights from senior managers and consumer informants, that create a foundation for understanding the digital technology implications for firm performance in contexts marked by growing privacy worries and legal ramifications. On the basis of this conceptual framework, they also propose a data strategy typology across two main strategic functions of digital technologies: data monetization and data sharing. The result is four distinct types of firms, which engage in disparate behaviors in the broader ecosystem pertaining to privacy issues.

The predictive power of marketing studies based on demographics was no longer strong enough to serve as a basis for marketing strategy, he argued. Buying patterns had become far better guides to consumers' future purchases. In addition, properly constructed nondemographic segmentations could help companies determine which products to develop, which distribution channels to sell them in, how much to charge for them, and how to advertise them. But more than 40 years later, nondemographic segmentation has become just as unenlightening as demographic segmentation had been. Today, the technique is used almost exclusively to fulfill the needs of advertising, which it serves mainly by populating commercials with characters that viewers can identify with. It is true that psychographic types like ""High-Tech Harry"" and ""Joe Six-Pack"" may capture some truth about real people's lifestyles, attitudes,self-image, and aspirations. But they are no better than demographics at predicting purchase behavior. Thus they give corporate decision makers very little idea of how to keep customers or capture new ones. Now, Daniel Yankelovich returns to these pages, with consultant David Meer, to argue the case for a broad view of non-demographic segmentation. They describe the elements of a smart segmentation strategy, explaining how segmentations meant to strengthen brand identity differ from those capable of telling a company which markets it should enter and what goods to make. And they introduce their ""gravity of decision spectrum,"" a tool that focuses on the form of consumer behavior that should be of the greatest interest to marketers-the importance that consumers place on a product or product category.","","Commerce; Economic Competition; United States; commercial phenomena; economic aspect; organization and management; review; United States","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-32644451692"

Although credit is for future consumption, nonsophisticated consumers overborrow, pay the penalties, and back load repayment, suffering large welfare losses.

Extant research and concepts from various fields, including marketing, psychology and information system (IS), are reviewed, deriving six hypotheses. Data from SST users is examined through structural equation modeling (SEM). Findings - Results indicate TR influences perceived SST service quality and behavioral intentions, while perceived SST service quality has a positive impact on customer satisfaction and behavioral intentions toward SSTs. Research limitations/implications - This study represents an early attempt at explaining the role of TR in customer SST usage. Future research directions are discussed, with an emphasis on incorporating attitudinal, behavioral, situational and psychographic factors to improve our understanding of SST usage. Practical implications - TR should be given increased attention by firms implementing SSTs to improve customer perception and adoption of SSTs. Firms also need to examine all SST service quality dimensions in order to improve customer satisfaction and behavioral intentions toward SSTs. An aggressive approach toward strengthening TR drivers and reducing TR inhibitors will show benefits for both firms and customers.

Data are from the French perfume market, in which some market leaders are decades old while hundreds of new entrants launch yearly. The authors reveal monotonically increasing differences across age ranges. Younger consumers have a greater propensity to change their preferred brand, a form of innovativeness that benefits relatively recent entrants, whereas older consumers exhibit a propensity to remain attached for a longer duration to the same preferred brand. Nostalgia for options encountered during an early ""formative period"" has only a limited impact. Furthermore, strong heterogeneity emerges: At all ages, some consumers frequently change their preferred brand, whereas others remain attached to it for long periods. It is the proportion of these two behaviors that varies across age ranges. The resultant managerial implications indicate that mature consumers are attractive targets because they likely remain attached to a brand longer, that long-established products may still attract new consumers, and that the success of a new brand among young consumers may be ephemeral. © 2010, American Marketing Association.","Age; Attachment; Heterogeneity; Innovativeness; Nostalgia; Older consumers; Perfume; Product choice","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-77956676169"

They are prepared to switch products for ecological reasons and stop buying products from companies that cause pollution. Firms and other economic institutions are aware of the importance of reflecting these attitudes towards the environment in developing their products. This paper is focused on environmental attitudes as meaningful predictor of ecological behaviour. A three-dimensional approach to this variable has been developed, which addresses its emotional, cognitive and conative components. A random sample survey of 573 individuals was used to verify the conceptual model and framework. This model was assessed initially by principal factor analysis and subsequently, by structural equation modelling. Findings of this study showed that environmental attitudes have a significant effect on ecological behaviour.

It refers to significant others in the context of momentous life events and fosters a sense of social connectedness. On this basis, the authors hypothesized that (1) nostalgia promotes charitable intentions and behavior, and (2) this effect is mediated by empathy with the charity's beneficiaries. Five studies assessed the effect of nostalgia on empathy, intentions to volunteer and donate, as well as tangible charitable behavior. Results were consistent with the hypotheses. Study 1 found that nostalgia increases charitable intentions. Study 2 showed that this salutary effect of nostalgia on charitable intentions is mediated by empathy (but not by personal distress). Studies 3 and 4 corroborated these finding for different charities and in diverse samples. Finally, study 5 demonstrated that nostalgia increases tangible charitable behavior. By virtue of its capacity to increase empathy, nostalgia facilitates prosocial reactions.© 2011 by Journal of Consumer Research, Inc.","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84861750232"

A convenience sampling technique was used to collect data from a sample of 490 respondents in Pakistan. The data were analyzed using AMOS and SPSS for Cronbach’s α, CR, CMV, AVE, Harmon’s single factor test, correlation and structural equation modeling. Findings: The results of the study show that most of the predictors of intention, including perceived value, performance expectancy, habit, social influence, effort expectancy, hedonic motivation (except for facilitating condition), perceived risk and trust, are significant. All predictors of usage behavior are significant. Research limitations/implications: A cross-sectional study was conducted due to time constraints. Practical implications: Bank managers must focus on improving customers’ intentions to use m-banking as well as on providing facilitating conditions to increase its actual use. To boost mobile banking, banks’ management must consider the customers’ habits while designing their m-banking products. Originality/value: The findings of this paper are not only interesting in terms of boosting m-banking diffusion rate, but also in terms of financial inclusion of the vast majority of mobile users. Further the impact of intention, facilitating condition and habit were checked on actual use behavior since people tend not always to act upon their intentions. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Bank customers; Intention; M-banking; Pakistan; Use behaviour; UTAUT2","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85053276573"

Although the importance of trust has been well recognized in the literature, the previous studies have mainly focused on trust in e-commerce sites and failed to incorporate its multidimensional nature to study consumer behavior. To gain further insights into consumer decision-making, this study aims to develop a social commerce trust-based consumer decision-making framework. Based on the social-technical theory, we conceptualize social commerce trust in a multidimensional view including trust in social media, trust in e-commerce sites, trust in social commerce features, and trust in consumers. Data were collected from an online survey taken by U.S. Amazon consumers. Our results strongly support our new conceptualization of social commerce trust and demonstrate its importance by examining its effects on e-commerce outcomes. Further, trust in consumers and trust in social commerce features have stronger effects than trust in e-commerce sites and trust in social media in the formation of social commerce trust. Our study contributes to the theory by introducing the new conceptualization of social commerce trust and advancing our understanding of how to enhance social commerce trust.

This leads to a review of some of the research design and methodological problems and issues that are faced when rigorously studying these issues. Subsequently, the paper devotes a section to the provocative idea that while dysfunctional customer behavior has many negative influences on customers, employees, and service firms, there are actually some positive functions of customers behaving badly.

The results of 2 experiments show that, given sufficient desire for vengeance, some consumers will choose a suboptimal decision outcome to get even with a firm. We also find that it is the interpersonal factors of the redress experience, rather than its tangible outcomes, that drive consumers to exact revenge on firms after a dissatisfying experience.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0348252388"

This study examines an emerging area in E-commerce, i.e., social commerce. Extending the online consumer behavior typology, this study categorizes online consumer behaviors into three types: transactional, informational, and social. While traditional E-commerce supports the transactional and informational aspects of online shopping, social commerce fulfils the social aspects of shopping, and potentially enhances the informational aspect as well. This research examines the online shopper as a prospective user of an emerging social commerce platform, the social shopping website, which are sites designed specifically to support social interactions while online consumers shop. The study augments the Technology Acceptance Model with constructs that enhance the specificity of the model to the social shopping application of social commerce. The model was empirically tested and supported. The results provide empirical evidence to support the importance of distinguishing the social aspect of shopping from the information and transactional aspects, as well as the potential advantage to using technology to promote social interactions on E-commerce sites.

The pain of paying in cash can curb impulsive urges to purchase such unhealthy food products. Credit card payments, in contrast, are relatively painless and weaken impulse control. Consequently, consumers are more likely to buy unhealthy food products when they pay by credit card than when they pay in cash. Results from four studies support these hypotheses. Analysis of actual shopping behavior of 1,000 households over a period of 6 months revealed that shopping baskets have a larger proportion of food items rated as impulsive and unhealthy when shoppers use credit or debit cards to pay for the purchases (study 1). Follow-up experiments (studies 2-4) show that the vice-regulation effect of cash payments is mediated by pain of payment and moderated by chronic sensitivity to pain of payment.

Luxury consumption has been neglected, and yet many questions arise concerning the underlying dimensions of luxury shopping. Design/methodology/approach - Two scales were used: questions concerning luxury consumption were used in order to determine the sample of luxury consumers, and a PRECON scale was used to measure individual differences in consumers' prestige shopping preferences. After the scale validation process, factor analysis was conducted, along with regression analysis of all PRECON factors. Findings - The results show that in this market consumers perceive quality as a brand determinant. Further, strong patron status suggests a ""snob effect"" among respondents, who buy exclusive items in an attempt to distinguish themselves. Hence, rare products indicate respect and prestige among the respondents. Furthermore, this paper defines two sub-categories, namely ""old aristocracy"" and ""new money"", with the latter more ascendant in the case of a developing market. It also showed that luxury consumers behave similarly worldwide, regardless of economic or social surroundings. Research limitations/implications - Luxury consumption should be put in the context of psychological determinants, and perhaps tested according to lifestyle.

Under high-behavioral relevance, attitudes predicted behavior well regardless of complexity. Amount of knowledge had no effect on attitude- behavior consistency. In Experiment 3, the findings of Experiment 2 were replicated, and the complexity effect was extended to behaviors of ambiguous relevance.

The customer brand engagement is treated in the current study as multidimensional constructs comprising three main aspects: cognitive processing (CP), affection (AF), and activation (AC). It was also proposed a direct influence for these three aspects of CBE on consumer-based brand equity (CBBE). Using online surveys, we gathered data from fans/followers of mobile phone service providers, via Facebook fan pages in Jordan. The data were analysed using structural equation modelling. Based on structural equation modelling analyses (SEM), it was supported that CBE aspects were largely predicted by the role of consumer involvement (INV), consumer participation (COP), and self-expressive brand (SEB). However, we find that activation impact one dimension of the CBBE dimensions, namely, brand loyalty. Further, we find that brand awareness/associations affect perceived quality but not brand loyalty. To validate the CBE scale, future studies could investigate the impact of the scale using other social media platforms for different brands. The limited amount of empirical research on CBE was the motivation behind this research. In particular, there is no study that has investigated the main predictors of CBE and its consequences over developing context by proposing and testing the association between the antecedents of CBE with the dimensions of CBE, which in turn affect the dimensions of CBBE. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Brand engagement; Brand equity; Consumer involvement; Self-expressive brand; Social media","Jordan; cognition; consumption behavior; empirical analysis; mobile phone; service provision; social media","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85063101874"

Mobile tourism shopping refers to the use of m-devices to shop for tourism products and services. Given the benefits and potential of this channel, the acceptance however is not widespread and currently an under-addressed topic among academicians. Specifically practitioners are also sceptical if consumers are ready to accept this alternative channel. Drawing upon the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Usage of Technology (UTAUT) as a baseline model, the proposed model was integrated with flow theory, psychological characteristic, social environment and security concern factors to study on the mobile consumers' behavioral intention. Through the use of Partial Least Squares-Structural Equation Modelling of 503 mobile respondents, it was discovered that some of the structural paths are not consistent with past literatures. Additionally, a non-parametric permutation approach has also been conducted to discover the gender and age differences in the decision making. The findings however are mixed and therefore require further testing. This study has valuable contributions to academicians, practitioners, and society. Academically, the integrated framework contributes to the tourism and marketing literatures by uniting UTAUT, flow theory, psychological characteristic, social environment and security concern factors. Practically, by focusing on the important factors affecting consumers’ decision to adopt mobile tourism shopping, organisations can create effective mobile marketing campaigns.

Conscious consumers remain a ‘work in progress’, and present a complex mix of behaviours; while seeking ethical alternatives, other social and economic forces impact on their behaviour (e.g. family, convenience, price) such that positive ethical choices are not always made. Examining ethical consumption in this way reveals the ‘competing priorities, paradoxical outcomes, and the nature of compromises reached in real decision processes’. We identify two areas of theory relevant to the conceptualization of such consumers, flexibility and dissonance theory. A qualitative study of participants identified as conscious consumers was undertaken. As anticipated, the participants revealed a range of often contradictory behaviours regarding their ethical purchases. The relevance of flexibility and dissonance theory to their behaviour is discussed. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Conscious consumer; Dissonance; Ethical consumption; Flexibility; Inconsistency","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-78049299216"

Increasing evidence indicates that it is possible to develop diets that are both environmentally sustainable and healthy, but their potential success largely depends on consumers’ willingness and ability to change their behavior. This study investigates consumer perceptions of the match, or mismatch, between healthy and sustainable diets, and gives insight into consumers’ motivation to eat healthily and sustainably, as measured by involvement. Data were collected in Spring 2014 through a cross-sectional quantitative online survey with samples representative for age, gender and region in four European Union (EU) countries (United Kingdom, Germany, Belgium, and the Netherlands) (n = 2783). The images of a healthy diet, a sustainable diet and a plant-based diet were found to be highly compatible based on a strongly observed match between European consumers’ perceptions of these concepts. Half of the participants were highly involved in healthy eating and one third in both healthy and sustainable eating. Informational food policy actions targeting both healthy and sustainable food consumption behavior are recommended to address issues relevant to the target segments, taking into account their levels of involvement. Increasing consumers’ motivation and involvement in health and sustainability emerges as a key trigger for increasing healthy and sustainable eating. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Food policy; Healthy eating; Involvement; Plant-based diets; Sustainable eating","Belgium; Germany; Netherlands; United Kingdom; consumption behavior; diet; food consumption; food policy; perception; sustainability","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85015374344"

Furthermore, it seeks to examine the level at which country of origin (COO) effect is activated (country, product or attribute) per consumer cluster of different level of CE in a food evaluation context. Design/methodology/approach: For attaining the above aims, a questionnaire was developed and completed by 274 respondents. The set of countries of origin and products under consideration encompasses Greece, Italy and Holland and yellow cheese, ham and beer. Findings: The use of the CET-SCALE pinpointed that the sample can be characterised as marginally ethnocentric. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses justified the uni-dimensionality of CE. Cluster analysis allocated the sample into two clusters, the ethnocentric and the non-ethnocentric. The results showed that ethnocentrism affects not only consumer beliefs, but also the way perceived quality of domestic and foreign products are evaluated, culminating in the appearance of COO-effect. In ethnocentric consumers, the COO effect is activated at the initiatory level of the country a food product originates in (country-specific), except when the foreign country of origin is given, where the COO effect is activated at the level of the product type (product-specific). In the non-ethnocentric cluster, COO does not lead to an overall acceptance or rejection, but instead it affects the evaluation of specific product attributes (attribute-specific). Research limitations/implications: The survey suffers the limitation of focusing on the influence of ethnocentric beliefs in food products evaluation and not on their real impact on final purchasing behaviour. Consumer ethnocentrism and COO effect are linked together, but the stimulus that activates their link differs according to the strength of ethnocentric beliefs held by consumers; that given, different marketing strategies should be applied depending on the level of CE of the target-group selected. Originality/value: Internationally, the issue of COO-effect is comprehensively examined, yet the literature has focused almost explicitly on hi-tech or fashion products and services. This fact attaches particular importance to the present study, which is concerned exclusively with food products. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Consumer behaviour; Country of origin; Ethnocentrism; Food products","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-35549009749"

In the presence of social learning, we should see different box-office sales dynamics depending on whether opening weekend demand is higher or lower than expected. I use a unique feature of the movie industry to identify ex ante demand expectations: the number of screens dedicated to a movie in its opening weekend reflects the sales expectations held by profit-maximizing theatre owners. Several pieces of evidence are consistent with social learning. First, sales of movies with positive surprise and negative surprise in opening weekend demand diverge over time. If a movie has better than expected appeal and therefore experiences larger than expected sales in Week 1, consumers in Week 2 update upward their expectations of quality, further increasing Week 2 sales. Second, this divergence is small for movies for which consumers have strong priors and large for movies for which consumers have weak priors. Third, the effect of a surprise is stronger for audiences with large social networks. Finally, consumers do not respond to surprises in first-week sales that are orthogonal to movie quality, like weather shocks. Overall, social learning appears to be an important determinant of sales in the movie industry, accounting for 32% of sales for the typical movie with positive surprise. This implies the existence of a large ""social multiplier"" such that the elasticity of aggregate demand to movie quality is larger than the elasticity of individual demand. © The Author 2011.

This article describes the development of a 22-item scale for assessing cognitive dissonance immediately after purchase. First, the article discusses the conceptualization of the construct, recognizing that dissonance is not only cognitive in nature, but also has an emotional component, consistent with Festinger's early description of dissonance as a psychologically uncomfortable state. The procedures used to develop and refine the scale are subsequently described. This included a qualitative study to generate the items and two samples for each stage of the quantitative stages of scale refinement.

Given the complexity and the range of variables that may determine the characterisation of these groups, as was made evident in the literature review, it was decided to focus this research mainly on analysing the environmental and demographic criteria. Design/methodology/approach: The data were collected through a survey of Portuguese consumers, aged over 18. The model of data collection was a survey conducted by self-administered questionnaire. A total of 887 were considered valid (the final sample). The questionnaire is composed of two sections. In the first part, data are collected about the demographic characteristics of respondents. The second part examines the environmental dimension (concern, affect, knowledge, environmentally friendly behaviours, information search, activism, green products buying behaviour, sensitivity to price, waste separation/recycling, perceived efficiency, scepticism, etc.). After collection, the data were statistically analysed and interpreted using the statistical software Statistical Package for Social Sciences 15.0. The data obtained were submitted to a multivariate statistical analysis, which included the following sequence of statistical treatment: factor analysis, cluster analysis and discriminant analysis. After this, a characterisation was made of the segments found. Findings: The results of this study show that there are consumers who buy green products and that certain environmental and demographic variables are significant for differentiating between the ""greener"" segment and the other segments. Yet, generally speaking, one is left with the impression that the Portuguese, despite their support for policies designed to improve the environment, do not translate their concerns into actions: they rarely join environmentalist associations and they do not take part in policy making. Their participation is often based on protecting the environment by saving electricity and water, which shows that these concerns may be more closely related with economic factors than with an environmental consciousness. It can be concluded that Portuguese consumers understand the challenges currently placed before the environment, and that they are aware of the existence of environmental problems, even though their concerns are not always translated into environmentally friendly behaviour. It was also noted that there are consumers who are prepared to base their buying decisions on purchasing products that do not harm the environment. In fact, it was seen that there is a segment of ""greener"" consumers in the sample that differs significantly in some aspects from the other market segments. Originality/value: The importance of market segmentation is highlighted, together with a presentation of the most relevant criteria for differentiating individuals in terms of their environmental behaviour. The results of this study show that there are consumers who buy green products and that certain environmental and demographic variables are significant for differentiating between the ""greener"" segment and the other segments. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Consumer behaviour; Green marketing; Market segmentation; Portugal","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-68549135011"

The purpose of this paper is to utilize theory from the psychology literature on interpersonal relationships to provide theoretical guidance for examining the nature of service loyalty and to uncover its dimensionality. Design/methodology/approach - This paper argues for and tests, using survey data from over 300 service customers, a multi-dimensional conceptualization of loyalty based on theory from the interpersonal psychology literature. Findings - The findings of this research highlight that service loyalty is similar to loyalty in interpersonal relationships, providing further evidence for the notion that service provider-consumer relationships can approximate friendships or even romantic partnerships in terms of loyalty-like responses. It also suggests that to identify truly loyal customers firms should, at the very least, measure loyalty-related outcomes from both dimensions. Research limitations/implications - The study was limited to consumer-based services. Originality/value - This paper identifies several manifestations of loyalty such as altruism, identification, advocacy, willingness to pay more, and strength of preference that are all-too-often ignored in commonly used marketing metrics. Viewing service loyalty in the same manner as pro-relationship behaviors that develop in friendships and romantic relationships shows promise for the understanding of service loyalty.","Customer loyalty; Customer relations; Interpersonal relations; Marketing theory; Services marketing","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-33847189547"

Recent advancements in technology have produced new, nonhuman alternatives to traditional celebrity endorsers. These new endorsers rely on artificial intelligence (AI) to interact with and influence consumers. Two studies demonstrate that AI influencers can produce positive brand benefits similar to those produced by human celebrity endorsers. Moreover, just like their human counterparts, AI influencers can also commit transgressions that result in degradation of the endorsed brand. Importantly, though, AI influencers differ from human celebrity endorsers in that consumers are less likely to view them as unique entities (as tested in a pilot study). Thus, consumers are more likely to perceive a transgression committed by an AI influencer as behavior applicable to all AI influencers, but they are less likely to view celebrity endorser behaviors as interchangeable. As such, after an AI influencer has committed a transgression, replacing the AI influencer with a celebrity endorser attenuates negative brand perceptions, an effect which cannot be realized if the replacement is another AI influencer. © Copyright © 2020, American Academy of Advertising.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85090954735"

Specifically, individual characteristics and product type are argued to differentially influence the weights that customers place on five different categories of usability. The weighted ratings of the five categories together determine use behavior and purchase behavior, after controlling for purchase need, experience with similar sites, and previous purchase on the specific sites. The model was tested in a longitudinal field study among 757 customers who provided usability assessments for multiple websites from four different industries - i.e., airlines, online bookstores, automobile manufacturers, and car rental agencies.

Design/methodology/approach – A random sample of US grocery consumers (N=454) was surveyed using a self-administered questionnaire. Descriptive and inferential statistical techniques (regression, ANOVA) were used to evaluate the data. Findings – Identifies demographic groups who frequent specific formats (specialty grocers, traditional supermarkets, supercenters, warehouse clubs, internet grocers) and examines store attributes (e.g. price competitiveness, product selection, and atmosphere) as drivers of format choice. Research limitations/implications – The results included in this research were gathered and reported on an individual format basis. In order to capture consumer choices across a range of grocery retail formats, forcing respondents to compare formats was not initiated. In addition, data pertaining to whether consumers had access to each and every type of format in the study were not collected. Examination of how dimensions of consumer access limit or expand retail patronage behavior could also be highly beneficial to grocery retailers. Practical implications – This research provides grocery retailers that operate within the USA specific knowledge of the attributes that consumers consider to be most important when making format choices (e.g. cleanliness, price competitiveness, product assortment, courtesy of personnel), and identifies the demographic characteristics of these consumers. The results suggest marketing strategy implications for grocery retailers that operate in the US market. As competition in the sector continues to evolve and consumer demographics change within the US market, understanding the consumer-format choice linkage will be critical to retailer performance in the industry.

The results of five studies suggest that the neglected Delboeuf illusion may explain how the size of dinnerware creates two opposing biases that lead people to overserve on larger plates and bowls and underserve on smaller ones. A countercyclical sinus-shaped relationship is shown to exist between these serving biases and the relative gap between the edge of the food and the edge of the dinnerware. Although these serving biases are difficult to eliminate with attention and education, changing the color of one's dinnerware or tablecloth may help attenuate them. By showing that the Delboeuf illusion offers a mechanistic explanation for how dinnerware size can bias serving and intake, we open new theoretical opportunities for linking illusions to eating behavior and suggest how simple changes in design can improve consumer welfare. © 2011 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc.

A value-based model is proposed and tested in a multinational study. Design/methodology/approach: An empirical investigation of 1,096 consumers was conducted in five nations with a different cultural profile on the two cultural dimensions in-group collectivism and assertiveness. The paper applies multi-group structural equation modelling to test the moderating effect of culture on the impact of pro-environmental values on attitudes and subjective norms. Findings: The study reveals that the influence of a pro-environmental value orientation differs substantially, according to national cultural values. While an ecocentric value orientation is important in the US, Canadian, German, and Australian samples which hold individualistic values, an anthropocentric value orientation is salient in the Russian sample, characterized by collectivistic values. The hypothesized influence of the national cultural value assertiveness, however, could not be established decisively. Research limitations/implications: First, the present study considers culture as a national value on an aggregated level. Future studies should take into account cultural values at different levels of aggregation. Second, since only one collectivistic society is the object of the investigation, the results are limited in terms of generalizability. Practical implications: In order to address the ecocentric value orientation in the analyzed individualistic societies, marketers should emphasize benefits for the environment in the USA, Canada, Australia, and Germany. By contrast, the positive consequences for humankind in general and future generations should be stressed in the collectivistic Russian sample. Originality/value: The paper contributes to the literature by integrating both individual and national perspectives on the value-based drivers of environmental concern. The study also provides insight into pro-environmental consumer behavior in an emerging market (namely Russia), which has so far been neglected in cross-cultural research. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Anthropocentric value orientation; Australia; Canada; Consumer behaviour; Ecocentric value orientation; Germany; In-group collectivism; National cultural values; Pro-environmental value orientation; Russia; Theory of planned behaviour; United States of America","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84867757637"

We predicted that regardless of their explicit intentions, consumers would repeat habits to purchase fast food, watch TV news, and take the bus. The results yielded the anticipated pattern in which participants repeated habitual behaviors even if they reported intentions to do otherwise. Intentions only guided behavior in the absence of strong habits. This study ruled out a number of artifactual accounts for these findings including that they arise from the level of abstraction at which intentions are identified, the certainty with which participants held intentions, a restriction of range in the measures, and the strategy participants used to estimate frequency of past performance.

A major threat to sustainability is the escalating demand for energy resulting in the depletion of natural resources and a concomitant threat to the global climate from the emissions produced. Although tourism and its sub-sectors, such as transport, accommodation, and attractions, constitute an increasingly important part of many economies, their contribution to energy use is not well researched. Particularly, in popular tourist destinations, such as New Zealand, tourism could be a significant contributor to energy consumption. As every tourist relies on the provision of accommodation, this is considered a core sub-sector within tourism. Previous case studies have indicated that accommodation is an energy-intense sector, however, comprehensive research on energy use patterns is missing. This paper contributes to the understanding of energy use within the accommodation sector by analysing the New Zealand scenario. The main objectives are the exploration of differences in energy consumption between hotel, bed and breakfast, motel, backpacker, and campground accommodation categories, and the role of factors such as business size in this consumption. Based on this analysis benchmarks are established for each category for total annual energy use and energy intensities, such as energy use per visitor night. When aggregated the total energy use of the accommodation sector in New Zealand is also estimated. The results reveal that hotels are the largest (net and per capita) energy consumers in the accommodation sector, making up 67% of the total 1.74 PJ consumed in 1999 in the accommodation sector. This constitutes 4.4% of the commercial sector's energy use and 0.4% of the total energy use in New Zealand. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

This research finds that the guests' assessment of the importance of being environmentally friendly has the greatest effect on their intention to stay in a green hotel. Second, the research identifies the following customer barriers to participation: inconvenience, perceptions of cost cutting, and decreased luxury-all of which significantly affect consumers' intention to stay at a green hotel or pay more for a room in such a hotel. Third, the results show that customers believe that hotels should have certain green practices, but did not consider it important to stay in a hotel that actually maintains the thirteen green practices tested here. Fourth, the results find that customers behave with greater environmental responsibility at home than they do in a hotel. Among the implications of these findings is the idea that hotel managers' communications and actions must be relevant to guests' concerns by educating customers, increasing convenience to participate in green programs, and decreasing perceptions of cost cutting. © The Author(s) 2013.","barriers to participation; eco-friendly attitudes; green hotels; hotel guest preferences","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84892896028"

Experimental economics literature, with its emphasis on incentive alignment and hypothetical blas, suggests that more realistic incentive-aligned studies result in stronger out-of-sample predictive performance of actual purchase behaviors and provide better estimates of consumer preference structures than do hypothetical studies. To test this hypothesis, the authors design an experiment with conventional (hypothetical) conditions and parallel incentive-aligned counterparts. Using Chinese dinner specials as the context, the authors conduct a field experiment in a Chinese restaurant during dinnertime. The results provide strong evidence in favor of incentive-aligned choice conjoint analysis, in that incentive-aligned choice conjoint outperforms hypothetical choice conjoint in out-of-sample predictions. To determine the robustness of the results, the authors conduct a second study that uses snacks as the context and considers only the choice treatments. This study confirms the results by providing strong evidence in favor of incentivealigned choice analysis in out-of-sample predictions. The results provide a strong motivation for conjoint practitioners to consider conducting studies in realistic settings using incentive structures that require participants to ""live with"" their decisions.","","","Review","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-14844283860"

Design/methodology/approach - Over 300 students and staff from a US university completed a survey regarding their online shopping and buying experiences for 17 products. Findings - The results show that, while older online shoppers search for significantly fewer products than their younger counterparts, they actually purchase as much as younger consumers. Attitudinal factors explained more variance in online searching behavior. Age explained more variance in purchasing behavior if the consumer had first searched for the product online. Research limitations/implications - The limitations of the present research are threefold. First, the sample was restricted to university faculty, staff and students. Second, a better measure of the hedonic motivation construct is needed. Third, additional independent measures such as income should be included to understand the additional demographic factors related to online purchase. Practical implications - Retailing managers can make use of the results as describing multifaceted nature of online shopping and buying behavior. Age differences (in both directions) were seen for many product categories. In addition, results indicate that how one measures online shopping impacts on one's understanding of age effects on internet shopping. Age was negatively correlated with online pre-purchase search but was positively correlated with online purchasing when pre-purchase search behavior was taken into account.

Policy interventions and academic discourse alike often assume that transforming consumption practices requires interventions that address people as consumers. This paper questions the assumption that the politics of consumption naturally implies a problematisation of consumer identities; it argues that this connection between consumption and consumers is a contingent achievement of strategically motivated actors with specific objectives in the public realm. This argument is developed through a case study of ethical consumption campaigning in the UK. Existing work in geography on alternative food networks, commodity chains and fair trade acknowledges the political intentions of such initiatives but also expresses unease about the registers of 'consumption', 'ethics' and 'responsibility' in which they are embedded. Focussing on the discursive interventions used in ethical consumption campaigns, we argue that these are not primarily aimed at encouraging generic consumers to recognise themselves for the first time as 'ethical' consumers. Rather, they aim to provide information to people already disposed to support or sympathise with certain causes; information that enables them to extend their concerns and commitments into everyday consumption practices. These acts of consumption are in turn counted, reported, surveyed and represented in the public realm by organisations that speak for the 'ethical consumer'. These campaigns also provide supporters and sympathisers with narrative storylines. We focus on one of these storylines, which re-inscribes popular discourses of globalisation into a narrative in which people are ascribed various responsibilities by virtue of their activities as consumers but also empowered to act ethically and politically in and through these activities. We conclude that ethical consumption campaigning is a political phenomenon in which everyday consumption practices are reconstituted as the sites for citizenly acts that reach beyond the realm of consumption per se. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The strong predilection for concrete reasoning and overreliance on pictographic information of functionally illiterate consumers suggest that companies should reconsider how they highlight the added benefits of new products or the differentiating aspects of existing product offerings across channels such as advertising, in-store displays, and positioning. Concrete reasoning also has strong implications for the execution and presentation of price promotions through coupons and in-store discounts, because many consumers are unable to process the information and thus avoid discounted products.

Young consumers contribute significantly to the outgrowth of e-waste problem as front-runners in the consumption, generation and management processes. Survey data have been analysed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) approach as a multivariate statistical method. The findings show that the integrated model can explain more than 47 per cent of the variance in the young consumers’ e-waste recycling intention which reflects good explanatory power and confirms its robustness. The role of recycling habits and perceived attitudes are demonstrated as strong predictors of young adults’ e-waste recycling intention. Surprisingly, constructs of the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) involving subjective norms and behavioural control show no significant influence on the e-waste recycling intention of young consumers. Building on these findings, e-waste recycling programs should first target attitudes and create specific cues that trigger habits. The paper also concludes with several social and practical implications that can foster e-waste recycling policies. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","e-waste; Emerging economy; Habits; Pro-environmental behaviour; Recycling; Theory of planned behaviour","Behavioral research; Least squares approximations; Multivariant analysis; Recycling; Wastes; Emerging economies; Explanatory power; Integrated modeling; Management process; Multivariate statistical method; Partial least square (PLS); Structural equation modelling; Theory of planned behaviour; Electronic Waste","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85091623742"

Besides the actual price, how the price offering is presented to consumers also affects consumer evaluation of the product offering. Many studies focus on ""price framing,"" i.e., how the offer is communicated to the consumer -is the offered price given along with a reference price, is the reference price plausible, is a price deal communicated in dollar or percentage terms. Other studies focus on ""situational effects,"" e.g., is the evaluation for a national brand or a private brand, is it within a discount store or a specialty store. In this article, a meta-analysis of 20 published articles in marketing examines the effects of price frames and situations on perceived savings. The results reveal many features that significantly influence perceived savings. For instance, while both the percent of deal and the amount of deal positively influence perceived deal savings, deal percent has more impact. Further, the presence of a regular price as an external reference price enhances the offer value of large plausible deal and implausible deals, but not of small plausible deals. Thus, high value deals should announce the regular price, but not low value deals. Overall, the results have several useful insights for designing promotions. © 2002 by New York University.

Such crises can cause major revenue and marketshare losses, lead to costly product recalls, and destroy carefully nurtured brand equity. Moreover, some of these effects may spill over to nonaffected competitors in the category when they are perceived to be guilty by association. The extant literature lacks generalizable knowledge on the effectiveness of different marketing adjustments that managers often consider to mitigate the consequences of such events. To fill this gap, the authors use large household-scanner panels to analyze 60 fast-moving consumer good product crises that occurred in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands and resulted in the full recall of an entire variety. The authors assess the effects of postcrisis advertising and price adjustments on the change in consumers' brand share and category purchases. In addition, they consider the extent to which the effects are moderated by two key crisis characteristics: the extent of negative publicity surrounding the event and whether the affected brand had to publicly acknowledge blame. Using the empirical findings, the authors provide context-specific managerial recommendations on how to overcome a product-harm crisis. © 2013, American Marketing Association.","Blame; Defective product; Negative publicity; Product recall; Product-harm crisis; Purchase behavior","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84874591833"

Extending recent research on store choice, they add assortments as a predictor, specify a general structure for heterogeneity, and estimate store choice and category needs models simultaneously. Using household-level market basket data, the authors find that, in general, assortments are more important than retail prices in store choice decisions. They find that the number of brands offered in retail assortments has a positive effect on store choice for most households, while the number of stockkeeping units per brand, sizes per brand, and proportion of stockkeeping units that are unique to the store (a proxy for presence of private labels) have a negative effect on store choice for most households. They also find more heterogeneity in response to assortment than to either convenience or price. Therefore, optimal assortments depend on the particular preferences of a retailer's shoppers. Finally, the authors find a correlation in household-level responses to assortment and travel distance (r = .43), which suggests that the less important an assortment is to a consumer's store choices, the more the consumer values convenience, and vice versa. © 2009, American Marketing Association.","Assortment; Random effects; Retail; Shopping behavior; Store choice","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-64749113692"

Some commentators have speculated that this new market phenomenon is a result of government intervention, consumer ethnocentrism, and improvement in the quality of local products. In this study, the authors offer an alternative reason, which pertains to the fading symbolic value of foreign products in the PRC market. To provide support for their argument, Zhou and Hui present the results of a study of Chinese consumption behaviors involving a foreign, inconspicuous product item (Canadian pork sausage). By using such a privately consumed item, the authors attempt to demonstrate that symbolic benefits (such as modernity, prestige, and associations with foreign lifestyles) constitute one of the primary motivating forces of PRC consumers' purchases of products of nonlocal origin, including products that may not be commonly regarded as conspicuous. The results challenge the conventional wisdom that improvement in the quality of local products is the main cause of the decreasing competitiveness of foreign products in the PRC.

Yet recently, a competing perspective has emerged suggesting that COO effects have been inflated in prior research and even that the COO concept has become irrelevant. The purpose of this paper is to reconcile these two competing perspectives by examining the effects of individual brand origin perceptions. Design/methodology/approach – The conceptual framework is grounded in consumers’ learning. Empirically, the authors’ hypotheses are tested using hierarchical linear modeling on a sample of 4,047 brand evaluations by 544 consumers. Findings – The results provide strong evidence that product country image of the consumer's perceived brand origin strongly affects brand attitudes, and this happens regardless of the perceptions’ objective accuracy. The authors also find evidence that educating consumers about brands’ true COO can contribute to changes in brand attitudes. Practical implications – It is concluded that suggestions that COO has become an irrelevant construct in international marketing may be premature. The study offers meaningful insights for managers in understanding how brands’ country associations affect brand attitudes. Originality/value – This study aims to reconcile tensions in the current COO literature and does so by demonstrating that although consumer knowledge of brand origin is often mis-calibrated, consumers’ perceptions of brand origin still matter. © 2011, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Brand evaluation; Brand origin recognition accuracy; Consumer behaviour; Country of origin; Global branding; Global marketing; Hierarchical linear modelling","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-80052592963"

All subjects perceived at least some ethical issues in relation to animal production systems, in particular, systems keeping animals in close confinement. Welfare-friendly production systems were viewed as adding value to a food, but this value was not necessarily realizable to producers if purchases occurred only when foods were on special offer. Statements made by individuals were often contradictory, revealing ambivalence, unresolved value conflicts and a general lack of involvement in the nature of meat production. A number of barriers to the establishment of stable attitudes and behaviours in relation to the ethical treatment of food animals were also identified. A key finding of the study is that individuals can hold two views on animal welfare. On the one hand, they may think as citizens influencing societal standards, and on the other, as consumers at the point of purchase. As citizens, they support the notion of animals being entitled to a good life; as meat consumers, they avoid the cognitive connection with the live animal. This paper explores both the citizen–consumer relationship and purchase strategies used by consumers to resolve value conflicts. Lessons for public and commercial policy are highlighted in the context of the Curry Report (2002) which advocates more effective market segmentation where markets are finely attuned to their customers, with the development of a number of assurance schemes discussed in the article. © 2017 Wiley.

At the retrospective level, we propose that while the expected direct relationship between satisfaction and positive emotions will emerge, the equally expected inverse relationship between negative emotions and satisfaction will be found only for negative emotions attributed to the service provider. Negative emotions attributed to causes other than the provider (i.e. to the situation or to oneself) may be positively associated with satisfaction. At the in-process level, we propose that the experience of distinct emotions at a certain stage of the service may influence the consumer's expectations for and perceptions of the provider performance, and/or the expressions and behaviors of the consumer himself and those of the provider in the subsequent episode. Such in-process effects of emotions will then determine their relationship with post-purchase satisfaction.

In order to contribute to the current debate on this topic, this research paper aims to assess, through a quantitative analysis, whether the knowledge, awareness and information that consumers gather on the environmental impact of a product through an eco-label can stimulate an eco-friendly behavior. Moreover, we assess whether general attitudes in purchasing behaviors determine a personal attitude toward ecological consumption. The findings from this study, which is based on a large dataset of Italian consumers, highlight a significant role of eco-labels in increasing the consumer's perceived behavioral control, unlike loyalty in brand and in store, which do not exert a significant influence.

In this article, the author argues that external validity concerns should be given more attention, particularly in TA research. Three recommendations are made for implementing these concerns: (1) consumer behavior articles should be required to have a section indicating how increased levels of external validity can be obtained with other studies, (2) ""joint ventures"" between consumer behavior and marketing science researchers can be profitable and should be encouraged, and (3) analyses of electronic scanner panel data or other secondary data can be used to generate higher levels of external validity. Three examples are given from the marketing literature of how findings from experiments and scanner data can be combined to advance a stream of research.

The central argument of this paper is that the strength of the effect of these variables on attitudinal brand loyalty will vary with the level of customer experience with purchasing the service. Building on previous research which examined low-risk, customer product settings [Kim, J., Lim, J.S., & Bhargava, M. (1998).

Heart and mind in conflict: The interplay of affect and cognition in consumer decision-making. Journal of Consumer Research 26: 278], this study shows that for a high-risk setting, involvement with the service category will be more dominant in its influence on brand loyalty than satisfaction with the preferred brand. Furthermore, it was found that experience moderated the influence of involvement and satisfaction on attitudinal brand loyalty for a high-risk business-to-business service. This study provides new insights into the theory and practice of buyer behavior and business-to-business brands. Crown Copyright © 2004 Published by Elsevier Inc.

However, measuring R&D performance and assigning the same level of importance to different R&D measures, which is the common approach in existing studies, can oversimplify the R&D measuring process, which may result in misinterpretation of the performance and consequently fallacy R&D strategies. The aim of this study is to measure R&D performance taking into account the different levels of importance of R&D measures, using a multi-criteria decision-making method called Best Worst Method (BWM) to identify the weights (importance) of R&D measures and measure the R&D performance of 50 high-tech SMEs in the Netherlands using the data gathered in a survey among SMEs and from R&D experts. The results show how assigning different weights to different R&D measures (in contrast to simple mean) results in a different ranking of the firms and allow R&D managers to formulate more effective strategies to improve their firm's R&D performance by applying knowledge regarding the importance of different R&D measures. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Best worst method (BWM); R&D measures; R&D performance; Small-to-medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)","Commerce; Consumer Behavior; Efficiency, Organizational; Evaluation Studies as Topic; Financial Management; Humans; Netherlands; Organizational Innovation; Research; Netherlands; comparative advantage; industrial development; industrial performance; knowledge; multicriteria analysis; productivity; research and development; small and medium-sized enterprise; decision making; human; manager; Netherlands; commercial phenomena; consumer attitude; evaluation study; financial management; organization; organization and management; research; standards","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85032362842"

Also, customers use social media to gain information on preferred products with the best price options, as social media provides shoppers a voice, and facilitate them to interact and share their opinion worldwide. Moreover, social media is extensively adopted platform for e-commerce. Although, social media marketing has achieved wide acceptance in business, especially in e-commerce, there is no scale in the extant literature to measure perceived social media marketing activities (SMMA) in an e-commerce context. Therefore, this study develops and validates a 15-item, five-dimensional scale for measuring perceived SMMA of e-commerce based on extant literature on e-commerce and social media marketing and five different studies conducted in this research. The scale revealed comprehensive psychometric characteristics as per the results from the diverse reliability and validity checks. It was revealed that perceived SMMA positively influenced purchase intention and brand equity; which endorses the nomological validity of the developed scale. The new scale provides both theoretical as well as managerial implications along with the avenues for forthcoming research. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","e-Commerce; e-Shopping; Scale development; Social media; Social media marketing","Consumer behavior; Electronic commerce; Marketing; Social networking (online); Consumer perception; E-commerce context; Managerial implications; Purchase intention; Reliability and validity; Scale development; Social media; Social media marketings; Commerce","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85020454884"

Design/methodology/approach: To achieve this objective 240 online interviews were carried out (response rate 24 percent) from a randomly generated sample of 1,052 online shoppers using the database of a leading Internet provider in Greece as the sample frame. Findings: Data analysis involved the comparison of three rival models using structural equations modeling. The prevailed model reveals that e-service quality has a positive effect on e-satisfaction, while it also influences, both directly and indirectly through e-satisfaction, the consumer's behavioral intentions, namely site revisit, word-of-mouth communication and repeat purchase. Research limitations/implications: The results confirm that cognitive evaluations precede emotional responses and that quality is a strong antecedent of satisfaction. However, the findings highlight the importance of the interaction experience with the e-shop on perceived quality. Moreover, the study underlines the crucial impact of the four key e-service quality drivers on the entire cycle of buying, including post-purchase behavior, confirming existing evidence in both off- and on-line context. Practical implications: Practitioners should carefully consider their web site's attributes. They should make their sites easy-to-use and easy-to-navigate and place extra emphasis on providing fast, accurate, and uncluttered information through their web sites. Also they should direct marketing activities with the aim to enhance satisfaction from e-shopping, particularly regarding the service encounter incidents. Originality/value: The paper makes a scholar contribution by examining the notion of e-service quality and how it relates with e-satisfaction while exploring unexamined consumers' behavioral intentions and both their direct and indirect antecedents. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Consumer behaviour; Customer satisfaction; Customer services quality; Electronic commerce; Retailing","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-77951468001"

Four quality signaling mechanisms are at work: (1) price signals quality, (2) advertising frequency signals quality, (3) advertising content provides direct (but noisy) information about quality, and (4) use experience provides direct (but noisy) information about quality. We estimate our proposed model using scanner panel data on ketchup. If price is important as a signal of brand quality, then frequent price promotion may have the unintended consequence of reducing brand equity. We use our estimated model to measure the importance of such effects. Our results imply that price is an important quality-signaling mechanism and that frequent price cuts can have significant adverse effects on brand equity. The role of advertising frequency in signaling quality is also significant, but it is less quantitatively important than price. © 2008 INFORMS.","Advertising and price as signals of quality; Bayesian learning; Brand equity; Consumer choice under uncertainty; Dynamic choice; Pricing policy; Signaling","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-60949095189"

Empowered by new technological possibilities, an individual consumer can now wreak havoc on a brand with relatively little effort. In reflection of this new phenomenon, the authors introduce the concept of consumer brand sabotage (CBS). On the basis of different underlying motives, a conceptual framework distinguishes CBS (a form of hostile aggression: harming the brand as dominant motive) from other forms of negative consumer behavior, such as customer retaliation and negative word of mouth (instrumental aggression: harming a brand is only a means to achieve other objectives, e.g., restoring equity). This framework adapts insights from aggression and appraisal theories as well as qualitative interviews with actual saboteurs to a consumer-brand relationship context in order to develop an improved theoretical understanding of the under-researched phenomenon of CBS. The authors analyze the mental escalation processes of individual consumers toward CBS and develop a road map for future research. © 2016, American Marketing Association.","Brand management; Consumer brand sabotage; Consumer-brand relationships; Marketing theory; Relationship breakdown","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84973896960"

Today, social media sites like Facebook offer the possibility of electronic word of mouth (eWOM), a mediated form of WOM. Little is known about the best way for marketers to use social media. Even less is known about international differences in consumer usage of social media and how eWOM influences consumer decision-making. This study helps address that research gap and uses cultural dimensions to compare the use of social media and other information sources for consumer decision-making across 50 countries. The results indicate that the use of information sources that influence online purchase decisions strongly varies by culture. For example, relationship-oriented collectivists rely to a greater extent than individualists on social media, which are an alternative for interpersonal WOM communication. Interestingly culture affects the influence of social media on purchases differently than the influence of traditional WOM through family or friends. Furthermore, there are major differences in online complaint behavior by country, due to cultural variations. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","collectivism; culture; individualism; online; purchase; social media; word of mouth","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84891024193"

If the failure occurs infrequently or the company is not responsible, compensation does not affect repurchase intentions.

A wide variety of WEEE is discarded by consumers, often in different ways depending on size with small items (e.g. toasters) being easier to dispose of than larger ones (e.g. washing machines). Currently, small WEEE is not treated as a priority waste stream in the UK as in order to meet targets under the WEEE Directive2 (CEC, 2003c) it makes more sense to focus on larger items for which collection, reuse and recycling systems already exist, but small items need to be tackled for a number of reasons, including the long term strategic development of infrastructure. In light of this, the paper will assess consumer attitudes towards the disposal of small WEEE, and identify key problems raised by the implementation of the WEEE Directive in relation to these small product groups. The findings from a large scale postal questionnaire, and semi-structured interviews conducted in Cardiff, Wales will be used, and key literature and research carried out to date on the disposal of WEEE, and household attitudes to waste and recycling will be assessed. It will also look at how the implementation of the WEEE Directive 'fits in' with the current transition in the UK towards more sustainable waste management practices at the household level, and then explore the most effective ways of engaging householders in the recycling of small WEEE. Key recommendations will then be outlined concerning the future strategic development and practical implementation of the WEEE Directive in relation to consumer involvement and small product types. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Digital technologies, however, have created new forms of ""electronic word-of-mouth,"" which offer new potential for gathering credible information that guides consumer behaviors. We conducted a nationally representative survey and a focused experiment to assess how individuals perceive the credibility of online commercial information, particularly as compared to information available through more traditional channels, and to evaluate the specific aspects of ratings information that affect people's attitudes toward ecommerce. Survey results show that consumers rely heavily on web-based information as compared to other channels, and that ratings information is critical in the evaluation of the credibility of online commercial information. Experimental results indicate that ratings are positively associated with perceptions of product quality and purchase intention, but that people attend to average product ratings, but not to the number of ratings or to the combination of the average and the number of ratings together. Thus suggests that in spite of valuing the web and ratings as sources of commercial information, people use ratings information suboptimally by potentially privileging small numbers of ratings that could be idiosyncratic. In addition, product quality is shown to mediate the relationship between user ratings and purchase intention. The practical and theoretical implications of these findings are considered for ecommerce scholars, consumers, and vendors. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Amazon; Credibility; Ecommerce; Electronic word of mouth; Information credibility; Product quality; Product ratings; Purchase intention; User ratings; User-generated content","Consumer behavior; Purchasing; Quality control; Risk perception; Sales; Surveys; Amazon; Credibility; Electronic word of mouth; Information credibilities; Product ratings; Products quality; Purchase intention; User rating; User-generated; User-generated content; Electronic commerce","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84895182776"

A time-elapsed three-stage survey was used to evaluate the respondents and any changes over time. Findings - In a survey of 407 match attendees, emotionally-based satisfaction was found to be a better predictor of future behavioural intention than cognitive measures of satisfaction.

By contrast, when appeals arousing high levels of fear are ineffective, it is because too much elaboration on the harmful consequences interferes with processing of the recommended change in behavior. We find support for these expectations in the context of a communication advocating that people stop smoking. The elaboration-enhancing interventions used, self-reference and imagery processing, increased the persuasiveness of a low-fear appeal by prompting elaboration on the harmful consequences of smoking, whereas the use of two elaboration-suppressing interventions, reference to others and objective processing, increased the persuasiveness of a high-fear appeal by decreasing the extent to which consumers deny harmful consequences.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0041526227"

This paper investigates how the presence of social learning affects the strategic interaction between a dynamic-pricing monopolist and a forward-looking consumer population, within a simple two-period model. Our analysis yields three main insights. First, we find that the presence of social learning has significant structural implications for optimal pricing policies: In the absence of social learning, decreasing price plans are always preferred by the firm; by contrast, in the presence of social learning we find that (i) if the firm commits to a price path ex ante (preannounced pricing), an increasing price plan is typically announced, whereas (ii) if the firm adjusts price dynamically (responsive pricing), prices are initially low and may either rise or decline over time. Second, we establish that under both preannounced and responsive pricing, even though the social learning process exacerbates strategic consumer behavior (i.e., increases strategic purchasing delays), its presence results in an increase in expected firm profit. Third, we illustrate that, contrary to results reported in existing literature on strategic consumer behavior, in settings where social learning is significantly influential, preannounced pricing policies are generally not beneficial for the firm. © 2016 INFORMS.","Applied game theory; Bayesian social learning; Dynamic pricing; Strategic consumer behavior","Costs; Game theory; Serious games; Structural optimization; Dynamic pricing; Forward looking; Optimal pricing; Product reviews; Purchasing decisions; Social learning; Strategic consumer behaviors; Strategic interactions; Consumer behavior","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85017321448"

Currently, pollution from plastics, packaging-related waste, declining air, soil, and water quality, climate change, and other contemporary challenges are influencing the packaging industry. Barriers such as value chain complexities and negative consumer attitudes due to the economic, social, and environmental demands of sustainable behaviors can discourage companies from the implementation of more sustainable packaging. Hence, packages with improved sustainability may never make their way into the marketplace. However, the next generation of sustainable solutions can be motivated by efforts that fuel a positive consumer attitude towards sustainable packaging. In order to direct efforts, a clear understanding of consumer dynamics in ecological material preferences, willingness to pay, recycling, and factors impacting sustainable behaviors are essential. The objective of this work is to (i) explore the definitions, the impact of sustainable packaging in the value chain, and consumer behavior theories; (ii) review current practices, factors affecting sustainable behaviors, and consumer testing methods; (iii) present three distinct case studies on consumer preferences and value perceptions on bio-based cellulose materials and the impact of on-label claims and pre-evaluation education in consumer preferences; and (iv) to reveal the research gaps and opportunities for consumer research and suggest strategies for stakeholders to communicate packaging sustainability to consumers. © 2020 by the authors.

With this goal in mind, a questionnaire survey was performed on a nationwide scale to explore consumers' behaviours, attitudes and willingness to pay (WTP) for recycling waste mobile phones. There were 1035 effective questionnaires, and the questionnaire was analysed with principal component analysis and multinomial logistic regression analysis. The results revealed that the actual service life of mobile phones in China is generally shorter than three years. Due to the current level of economic development and the traditional concept, only 47.9% of consumers agreed to pay for waste mobile phone recycling, and most consumers' WTP was 0-5% of the recycling costs. The main factors affecting the consumers' WTP were region, education level and monthly income. Therefore, mobile phone producers and the government should mostly share the responsibility of waste mobile phone recycling. With an improvement in public environmental awareness, it may be possible for consumers to afford recycling fees in the future, through either a prepaid deposit, or purchasing the product with the fee embedded in the price.

In line with our predictions, two experiments show that smell can impact touch in meaningful ways. Specifically, we show that multisensory semantic congruence between smell and touch properties of a stimulus enhances haptic perception and product evaluation. We explore this relationship in the context of two properties of touch, namely texture and temperature, and demonstrate that both smell and touch can have semantic associations, which can affect haptic perception and product evaluation depending on whether they match or not. In study 1, we focus on the semantic association of smell and touch (texture) with gender and in study 2 with temperature. Our results extend prior work on smell and touch within consumer behavior, and further contribute to emerging literature on multisensory interactions. © 2010.","Semantic congruence; Sensory aesthetics; Sensory perception; Smell; Touch","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-77956610590"

The model was introduced by Petty and Cacioppo over three decades ago and has been modified, revised and extended. Given modern communication contexts, it is appropriate to question the model’s validity and relevance. Design/methodology/approach - The authors develop a conceptual approach, based on a fully comprehensive and extensive review and critique of ELM and its development since its inception. Findings - This paper focuses on major issues concerning the ELM. These include model assumptions and its descriptive nature; continuum questions, multi-channel processing and mediating variables before turning to the need to replicate the ELM and to offer recommendations for its future development. Research limitations/implications - This paper offers a series of questions in terms of research implications. These include whether ELM could or should be replicated, its extension, a greater conceptualization of argument quality, an explanation of movement along the continuum and between central and peripheral routes to persuasion, or to use new methodologies and technologies to help better understanding consume thinking and behaviour? All these relate to the current need to explore the relevance of ELM in a more modern context. Practical implications - It is time to question the validity and relevance of the ELM. The diversity of on- and off-line media options and the variants of consumer choice raise significant issues. Originality/value - While the ELM model continues to be widely cited and taught as one of the major cornerstones of persuasion, questions are raised concerning its relevance and validity in 21st century communication contexts. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Advertising theory; Communications context; Elaboration likelihood; Multi-channel processing; Persuasion","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84928160379"

Design/methodology/approach: A volume of 146 peer-reviewed journal articles were retrieved from two major databases. Content analysis of this academic research has been performed, exploring the effects of online reviews on tourism consumers and providers. Findings: The content analysis identified three main research themes that were investigated by scholars and classified into two major categories, namely, consumer perspective and provider perspective: the antecedents (factors motivating and influencing tourists); the influence of online reviews on consumer behaviour; and the impact of these reviews on tourism businesses (providers’ perspective). Research limitations/implications: This study is based on a literature review and outcomes reported by previous studies; hence, the suggestions are indicative rather than conclusive. Some publication sources were not included. Practical implications: This paper suggests a range of adequate strategies, along with operational actions, formulated for industry practitioners in the fields of management and marketing.

To date few studies explored the interplay between information, pre-existing environmental concern and barriers to the purchase of green products. By analyzing the data from a survey to a large sample of Italian consumers (n = 8001), we advanced 6 hypotheses to explain the main drivers behind consumers’ selection of sustainable products. Attitudes towards green products were the main predictors of green product purchasing and were influenced by consumer's attitudes towards ecolabels, whose marginal effect varied according to the level of individual environmental concern. Our study provides evidence that ecolabels can play a significant role in attitude formation about green products, interacting with environmental concern. Therefore, we suggest future studies about green consumer profiling based on how consumers access and integrate information in decision-making, to improve green marketing campaigns.

Both are achieved by the protective function of the packaging against negative ambient influences such as mechanical damage, light or water vapour. Material, form and concepts of packaging vary widely, which thus also differentiates the environmental impact for packaging. This paper provides an overview of the current research of European consumer perception and how this correlates with the environmental impact of loose foodstuffs and packaged food. Considered materials are plastic, glass, metal, and paper/cardboard. These perceptions are compared to the objective environmentally friendliness based on the selected assessment criteria carbon footprint, recycling rate, reuse rate and biological degradation/decomposition in Europe. The purpose of this paper is to discover whether there is any link between the consumer perception and the scientific assessed environmental sustainability. Consumers judge packaging material by criteria of circular economy, natural looking material, and design. The environmental impact of paper/cardboard and metal are rated in line with the scientific measure by consumers, whereas plastic packaging is underestimated and glass and biodegradable plastic packaging are highly overestimated. These results indicate that the rating of European consumers and scientific life cycle assessments turn out differently. The differences are mainly linked by theoretical concepts of recyclability, biodegradability, and reuse rate of the packaging. Consumers evaluate food packaging by affective feelings than using cognitive reasoning. Their knowledge about the practical implementation of recyclability, biodegradability and reusability as well as additional environmental impact factors are low. Consequently, consumers’ buying behaviour is in most cases less environmentally sustainable than intended. Awareness trainings based on scientific facts, clear product and packaging information based on labelling schemes (“eco-labelling”) and nudging for sustainable behaviour can potentially support consumers in their sustainable buying behaviour. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Beverages; Consumer behaviour; Consumer perception; Environmental impact; Packaging; Sustainability","Beverages; Biodegradability; Glass; Life Cycle; Packaging Machines; Beverages; Biodegradability; Biodegradable polymers; Carbon footprint; Cardboard; Consumer behavior; Environmental impact; Glass; Life cycle; Packaging; Packaging machines; Packaging materials; Reusability; Supply chains; Ambients; Buying behavior; Consumer perception; Food packaging; Food-safety; Mechanical damages; Plastic packaging; Protective function; Recyclability; Reuse; Sustainable development","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85103370533"

Therefore, we propose that the term engagement should be eluded and that more specific terms should be used for the different phenomena. Building on the previous literature, we propose the customer engagement ecosystem, a conceptual model that encompasses brand actions, other actors, customer brand experience, shopping behaviours, brand consumption and brand-dialogue behaviours. The model posits that interactions between these elements are non-linear and reactive; meaning that each action causes a reaction of not only the intended recipient of the message, but the whole ecosystem. Hence, the model reflects the interconnected character of today’s marketing environment. It also recognises the growing importance of empowered consumers by distinguishing different forms of brand dialogue behaviours, which describe customers’ non-purchase focused behaviours. © 2016 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","brand; brand dialogue behaviours; Customer engagement; customer experiences; engagement ecosystem; non-purchase behaviours","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84958539756"

With an increasing vehicle fleet worldwide private car use is becoming an acute problem in need of urgent attention and action. Policy interference and cleaner cars are not enough; alternative fuel vehicles such as electric vehicles need to be adopted by consumers as well. Previous research on pro-environmental consumer behavior and sustainable consumption has proven the importance of norms and pro-environmental attitudes. However, little research has focused on understanding interpersonal influence found influential in consumer behavior research relating to innovation adoption. Consumer opinion leading and opinion seeking are two such interpersonal influence attitudinal constructs that have not been empirically analyzed in relation to sustainable consumption and alternative fuel vehicles. The main aim of this study is thus to analyze the influence of a set of attitudinal constructs on electric and flexfuel vehicle adoption: personal norms, social norms, ecological attitudes, opinion leading, and opinion seeking. Data from a questionnaire survey on three groups of electric vehicle adopters and non-adopters is used (N = 1192). The results confirm the importance of personal norms, opinion leading and opinion seeking in the three groups also when controlling for socio-demographic factors. The main contribution of this study is that it shows the importance of both interpersonal influence and attitudinal factors as drivers for eco-innovation adoption. The study also contributes in showing that electric vehicle and flexfuel vehicle adopters differ in relation to non-adopters on several factors. © 2017 The Authors","Consumer behavior; Eco-innovation adoption; Electric vehicles; Flexfuel vehicles; Interpersonal influence; Sustainable consumption","Alternative fuels; Behavioral research; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Electric automobiles; Electric vehicles; Fleet operations; Global warming; Surveys; Sustainable development; Vehicles; Alternative fuel vehicles; Carbon dioxide emissions; Eco-innovation; Environmental attitudes; Flex-fuel; Interpersonal influences; Socio-demographic factors; Sustainable consumption; Consumer behavior","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85018553814"

We estimate consumers' willingness-to-pay and compensating variation (CV) for improvements in vehicle attributes, also taking taste differences in the population into account by applying a latent class model with 6 distinct consumer segments. Our results indicate that about 1/3 of the consumers are oriented towards at least one AFV option, with almost half of them being AFV-affine, showing a high probability of choosing AFVs despite their current shortcomings. Our results suggest that German car buyers' willingness-to-pay for improvements of the various vehicle attributes varies considerably across consumer groups and that the vehicle features have to meet some minimum requirements for considering AFVs. The CV values show that decision-makers in the administration and industry should focus on the most promising consumer group of 'AFV aficionados' and their needs. It also shows that some vehicle attribute improvements could increase the demand for AFVs cost-effectively, and that consumers would accept surcharges for some vehicle attributes at a level which could enable their private provision and economic operation (e.g. fast-charging infrastructure). Improvement of other attributes will need governmental subsidies to compensate for insufficient consumer valuation (e.g. battery capacity). © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Compensating variation; Discrete choice; Electric mobility; Latent class model; Stated preferences","Germany; Alternative fuels; Decision making; Energy efficiency; Fast charging (Batteries); Compensating variation; Discrete choice; Electric mobility; Latent class model; Stated preferences; alternative fuel; consumption behavior; discrete choice analysis; electric vehicle; numerical model; willingness to pay; Vehicles","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84955437727"

In this regard, this study presents a model of electric car adoption intention, in which personal values determine green self-identity, which in turn influences consumer intention to adopt electric cars directly and also indirectly via ethical motives of ecological care and moral obligation. Second, this work explores how personal values moderate the relationships between green self-identity, ecological care, moral obligation and electric car adoption intention. Data were collected through a survey in a sample of 2005 car drivers residing in Belgium, Denmark and Italy. Results confirm that four value domains (i.e., self-transcendence, self-enhancement, openness-to-change and conservation) influence green self-identity, which in turn determines consumer intention to adopt electric cars both directly and indirectly via ecological care and moral obligation motivations. Furthermore, consumers who find self-transcendent and openness-to-change values important tend to express their green self-identity directly into intentions and through moral obligation evaluations. Conversely, individuals who find self-enhancement values important express their green self-identity directly into intentions, while they take the ecological and moral considerations to behave green less into account. Finally, consumers who find conservation values important translate their green self-identity less into intentions to adopt electric cars, and tend to consider less the ecological and moral aspects of consumption choices. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Ecological care; Electric car adoption; Green self-identity; Moral obligation; Personal values","Belgium; Denmark; Italy; conservation planning; consumption behavior; ecological economics; electric vehicle; ethics; questionnaire survey; research method","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85019085135"

Therefore, the aim of this research was to examine the factors affecting consumers’ PEBs in Saudi Arabia. Quantitative data (n = 613) were collected using a survey method. The proposed conceptual model and associated hypotheses were tested using structural equation modelling. The results revealed that consumers’ intentions to adopt direct- and indirect-PEBs are affected by innovativeness, materialism, perceived consumer effectiveness, and environmental concern, but not by social influence.

This research assembles a unique matched sample of household data from the Survey of Consumer Finance and the Consumer Expenditure Survey to estimate the consumption effects of financial and housing wealth. The micro-data permit numerous innovations in the assessment of wealth effects, including an analysis of the impact of wealth on both durable and non-durable consumption and a comparison of wealth effects as derive from gross versus after-debt measures of financial and housing wealth. Further, the research seeks to assess robustness of those estimates to deviations from trend and volatility in financial and housing wealth and among credit constrained and non-credit constrained households. Overall, research findings indicate relatively large housing wealth effects. Among homeowners, the housing wealth elasticities are estimated in the range of .06 over the 1989-2001 period. In marked contrast, the estimated elasticities of consumption spending with respect to financial wealth are smaller in magnitude and are in the range of .02. Further, the estimated wealth elasticities appear robust to deviations from trend and volatility in the wealth measures. Research findings support the hypothesized behavioral distinction in household consumption spending across durable versus non-durable categories. Consumption propensities also diverge sharply across the credit constrained and non-credit constrained households. Finally, there is little difference in wealth elasticities derived from measures of home equity versus house values. Research findings suggest the possibility of sizable reverse wealth effects. For example, a 10 percent decline in housing wealth from 2005 levels translates into a 1 percentage point decline in real GDP growth, a sizable reduction relative to the approximate 4 percent real GDP growth evidenced in prior years. Results of the analysis point to the sizable economy-wide risks associated with the recent retrenchment in house values. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Arranging this field of ethical consumption research according to key research objectives, theoretical approaches, methods, and study population, the review suggests that most studies apply social psychological approaches focusing mainly on consumer attitudes. Fewer studies draw on economic approaches focusing on consumers' willingness to pay ethical premia for FT products or sociological approaches relying on the concept of consumer identity. Experimental, qualitative and conventional survey methods are used approximately equally often. Almost all studies draw on convenience or purposive samples and most studies are conducted in the USA or the United Kingdom. Several problems in current research are identified: amongst others, studies' rather narrow theoretical focus, potential hypothetical and social desirability bias of conventional survey data, and a lack of generalizability of empirical findings. In turn, we suggest that research would benefit from both a multiple-motives and a multiple-methods perspective. Considering competing theories can help to single out key behavioral determinants of individual FT consumption. The combination of different methods such as conventional surveys and field experiments contributes to uncovering respondents' truthful answers and improves generalizability of results. Scholars in the field of ethical consumption research should use experiments to detect causal relations proposed by theories and conduct cross-country surveys to gather insights as to how differences in market structures, cultural traits, and other path dependencies affect patterns of individual FT consumption. © 2011 The Author(s).","Choice experiment; Ethical consumption; Fair Trade consumption; Field experiment; Theory of planned behavior","","Review","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84859218775"

Moreover, it is time-consuming to manually label huge amounts of driving data due to uncertainties of driver behavior and variances among the data analysts. To address this problem, a semisupervised approach, a semisupervised support vector machine (S3VM), is employed to classify drivers into aggressive and normal styles based on a few labeled data points. First, a few data clusters are selected and manually labeled using a k-means clustering method. Then, a specific differentiable surrogate of a loss function is developed, which makes it feasible to use standard optimization tools to solve the nonconvex optimization problem.

Finally, we compare the S3VM method with a support vector machine method for classifying driving styles from different amounts of labeled data. Experiments show that the S3VM method can improve the classification accuracy by about 10% and reduce the labeling effort by using only a few labeled data clusters among huge amounts of unlabeled data. © 2013 IEEE.","Driving style classification; longitudinal driving behavior; nonconvex optimization; quasi-Newton (QN) methods; semisupervised support vector machine (S3VM)","Behavioral research; Cluster analysis; Consumer behavior; Optimization; Support vector machines; Vectors; Driving styles; Longitudinal driving; Nonconvex optimization; Quasi-Newton methods; Semi-supervised; Classification (of information)","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85028505671"

Recognizing this, public policies often pair competition with easy access to comparative information. The implicit assumption is that comparison friction-the wedge between the availability of comparative information and consumers' use of it-is inconsequential because when information is readily available, consumers will access this information and make effective choices. We examine the extent of comparison friction in the market for Medicare Part D prescription drug plans in the United States. In a randomized field experiment, an intervention group received a letter with personalized cost information. That information was readily available for free and widely advertised. However, this additional step-providing the information rather than having consumers actively access it-had an impact. Plan switching was 28% in the intervention group, versus 17% in the comparison group, and the intervention caused an average decline in predicted consumer cost of about $100 a year among letter recipients-roughly 5% of the cost in the comparison group. Our results suggest that comparison friction can be large even when the cost of acquiring information is small and may be relevant for a wide range of public policies that incorporate consumer choice. © Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the President and Fellows of HarvardCollege 2012.","","United States; comparative study; consumption behavior; cost; drug prescribing; experimental study; health insurance; social policy","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84856956988"

The present research examines both the multidimensionality of the involvement construct and its origins in sport spectator research. A team sport involvement (TSI) model is introdueed that account for antecedents of motivation, arousal, and interest related to a professional sport team. A series of focus groups and a pilot test were used to develop and refine the Sport Interest Inventory (SII) that measures 18 distinct antecedents of involvement. The SII was next administered to a random sample of season ticket holders and single game attendees of a sport team N = 1,600). Confirmatory factor analysis confirmed the psychometric properties of the SII and structural equation modeling analysis supported the TSI model revealing that nine antecedents represented four higher order facets of involvement: Attraction, self-expression, centrality to lifestyle, and risk. Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) followed by post hoc comparisons revealed significant differences in prior attendance behavior could be traced to individual's involvement profile score. The results have important implications for applying the TSI model to enhance managers' understanding of sport consumers.

Then the model is examined through an empirical study in the Chinese automobile spare parts industry involving 288 respondents and using structural equation modeling. Findings: The results indicate that purchase intention is directly influenced by purchase attitude followed by perceived behavioral control and indirectly influenced by perceived risk, perceived benefit and product knowledge via attitude. Therefore, effective measures to promote consumers' purchase intention rely on coordinated policies built on multiple pillars instead of single factors.

Findings: Five major research areas were identified: research that better links omni-channel and IMC theory and practice; conceptual and empirical research that helps operationalize the consumer-brand engagement construct, including its antecedents and consequences; Build understanding of off- and on-line consumer-brand touchpoints and how they may enhance engagement and profitability; how omni-channel IMC best monetizes buyer–seller relationships; and omni-channel IMC in other consumer decision contexts. Practical implications: The emergence of omni-channel marketing is breaking down the silos across available consumer-brand touchpoints. The intersection of effective omni-channel marketing and IMC strategic and tactical initiatives offers marketers an opportunity to engage their customers and to form profitable relationships. Originality/value: The authors proposed an omni-channel IMC Framework and a research agenda for advancing the field. As this is a new area of inquiry, the authors argue for the development of other comprehensive frameworks, both for general omni-channel IMC conceptualizations. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Brand management; Integrated marketing communications; Multi-channel measurement; Online consumer behavior; Social media marketing; Web 2.0","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85022184073"

Patient satisfaction correlated strongly with ratings for physician courtesy and information-giving, Nonverbal behaviors such as eye contact, bodily positioning, and physical contact did not correlate with patient satisfaction. The correlations between physician behavior and patient satisfaction did not hold for the four women physicians studied. The behavior of 15 internal medicine residents at the University of New Mexico Hospital, each with 10 patients, was observed through a 1-way mirror and the 150 patients rated their satisfaction with their physician. The mean ratings of patient satisfaction were between 6 and 7 on a 7-point scale. Satisfaction ratings did not vary significantly between male or female patients or between Hispanics and Anglos, although patients under 40 years of age tended to provide lower ratings than those over this age. Patient satisfaction correlated highly with physician courtesy (formal greeting and formal closure of the interview) and with information giving. Listening behavior also correlated with patient satisfaction. Physician empathy correlated only weakly with patient satisfaction, while physical attention (eye contact and body positioning) did not correlate at all with this factor. Additional factors that were not significant determinants of patient satisfaction in this study included the physical appearance of the physician, the total time of physician-patient interaction, and the amount of physical contact between patient and physician. There were no significant differences between male and female physicians in the mean ratings of caring behaviors or satisfaction. The satisfaction scores of male patients with female physicians were the same as patients of either sex with male physicians; however, female patients expressed greater satisfaction with their female physicians than did male patients with female physicians or female patients with male physicians.

The lack of a good metric to assess consumers' predisposition to resist innovations has prevented the establishment of a common ground for empirical research and thus hampered progress to date. This paper develops and empirically validates a scale to measure individual differences in consumers' predisposition to resist innovations (hereafter, passive innovation resistance, or PIR). The proposed instrument entails a personality-specific and situation-specific measure that assesses individual differences in consumers' predisposition to resist innovations, emerging from their inclination to resist changes and exhibit status quo satisfaction. The scale represents a measure of the generic tendency to resist innovations and thus captures the notion of a general disposition to act in a consistent way in various situations. The results of multiple studies show that the PIR scale has good psychometric properties, and its relationships with other constructs conform to theoretical expectations. Furthermore, the PIR scale explains and predicts adoption-related behaviors beyond the variance accounted for by traditionally investigated constructs such as innate innovativeness, big-five personality dimensions, or demographic variables. These results clearly reveal the importance of PIR for determining adoption-related behavior but contest a conceptualization of constructs that tap only novelty seeking at a high level as the direct antecedent of adoption. Research that attempts to explain and predict adoption-related behavior can benefit from taking a resistance perspective as well. © 2014 Product Development & Management Association.","","Management; Common ground; Demographic variables; Empirical research; Individual Differences; Innovativeness; Novelty seeking; Personality dimensions; Psychometric properties","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84943200236"

It also aims to address the effect of the impact of product category on consumers' willingness to pay premium prices. Design/approach/methodology: Willingness to pay was studied for seven different product categories (n = 49). Findings: Perceived functional risk is an important determinant of the price that consumers are willing to pay for products that have recycled or reused content. It was also found that consumers will switch from a recycled product to a new product within a smaller range of price for products with high functional risk. Research limitations/implications: The study is exploratory, while it serves its purpose by raising initial questions and finding that this is a complex area that is worth studying. Additional work is clearly required to consider the wide range of potentially relevant variables and a sampling plan that ensures an understanding of the generalisability of findings across the population within a region and across regions. Practical implications: A technique for understanding consumer willingness-to-pay (WTP) is provided and insights into differences are offered between products in terms of WTP for greener products. Practitioners can use this technique to determine the price range and indirectly the profitability of a version of their product based on recycled or reused content. Originality/value: An understanding of WTP for products with recycled or reused content is developed.

Although the effects of price bundling on purchase behavior have been well researched, the effects of price bundling on postpurchase consumption behavior have received almost no attention. In this article, the authors build on the sunk cost literature (e.g., Thaler 1980, 1985) and predict that price bundling leads to a disassociation or ""decoupling"" of transaction costs and benefits, thereby reducing attention to sunk costs and decreasing a consumer's likelihood of consuming a paid-for service (e.g., a theater performance). Four studies show this to be the case. In two lab studies, the authors show that having a bundled four-day ski pass as opposed to four one-day ski tickets decreases a person's likelihood of skiing on the final day of a four-day ski vacation. They replicate this result in a field study, showing that multiperformance ticket holders are more likely to forgo a given theatrical performance than are single-performance ticket holders, all else held constant. In a final study, the authors show that the decreased attention to sunk costs brought about by price bundling can be either cognitively driven (i.e., it is difficult to allocate a single payment across multiple benefits) or motivationally driven (i.e., there is an underlying desire to avoid consumption). Their findings have practical implications for managers interested in predicting or influencing actual product consumption.","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-0035530172"

The results show the explanatory power of repeat visitation, knowledge, and quality of a place as a motivation for tourist expenditure. In accordance with their better knowledge, repeaters spend less than first-timers.

Subjective variables are found to have significant impacts on household carbon emissions. Feeling secure, compliance with rules, and happiness have negative and significant effects on household carbon emissions, whereas the impact of interest in social issues is positive, which indicates the existence of a gap between awareness and behavior. The impacts of consumer lifestyles on the relationship between awareness and household emissions are also explored and are found to play a significant role in the relationship between awareness and emissions. People with a frugal lifestyle not only associate with lower emissions but also reinforce the role of social awareness. Furthermore, substantial differences are found across rural/urban areas and regional and income groups in China. The government should further promote a green lifestyle and give households more incentives to engage in green consumption behavior. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon emissions; China; Consumer lifestyle; Household survey; Social awareness","China; carbon emission; compliance; consumption behavior; domestic waste; household income; household survey; lifestyle; public attitude; state role","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85062279587"

The three evaluative judgement measures were service encounter satisfaction, perceived core service quality and value for money while relational measures comprised social comfort, social regard and friendship. It was found that while personal friendship between customer and service employee was significantly associated with loyalty, service encounter satisfaction was the major predictor.

The hedonic value of eating-out had positive correlation with mood, quick service, cleanliness, food taste, employee kindness, and facilities, the utilitarian value centered on reasonable price, quick service, and promotional incentives. Also, the hedonic value more influenced buying frequency than the utilitarian. This study presents empirical evidence showing that Korean consumers choose fast food restaurants more by hedonic, not utilitarian, values of eating-out. Consequently, fast food restaurant marketers in Korea should consider hedonic aspects as the most important factors in attracting customers.

A conceptual overview of power consisting of three dominant theoretical models is developed onto which is mapped existing consumer empowerment research. Design/methodology/approach - A synthetic review focuses on three perspectives of consumer power: consumer sovereignty, cultural power and discursive power, drawing from sociological, philosophical and economic literature. These models are then applied to consumer research to illuminate research applications and insights. Findings - Research of consumer empowerment has grown significantly over the last decade. Yet, researchers drawing from a variety of intellectual and methodological traditions have generated a multitude of heuristic simplifications and mid-level theories of power to inform their empirical and conceptual explorations. This review helps clarify consumer empowerment, and offers a useful map for future research. Research limitations/implications - Researchers in consumer empowerment need to understand the historical development of power, and to contextualize research within conflicting perspectives on empowerment. Originality/value - The paper makes several contributions: organizes a currently cluttered field of consumer empowerment research, connects consumer and marketing research to high-level theorizations of power, and outlines specific avenues for future research. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Consumer behaviour; Marketing theory; Modelling; Purchasing power","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-33748986216"

Using US data on Internet use within the US population, multiple regression analysis was performed to explore the relationships between chronic medical conditions and frequency of Internet use, as well as changes in health behavior due to frequency of Internet use. The findings suggest that it is not merely the presence of a particular chronic illness, but rather the total number of chronic conditions that determine Internet use.

Therefore, there is a lack of consistency in measuring the construct, particularly with regard to the use of single-item versus multi-item measures. The current research, thus, aims to investigate how processing fluency can be consistently measured across different experimental fluency manipulations and which type of measure has the highest validity. Based on classic scale development procedures, we propose a reliable and valid multi-item measure and compare this measure against a single-item measure in terms of predictive validity. We show that both measures mediate the effect of five established fluency manipulations and that the single-item measure is sufficient. In addition to providing a measure for future research that can be adapted to different empirical settings, we provide empirical evidence on the replicability of fluency effects and on the theoretical conjecture that people have a uniform fluency experience across different manipulations of fluency. © 2017 The Authors.

Existing investigations stem from an overemphasis on profiling consumers who are willing vs. unwilling to pay price premiums for green products using dispositional (socio-demographic and psychological) characteristics. However, little is known about what firm-initiated actions can be taken when consumers do not possess characteristics that favorably influence green purchase behaviors. This research demonstrates that customer participation improves consumers’ willingness to pay more even when consumers exhibit low sustainability-oriented motivation (environmental concern) and ability (eco-literacy). The findings are important for practitioners seeking practical ways to alleviate green purchase barriers. © 2018","Customer participation; Green products; Willingness to pay more","consumption behavior; green economy; participatory approach; price dynamics; sustainability; willingness to pay","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85053835868"

This quasi-experimental study examines the relationship between the perceived environmental performance of a company (PEP) and consumers' purchase intentions, and then determines whether this relationship is moderated by the degree of consumers' environmental involvement (EI) and by the relative price of company products. Surveys were posted to a random sample of residents in Hobart, the capital of Tasmania, Australia. Responses (n. =. 698) show that participants report higher purchase intention for products from high versus low PEP companies, and that participants' EI and product price moderate this relationship. Those with high EI report greater purchase intention for high PEP companies and the reverse for low PEP companies, indicating that participants with high EI are more positively influenced by their perceptions of a company's environmental performance. However, participants are more likely to favor a high PEP company when the relative price of a product is low versus high, irrespective of their level of EI. The strong relationship between companies' PEP and consumers' purchase intentions affirms that developing and managing an environmental brand image may deliver significant benefits, as long as it is appropriately communicated to consumers, and as long as consumers see the added value of making such purchases. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","Consumer attitudes; Consumer behavior; Corporate social responsibility; Green marketing; Pricing","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84878625505"

Two different consumers’ purchase intentions were analysed: consumers were asked both if they would be willing to buy WTV food and if they would buy WTV food if this would help to reduce the environmental impact of agricultural production. Binary logistic regressions are estimated to appraise the eventual drivers of consumers’ statements. Among these drivers, attention was given to aspects related to the generalised aversion to new foods, i.e. food neophobia (FN) and the aversion to food processed in new ways, i.e. food technology neophobia (FTN). Other relevant economic and demographic factors were investigated, together with aspects related to generalised trust, purchase behaviours and preferences. The main results indicate that 56% of respondents declared to be willing to buy WTV food, however, FN and FTN negatively influence the probability of stating a positive purchase intention. Consumers who give importance to reading food labels and think that food could have environmental or health benefits, are more likely to be willing to buy WTV food. In addition, a core of sustainable consumers seems to emerge who express a positive purchase intention for WTV food to reduce the environmental impact of production and give importance to the origin and nutritional values of products. In conclusion, policy implications are drawn. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Circular economy; Food by-product; Food neophobia; Food technology neophobia; Food waste; Sustainable consumption","Agriculture; Food technology; Labels; Population statistics; Public policy; Purchasing; Sales; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Agricultural productions; Binary logistic regression; Circular economy; Food by-products; Food waste; Psychological features; Sustainable consumption; Web-based questionnaires; Environmental impact","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077077099"

The complexity of the choice environment, the ability of the individual to make complex decisions, and the effect of choice context on the decision strategy are generally not considered in statistical model development. One of the reasons for this omission is that theoretical literature on choice complexity and imperfect ability to choose that has developed in psychology and behavioral decision theory (BDT) literatures has not been translated into empirical econometric analysis. Second, the data used in economics and consumer research studies tend to be somewhat different from the data structures used in psychology and BDT literatures. In this paper we outline a theoretical model that simultaneously considers task complexity, effort applied by the consumer, ability to choose, and choice. We then construct a measure of task complexity and incorporate this in an analysis of a number of data series based on the random utility framework. We also examine the performance of our measure of task complexity in a composite data set that allows for increased variability in factors affecting decision context. Our approach provides a mechanism to link research in BDT and econometric modeling of consumer choice. Our findings suggest that task complexity does affect inferences about choice model parameters and that context effects, such as complexity, have a systematic impact on the parameters of econometric models of choice. The modeling approach provides a mechanism for inclusion of results from psychology and BDT in traditional economic models of consumer choice. © 2001 Academic Press.","Choice modeling; Context effects; Random utility theory","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-0035207597"

Building upon the Stimulus-Organism-Response (S-O-R) framework, the current study constructed an integrated model to demonstrate perceived destination eco-friendly reputation as a stimulus; consumption emotions (positive and negative) as organism; tourism satisfaction, recollection, tourist environmentally responsible behavior (ERB) as response. Notably, tourists' recollection is seen within this S-O-R framework as the formation mechanism for prescribed action and consequently as an example of script theory and the generation of consumer responses, thus connecting elements of behavioral and cognitive psychology in a unified framework. Survey data from 522 Chinese tourists were used to empirically examine the integrated tourist ERB model. The findings suggest that destination eco-friendly reputation positively impacts both positive emotions and tourist satisfaction, and eco-friendly reputation negatively impacts negative emotions. Positive emotions significantly and positively influence tourist satisfaction, tourists' recollection, and ERB. Conversely, negative emotions have a significant negative effect on these constructs. Moreover, tourist satisfaction positively influences recollection and ERB, and recollection in turn positively affects ERB.

The moderating influence of buying involvement and environment concerns on all the studied relationships was also examined. Data were collected using structured questionnaire survey at different organic farmers' markets. A total of 282 community-centric organic buyers and 170 non-buyers participated in the study. Structural equation modelling approach was employed for data analysis. The results indicated the significant association of social, emotional, and epistemic values with ethical consumption intentions. Epistemic value was identified as the most important influencer towards both ethical consumption and choice behavior. Buyers and non-buyers were not significantly different. However, consumers with varying levels of environmental concerns were statistically different when it came to the associations of epistemic and price-related functional values and ethical consumption intentions. The study results could be utilized by managers and practitioners to target this niche market and promote organic food among the mainstream market. This may, in turn, lead to increased adoption of the cleaner production practices in terms of organic farming, which is beneficial for both people and the planet. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","And theory of consumption values; Buyer and non-buyer; Environmental concerns; Ethical consumption; Organic food","Agriculture; Commerce; Philosophical aspects; Pollution control; Surveys; Buyer and non-buyer; Consumption values; Environmental concerns; Ethical consumption; Organic foods; Sales","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85069687892"

Following the Uses and Gratifications approach and the Consumers’ Online Brand-Related Activities framework, seven motivations (Information, Entertainment, Personal Identity, Integration and Social Interaction, Empowerment, Remuneration and Brand Love) and three dimensions of online engagement behaviours (Consumption, Contribution and Creation) were considered. A web-based survey was conducted among football club fans of a major UEFA league on Facebook, resulting in 562 responses. The need for Information, Empowerment and Brand Love mainly drive Consumption, Contribution and Creation, respectively, while the need for Integration and Social Interaction emerged as the second most important motivation overall.

Since organic products are credence goods, consumers cannot directly verify whether these products comply with official standards. Organic labels are the primary source of consumer trust in organics, but these labels must be noticed and understood before consumers will actively seek them out. In that some consumers may not prioritize product labels when they shop, it is sometimes up to retailers to strengthen consumer trust. Within the antecedents of this trust, we isolated the contribution of the corporate social responsibility associations held by consumers about retailers. We surveyed Italian customers interested in organics and found that they are more likely to trust the private-label organic products sold by a retailer when it is considered socially responsible. Our results also show that consumer trust translates into brand loyalty and a willingness to pay a premium price for organic products. © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.","Consumer trust; Corporate social responsibility; Ethical labels; Italy; Organic products; Retail industry","Italy; commodity price; consumption behavior; public goods; retailing; standard (regulation); willingness to pay","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-78649498025"

Research tells us a great deal about how the ‘environmental friendliness’ of a package may influence a consumer purchasing decision, but we have little scientific insight into the attributes that shape consumer perceptions of ’environmental friendliness. Hence, we examined how the interplay of environmentally friendly packaging attributes influences an overall evaluation of environmental friendliness, surveying attitudes from three Western consumer cultures: Germany, France, and the U.S. We found that consumers focus predominantly on end-of-life attributes of packaging, although the cultures differ in how they weigh the relative value of recyclability, reusability and biodegradability. We found that consumers concern themselves less with renewable origins, and almost not at all with activities relating to production, transport and retail use. We also found that widespread misunderstanding of biomethane continues to exist; further, the fact that biomethane is ‘biobased’ counts little in consumer ratings if the product is not also ‘biodegradable’. Ethical concerns about the use of agricultural land to produce biogas substrates are raised primarily by German consumers. A comparison with results from LCA studies of packaging revealed a number of discrepancies between consumer perception and facts on the environmental impact of different packaging options. Brand owners advancing environmentally friendly packaging initiatives are advised to feature those eco-advantages that pertain to the post-use phase and to differentiate packaging strategies across countries. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Biomethane; Consumer; Environmentally friendly; Green; Marketing; Packaging; Sustainable","Biodegradability; Consumer behavior; Marketing; Packaging; Purchasing; Reusability; Sustainable development; Biomethane; Consumer; Environmentally friendly; Green; Sustainable; Environmental impact","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85047410140"

However, an integrated literature review of research examining the impact of consumer perceptions of green initiatives on their behavioral intentions is lacking. To that end, a quantitative meta-analysis of 26 articles published in hospitality journals was conducted in order to determine the effect sizes of the relationship between consumers' perceptions and their green behaviors. This research intended to examine how two broad categories - internalized perceptions (i.e. personal values, attitudes, environmental knowledge/awareness, and perceived benefits) and perceptions of the firm (i.e. hotel/restaurant image, perceived quality, and satisfaction) - influence consumers' behavioral intentions toward green hotels/restaurants (e.g., word-of-mouth intentions, retentions, willingness to pay, and willingness to pay a premium). This meta-analysis shows that both internalized perceptions and perceptions of the firm had a strong positive association with behavioral intentions. The average effect sizes for internalized perceptions and perceptions of the firms were r = 0.3177 and r = 0.4240, respectively. The findings of this research suggest that the positive relationship between consumer perceptions and behavioral intentions is well-established. Therefore, it might not be fruitful to continue to apply identical frameworks (e.g., the theory of planned behavior or the theory of reasoned action) in future research. We thus suggest that hospitality and tourism researchers in the area of environment-friendly initiatives need to either significantly improve the existing models or look for new and more diverse frameworks in order to make meaningful theoretical contributions. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Consumer behavioral intentions; Corporate social responsibility (CSR); Environment-friendly; Green hotels and restaurants; Meta-analysis","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84960472852"

However, scarce evidence exists on how the cultural values influence our pro-environmental behavior. To address this gap, we conceptualize a model of cultural influences on pro-environmental consumer behavior. We extend the framework of the Theory of Planned Behavior by including additional variables (environmental values and environmental concern) shown to influence pro-environmental attitudes, intentions, and behaviors. We add to the sustainability literature by identifying central pro-environmental cultural value orientations: collectivism, femininity, future orientation, and uncertainty avoidance, and integrating them into the underlying model of planned behavior as moderating variables. Our theoretical contribution lies in conceptually identifying the cultural values that have a moderating effect on pro-environmental consumer behavior. We show how cultural values can influence the relationship between environmental concern and pro-environmental behavior, and thus mitigate the ‘green gap,’ and the gap between behavioral intentions and behaviors. Our conceptualization is a stepping-stone in recognizing and capitalizing on cross-cultural differences to promote pro-environmental behaviors across cultures. The principal goal of social agents promoting sustainability is formulating communication strategies that appeal to consumer values. In terms of practical implications, this research helps marketers effectively target culturally different consumer segments, which requires an understanding of the cultural and social influences of pro-environmental behaviors. Understanding the moderating role of cultural values also helps in promoting values related to pro-environmental attitudes in other countries. © 2020","Collectivism; Environmental concern; Environmental values; Femininity; Future orientation; Pro-environmental behavior; Uncertainty avoidance","Sustainable development; Communication strategy; Corporate social performance; Cross-cultural differences; Environmental attitudes; Environmental concerns; Pro-environmental behaviors; Theory of Planned Behavior; Uncertainty avoidance; Consumer behavior","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85087476570"

The information cost structure is conceptualized as a trade-off of initial setup costs and ongoing usage costs. Lock-in is defined as consumers' decreased propensity to search and switch after an initial investment, which is determined both by a preference to minimize immediate costs and by an inability to anticipate the impact of future switching costs. The results of three experiments support the proposed mechanism. Experiment 1 shows that a small initial investment is sufficient to produce lock-in. Experiment 2 shows that the results of a prior investment on lock-in are not due to psychological commitment but to a shift in relative costs of incumbent and new options. Experiment 3 shows that respondents fail to anticipate how their prior investment will lock them in.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0043131414"

Design/methodology/approach – The paper examines how social factors and culture shape intentions to purchase a hybrid car using survey data from 1,083 US drivers and 783 Korean drivers. Findings – The paper shows that self-image congruence and propensity to seek information about green products have strong positive relationships with intentions to purchase a hybrid car among consumers from both countries. Perceived social value associated with the consumption of hybrid cars also has a strong positive relationship with intentions to purchase a hybrid car among Korean and, contrary to expectations, US consumers. In contrast, social value associated with green products, in general, has a negative relationship with US consumer hybrid purchase intentions. Research limitations/implications – The use of a web-based survey of drivers regarding hybrid cars may limit the generalizability of the results to other products and countries. Therefore, it is necessary to replicate the results. Practical implications – In light of the results, marketers of hybrid cars in Korea and the USA should consider communicating about the social value of hybrid vehicle adoption and the positive reflection of ownership on the consumer's self-image, focusing on consumers who actively seek information about green products. However, marketers of hybrid cars in the USA limit references to the social value of green products, in general, which may be a turn-off. Originality/value – This paper increases knowledge about the impact of social and cultural factors on decision making regarding hybrid cars. © 2010, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Consumer behaviour; Decision making; Green marketing; Social values; South Korea; United States of America","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-77952189778"

However, two self-selection biases, acquisition bias (mostly consumers with a favorable predisposition acquire a product and hence write a product review) and underreporting bias (consumers with extreme, either positive or negative, ratings are more likely to write reviews than consumers with moderate product ratings), render the mean rating a biased estimator of product quality, and they result in the well-known J-shaped (positively skewed, asymmetric, bimodal) distribution of online product reviews. To better understand the nature and consequences of these two self-selection biases, we analytically model and empirically investigate how these two biases originate from consumers' purchasing and reviewing decisions, how these decisions shape the distribution of online product reviews over time, and how they affect the firm's product pricing strategy. Our empirical results reveal that consumers do realize both self-selection biases and attempt to correct for them by using other distributional parameters of online reviews, besides the mean rating. However, consumers cannot fully account for these two self-selection biases because of bounded rationality. We also find that firms can strategically respond to these self-selection biases by adjusting their prices. Still, since consumers cannot fully correct for these two self-selection biases, product demand, the firm's profit, and consumer surplus may all suffer from the two self-selection biases. This paper has implications for consumers to leverage online product reviews to infer true product quality, for commercial websites to improve the design of their online product review systems, and for product manufacturers to predict the success of their products.","Analytical modeling; Consumer behavior; Econometric models; Electronic commerce; Online product reviews; Product quality; Product uncertainty; Product value; Sales forecasting; Self-selection biases","Analytical models; Consumer behavior; Customer satisfaction; Electronic commerce; Online systems; Quality control; Rating; Sales; Uncertainty analysis; Econometric model; Online product reviews; Product uncertainties; Product value; Sales forecasting; Self-selection bias; Product design","Review","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85019864394"

The first suite of articles views the environmental impacts associated with household consumption from the perspectives of different consumer groups, income levels, and geographic areas. This work confirms and refines several insights that have been developing over the past several years, namely that food and beverages, mobility, housing, and energy-using products are the most critical consumption domains from the standpoint of environmental sustainability and that higher household income leads to greater (but less than proportional) impacts. The second subset of articles analyzes the potential for mitigating these impacts through behavioral changes and innovation strategies. Although the contributions to this special issue describe several noteworthy examples of information- and team-based initiatives to catalyze behavioral changes, the state of knowledge pertaining to this aspect of the consumption problem is much more inchoate.

Pre-processed official statistical data of overnight stays and tourist arrivals from all the different countries of origin to Catalonia from 2001 to 2009 is used in the study. When comparing the forecasting accuracy of the different techniques for different time horizons, autoregressive integrated moving average models outperform self-exciting threshold autoregressions and artificial neural network models, especially for shorter horizons. These results suggest that the there is a trade-off between the degree of pre-processing and the accuracy of the forecasts obtained with neural networks, which are more suitable in the presence of nonlinearity in the data. In spite of the significant differences between countries, which can be explained by different patterns of consumer behaviour, we also find that forecasts of tourist arrivals are more accurate than forecasts of overnight stays. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Catalonia; Forecasting; Neural networks; Time series models; Tourism demand","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84886070510"

The problem with using different subjects for each service is that the subject's demographic characteristics may be responsible for the significant differences in expectations of quality. This research uses a controlled, repeated measures design where subjects were each asked to evaluate three services, varying in their degree of intangibility, over a ten week period. This made it possible to look at service quality expectations without risking the problem that demographics would account for most of the differences in the data.

The symbolic exchange value of the gift is especially amenable to investigation via ethnographic methods and projective techniques. In this paper, negativity and ambivalence in gift exchange, a theme derived from a comparative ethnographic study of two midwestern American gift stores, are refined and elaborated through projective analysis. What emerges is a more balanced and comprehensive account of gift giving than presently available in the literature of consumer-object relations. Gift giving and receiving engender high levels of anxiety among consumers. Gifts create and exacerbate interpersonal conflict. They are frequently used as weapons, and consumers' responses to them are carefully canalized. The ways in which negativity is managed by donors and recipients are examined. Consumers, victims of sentiment and symbolism, are found to be entrapped in rituals and enjoined by cultural ideology from expressing discontent in most ways except fantasy. The impact of such fantasy on gift giving, and its relevance for marketers, is explored in this article. © 1993.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-38248998709"

Since unobservable (to the researcher) product attributes, such as coupon availability, may impact consumer utility as well as price setting by firms, we treat prices as endogenous. Specifically, prices are assumed to be the equilibrium outcomes of Nash competition among manufacturers and retailers. To empirically validate the assumptions, we estimate logit demand systems jointly with equilibrium pricing equations for two product categories using retail scanner data and cost data on factor prices. In each category, we find statistical evidence of price endogeneity. We also find that the estimates of the price response parameter and the brand-specific constants are generally biased downward when the endogeneity of prices is ignored. Our framework provides explicit estimates of the value created by a brand, i.e., the difference between consumers' willingness to pay for a brand and its cost of production. We develop theoretical propositions about the relationship between value creation and competitive advantage for logit demand systems and use our empirical results to illustrate how firms use alternative value creation strategies to accomplish competitive advantage.","Competitive Strategy; Demand Estimation; Endogeneity; Logit","Competition; Costs; Strategic planning; Equilibrium framework; Logic demand estimation; Marketing","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0032207336"

Policy makers often attempt to promote healthy eating behaviors by raising consumers' health consciousness. Given that previous health campaigns have fallen short of expectations, this article examines the potential of health consciousness to resolve the so-called unhealthy = tasty intuition (UTI). Study 1 explores whether health consciousness attenuates belief in the UTI and its detrimental consequences for food choice and body mass. Study 2 applies the Implicit Association Test to disentangle the UTI's implicit and explicit processes. The results show that health consciousness operates only through cognitively controlled processes. Using real food products, Study 3 analyzes how health consciousness colors the influence of composition and labeling on tastiness and healthiness perceptions. The studies jointly demonstrate that the UTI partly works implicitly and independently of health consciousness. Thus, the obesity epidemic should be addressed through concerted actions that include policy makers' health communications and the food industry's product development. © 2015, American Marketing Association.","Health consciousness; Implicit association test; Labeling; Sensory perception; Unhealthy = tasty intuition","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84931864553"

Besides targeting the insulation standard, innovative (i.e. renewable energies-based and/or energy-efficient) residential heating systems (RHS) offer the potential to reduce CO 2 emissions from space heating. Therefore, understanding the determinants of the RHS adoption decision becomes increasingly important. In this paper, we analyze the influence of preferences about RHS-specific attributes on the homeowners' adoption decision. Moreover, we control for the influence of socio-demographic, home and spatial characteristics. To this end, we specify the discrete appliance choice by a multinomial logit model and apply it to representative survey data for Germany. Our findings show that there are different drivers for the adoption of innovative RHS (partly) based on renewable energies in newly built and existing 1- and 2-family homes, and that the importance of key drivers also differs across groups of homeowners and RHS, respectively. First, we find that adopters of a gas- and oil-fired condensing boiler with solar thermal support have a strong preference for energy savings, while adopters of a heat pump or wood pellet-fired boiler prefer being more independent from fossil fuels. Second, we find that owners of existing homes have less scope for preferences in the RHS adoption decision. The decision to replace a RHS in an existing home is rather driven by socio-demographic, home and spatial characteristics. Third, our findings are quite contrary for newly built homes. Here, preferences about RHS specific attributes are found to be highly relevant, while there is less evidence for an influence of socio-demographic, home and spatial characteristics on the adoption decision. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Consumer behavior; Discrete choice; Residential heating systems; Space heating; Technology adoption","Germany; Carbon dioxide; Consumer behavior; Energy utilization; Fossil fuels; Heating equipment; Lead acid batteries; Population statistics; Space heating; Adoption decision; Condensing boilers; Discrete choice; Discrete choice analysis; Energy efficient; Germany; Heat pumps; Multinomial logit model; Primary energy consumption; Renewable energies; Residential building; Residential heating; Solar thermal; Spatial characteristics; Survey data; Technology adoption; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; discrete choice analysis; energy use; fossil fuel; heating; logit analysis; numerical model; renewable resource; technology adoption; Rhodium compounds","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84862627842"

We then profile the segments along the twin dimensions of demographics and benefits sought. We show that benefits sought can provide more diagnostic information than mere descriptive demographic profiling. Our study has some interesting findings that shed light on consumer perceptions and behavior with respect to online commerce. First, consumers are more concerned about web attributes that are associated with perceived losses than with web attributes that consumers associate with gains. Second, compared to other online purchase-related attributes, getting the lowest price does not appear to be a very important attribute for web shoppers. This finding may also indicate that prices on web pages are somewhat similar, and consumers are moving on to other criteria to continue their evaluation process. Third, demographics do not discriminate between web buyers even though that has been the traditional focus with the Internet. Fourth, there is a large segment of web surfers who dislike buying on the Web; the predominant reason for this appears to be their perception about the security of sensitive information. This segment feels that not only is it the most important of all attributes for online commerce, but also that the Web does a very poor job on this attribute/benefit. © 2002 Elsevier Inc.

Attitudes, motives, and willingness to pay for organic products have been measured, but apparently no retail data have been available to estimate own-price, cross-price, and income elasticities. Although high retail price premiums for organic foods persist, elasticity estimates appear to be critically important for gauging how the U.S. market for organic food might grow in the future. Demographic variables such as age, marital status, number and age of children, and educational attainment might be important variables in explaining and predicting consumer demand for organic products. Estimates of habit persistence linked to age and household composition might also be important for measuring the potential growth of organic foods. Accounting for where foods are purchased is likely to be important in understanding where potential growth in organic foods might occur. The emergence of natural foods supermarkets demonstrates how new types of retail outlets can promote organic products and change consumers' buying habits. Because households buy with varying degrees of frequency at a variety of retail outlets-mainstream and natural foods supermarkets, club stores, health food stores, food co-ops, gourmet stores, and so on-analysts might want to model the effects of store choice and frequency of visits on organic product choices. Scanner data linked with consumer panels might facilitate this avenue of research. With over 40% of retail food expenditures made on food away from home, another potentially important area of investigation will be how household decisions to purchase food away from home can affect the demand for organic products. Nontraditional, perhaps proprietary data sources might be required to estimate the demand for organic foods as a component of the demand for food away from home. If retail data are not readily available, food service purveyors and fresh produce consolidators might be a source of data for indirect measurement of demand for fresh and processed organic foods.","","United States; consumption behavior; food preference; organic farming","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0032311319"

Just-world theory highlights the conditions under which consumers are most likely to prefer fair-trade products. This theory proposes that people are motivated to construe the world as a just place where people get what they deserve. In the current research, when people are confronted with high levels of injustice (communicated need is high) and avenues for justice restoration seem uncertain or unavailable, assisting others by supporting fair trade decreases. However, highlighting how injustice can be redressed through purchases enhances fair-trade support under conditions of high need. The effects are moderated by justice sensitivity factors, such as just-world beliefs and whether the product type (indulgence vs. necessity) makes the injustice of consumer privilege salient. The results suggest that communicating high need when requesting consumer prosocial actions can sometimes backfire. Marketers employing high need appeals should heighten perceptions of justice restoration potential and activate fairness-related thoughts through product positioning to encourage fair-trade purchases. © 2012, American Marketing Association.","Belief in a just world; Ethical products; Fair trade; Justice; Need; Prosocial behavior","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84859592296"

To achieve this aim, customer satisfaction and trust must be measured and ""switching costs"" identified. The latter render subscribers' preference for rival operators more expensive. In this connection, this paper's aim is to measure the effects of customer satisfaction and trust on customer loyalty, and the direct and indirect effect of ""switching cost"" on customer loyalty. Design/methodology/approach - The data set covered 1,662 mobile phone users in Turkey. The data were analyzed by moderated regression analysis to test the hypotheses. Findings - The findings of this study show that the switching cost factor directly affects loyalty, and has a moderator effect on both customer satisfaction and trust. Therefore, it plays a crucial role in winning customer loyalty. In short, it is a quasi moderator. However, switching costs was measured as a unidimensional factor, but switching costs in fact contains psychological, financial and procedural sub-dimensions. Therefore, future research might measure the sub-dimensions of switching costs and examine their moderating effects. Originality/value - With respect to the findings, trust has more importance than customer satisfaction in engendering loyalty, since trust contains belief in the brand, which provides positive outcomes not only in the present but also in the future. But customer satisfaction does not contain this dimension. So, the effect of trust on loyalty becomes greater than the effect of customer satisfaction. Therefore, any GSM operator who wishes to preserve its existing subscriber base should concentrate on winning its subscribers' trust. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Consumer behaviour; Costs; Customer loyalty; Customer satisfaction; Mobile communication systems","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-19944400089"

Although moderate levels of impulse buying can be pleasant and gratifying, recent theoretical work suggests that chronic, high frequency impulse buying has a compulsive element and can function as a form of escape from negative affective states, depression, and low self-esteem. Design/methodology/approach - The present research empirically tests a theoretical model of impulse buying by examining the associations between chronic impulse buying tendencies and subjective wellbeing, affect, susceptibility to interpersonal influence, and self-esteem. Findings - Results indicate that the cognitive facet of impulse buying, associated with a lack of planning in relation to purchase decisions, is negatively associated with subjective wellbeing. The affective facet of impulse buying, associated with feelings of excitement and an overpowering urge to buy, is linked to negative affect and susceptibility to interpersonal influence. Practical implications - Given the link to negative emotions and potentially harmful consequences, impulse buying may be viewed as problematic consumer behavior. Reductions in problematic impulse buying could be addressed through public policy or social marketing. Originality/value - This study validates and extends the Verplanken et al. model by examining the relationship between impulse buying and other psychological constructs (i.e. subjective wellbeing, positive and negative affect, social influence, and self-esteem). © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Buying behaviour; Cognition; Self esteem","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-38349131623"

The emerging integrated environment would engage more consumers if compared to the single handled channel, which in turn would avoid switching behaviours towards competitors' channels. Our empirical research, based on the stimulus-organism-response paradigm, involves a sample of 237 consumers who were asked to explore the new retail settings simulated in a university lab. The results lead us to suggest the effective combination of multiple channels managed by one retailer as the new challenge for scholars and practitioners.

S-commerce is a combination a commercial and social activities in which individuals may spread word of mouth (WOM) about their shopping experiences and knowledge and provide information about product and services to their to their friends. This kind of social interactions among individuals has increased the potentials of eWOM communication. Given such a backdrop, this paper aims to look into the influence of eWOM engagement on consumers’ purchase intention in s-commerce, which may complement the current effort of the research community in this area. Design/methodology/approach: This study used elaboration likelihood model, theory of reasoned action and social support theory to investigate the influence of eWOM engagement on consumers’ purchase intention in s-commerce. The study used 218 respondents to evaluate the proposed model using SmartPLS. Findings: The empirical results indicate that information characteristics, consumer behavior and technological factors exert a positive influence on consumer purchase intentions. All hypotheses between attitude toward eWOM, information credibility, innovativeness, website quality and eWOM engagement are significant. Also, eWOM engagement has a significant positive influence on consumer purchase intention. However, information quality and social support does not have any significant relationship with eWOM engagement. Research limitations/implications: This study seeks to address the dearth of research in the field of s-commerce, especially as it relates to eWOM. The study proposes a new model and empirically validates the hypothesized relationships. This research can serve as a stepping stone for future research in this field. Practical implications: This study is one of the early studies focusing on the influence of eWOM engagement, especially in s-commerce. The study offers comprehensive and empirically validated factors pertaining to eWOM engagement in s-commerce. The results of this study are also important to practitioners and online companies’ managers. The study’s model has demonstrated the contextualization of what makes customers engage in eWOM and its influence in s-commerce. The study will also offer insights for firms on how to encourage eWOM engagement among customers. Originality/value: A new eWOM engagement model in s-commerce is proposed with consideration on information characteristics, consumer behavior, technological and social factors. The model is validated afterwards. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","E-commerce; Electronic word of mouth; Engagement; eWOM; Social marketing; Social networking","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85047876125"

Data was obtained from a nationwide panel (n=1760) and included survey data and retail scanner data for seven different product categories in the sector of goods for daily needs. Results show that consumers care for the environment and mirror environmental attitudes in their purchasing behavior (self-reported). Especially norms and willingness to pay are strong predictors of SRB. However, SRB is not transferred to actual purchasing behavior. Therefore, the findings corroborate the gap between stated and actual behavior. Implications for marketing are derived to encourage consumers to purchase environmentally friendly products.

We argue that people with a fixed mindset are more likely to seek products and brands in line with their goals to burnish their self-image and demonstrate their positive qualities, while people with a growth mindset seek products that help them pursue their goals to improve and learn new things. Thus, products and brands may serve important self-enhancement functions-encouraging consumers to reinforce or expand core aspects of their identity. We also suggest that brands and companies can project a fixed or growth mindset. In turn, these organizational mindsets should shape consumers' expectations of, and relationships with, products, brands, and companies. © 2015 Society for Consumer Psychology.","Consumer behavior; Fixed and growth mindset; Implicit theories; Lay theories","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84952864991"

We use data from two large-scale field experiments and two lab experiments to show that, although personalization can substantially enhance banner effectiveness, its impact hinges on its interplay with timing and placement factors. First, personalization increases click-through especially at an early information state of the purchase decision process. Here, banners with a high degree of content personalization (DCP) are most effective when a consumer has just visited the advertiser’s online store, but quickly lose effectiveness as time passes since that last visit. We call this phenomenon overpersonalization. Medium DCP banners, on the other hand, are initially less effective, but more persistent, so that they outperform high DCP banners over time. Second, personalization increases click-through irrespective of whether banners appear on motive congruent or incongruent display websites. In terms of view-through, however, personalization increases ad effectiveness only on motive congruent websites, but decreases it on incongruent websites. We demonstrate in the lab how perceptions of ad informativeness and intrusiveness drive these results depending on consumers’ experiential or goal-directed Web browsing modes. © 2015 INFORMS.","Advertising effectiveness; Online advertising; Personalization; Retargeting","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84939593412"

Design-methodology-approach The impact of innovativeness, compatibility, affinity, TAM beliefs (ease of use and usefulness) and attitude on mobile shopping adoption is tested through structural equation modelling techniques. The sample consisted of 470 Spanish mobile telephone users selected on the basis of convenience. Findings Data analysis shows that the effect of perceived usefulness and, in a minor degree, perceived ease of use are over dimensioned if personality variables are omitted making intention formation to be perceived as more rational than it really is. Personality variables (affinity to mobile telephones, compatibility and innovativeness) have a direct and positive influence on the intention to engage in M-shopping. Practical implications This research enables mobile shopping agents to know what aspects to highlight in their communication strategies to increase the M-services adoption rate. The complementary use of the mobile and the internet is recommended since the similarities between both methods may favour the acceptance of distance shopping systems. Mobile services should not be simply designed as easy to use, but also as an enjoyable experience.

Relatively few articles have addressed policy measures designed to increase the adoption of EVs by incentives to influence car buyers' voluntary behavior. This article examines the effects of such policy measures. Two of these attributes are monetary measures, two others are traffic regulations, and the other three are related to investments in charging infrastructure. Consumer preferences were assessed using a choice-based conjoint analysis on an individual basis by applying the hierarchical Bayes method. In addition, the Kano method was used to elicit consumer satisfaction. This not only enabled the identification of preferences but also why preferences were based on either features that were ""must-haves"" or on attributes that were not expected but were highly attractive and, thus, led to high satisfaction. The results of surveys conducted in 20 countries in 5 continents showed that the installation of a charging network on freeways is an absolute necessity. This was completely independent from the average mileage driven per day. High cash grants were appreciated as attractive; however, combinations of lower grants with charging facilities resulted in similar preference shares in market simulations for each country. The results may serve as initial guidance for policymakers and practitioners in improving their incentive programs for electric mobility. © 2015 The Author.","Electric vehicles; Governmental incentives; Policy measurements","Economics; Electric automobiles; Electric vehicles; Investments; Charging infrastructures; Choice-based conjoint; Consumer preferences; Consumer satisfactions; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Government regulation; Governmental incentives; Zero emission vehicles; electric vehicle; emission control; global perspective; governance approach; incentive; infrastructural development; planning method; planning process; policy approach; transportation planning; transportation policy; Laws and legislation","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84942798471"

The overall aim is to gain some insights into the product style preferences of consumers and what this means in practical terms to wine product marketing. Design/methodology/approach Information was obtained from a random sample of 150 visitors to ten wineries in the Yarra Valley wine region in Australia. Data were collected by means of selfadministration surveys using a highly structured questionnaire at each of the winery tasting room venues. Findings Specific differences exist in the wine consumption behaviour and sensory preferences of males and females and between generational cohorts, specifically Millennial and older consumers. Females drink less wine than males, spend less thereon but tend to “compensate” for this by buying higher priced wine per bottle, which could represent a riskreduction strategy. Females are noticeably higher than their male counterparts in white wine consumption, showing a preference for a sweeter wine style at a young age, and reported a strong preference for medium body style wines over light and fullbodied wines. From a sensory preference viewpoint, fruit tastes and aromas are by far the most important, especially among females, as are vegetative characters, wood/oak, and mouthfeel characters. More males, on the other hand, preferred the aged characters of wine. Research limitations/implications It is possible to target wine consumers in accordance with their gender and lifecycle stage as far as the sensory and certain behavioural aspects of the product are concerned. However, this should not be oversimplified and drive product marketing strategies in the wrong direction. Originality/value This study is of value to academic researchers, wine industry practitioners and other wine distribution channel members alike, as it provides insights into consumer behaviour differences and one of the core tangible aspects of a wine product, namely the sensory preferences of consumers. © 2011, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Age groups; Australia; Consumer behaviour; Consumption; Gender; Wines","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-78751613187"

PLF has started being adopted only recently, but the need of technological support on farm is getting more and more important and is facilitating its distribution on farms. A huge number of researches and scientific studies are available in literature about the adoption of technology, sensors and computer tools for almost all reared species. In this literature review, the goal is to study the recent progresses of PLF, and in particular the scientific studies carried out in the last 7 years (2013–2019) on dairy cattle farming. Health, welfare and production aspects were taken into account together with animal behaviour, environmental barn conditions and their effect on the three pillars of sustainability: environmental, economic and social. From the main findings, it can be underlined that PLF brings environmental, economic and social sustainability benefits on farms, but these benefits have not yet been quantified through specific methods for sustainability assessments. Therefore, it is important for near future researches to focus not only on the technological improvements of tools and sensors but also on the aspects of environmental, economic and social sustainability of livestock productions that impact on both farmers and the community and consumers. The role of PLF is more and more important and will support the process of decision-making of farmers, change their role on farm and their management view, and make possible the traceability of products and the control of the quality of products and of the animals living conditions as required from policy-makers and stakeholders. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Data collection; Efficiency improvement; Farm monitoring; Performance indicators; Sensors; Sustainability","Agriculture; Animals; Behavioral research; Decision making; Sensors; Data collection; Efficiency improvement; Performance indicators; Precision livestock farming; Sustainability assessment; Sustainable production; Technological improvements; Technological supports; Sustainable development","Review","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85082649699"

A secondary objective was to examine whether one's ethnic group membership and ethnic identification serve as important factors that influence personal values as well as attitudes and patronage behavior in the context of regional shopping malls. The sample of regional mall shoppers consisted of white and Hispanic consumers residing in ten metropolitan cities of the southwest. Structural equation modeling indicated that both self-actualizing and social affiliation personal values were positively related to a favorable attitude toward regional shopping malls, and that the social affiliation value played a greater role in influencing attitude than did the self-actualizing value. Individual attitudes toward shopping malls, in turn, were a direct predictor of mall shopping behavior and mediated the relationship between personal values and attitudes. The findings indicate that, independent of ethnic group membership, both self-actualizing and social affiliation values can be used effectively to position regional malls in such a way as to reinforce these views and to provide a strong means for shoppers to satisfy these needs.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0032020074"

In this paper, we study the relationships between consumer perceptions of risk and trust and the attitude towards purchasing at a consumer-to-consumer electronic marketplace (EM). Typical for EM settings is that consumer behaviour is subject to perceptions of the selling party as well as of the institutional structures of the intermediary that is operating the EM. Building upon the well-established literature of trust, we consider the concepts of intermediary trust and seller trust. We extend this categorisation by introducing the concepts of intermediary risk and seller risk. We developed measurement instruments for intermediary risk and seller risk. All measurement scales have acceptable alphas and are unidimensional. An empirical study is conducted to explore the relationships between the risk and trust types and consumer purchase attitude. The results reveal significant, direct effects of seller trust and seller risk. Second-order effects of intermediary trust and intermediary risk are investigated and reported.

However, little is known about the motives that drive some toward, or deter others from, higher levels of ethical concern and action in their purchasing decisions. Following a qualitative investigation using ZMET and focus group discussions, a questionnaire was developed and administered to a representative sample of consumers; nearly 1,000 usable questionnaires were collected. The degree of awareness, concern and action regarding 16 ethical issues was quantified, using a measure developed from the Stages of Change concept within the Transtheoretical model. Motivations for ethical behaviour, in relation to each individual's most salient ethical issue, were investigated using initially 22 motive statements within the framework of the Decisional Balance Scale (DBS). The findings suggest that the DBS and Stages model have an explanatory value within the ethical decision-making context, and that the motives identified do reflect the Decisional Balance Constructs. Indeed the study suggests that respondents' motivational attitudes are a function of their stage of ethical awareness, concern and action. Therefore, the Decisional Balance Scale may well prove useful for designing appropriate interventions and communications to facilitate movement towards more ethical decision-making. These findings yield strategic insight for communicating messages to ethical consumers and for better understanding their purchasing decisions. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Decisional balance scale; Ethical consumers; Ethical motives; Stages models; Transtheoretical model","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-42949137407"

Expert opinion or qualitative market analyses have tended to be the sources of this information. However, greater scrutiny on governments increasingly demands the use of reliable and credible evidence to support policy decisions. While discrete choice research and modeling techniques have been applied to estimate consumer preferences for technologies, these methods often assume static preferences. This study builds on the application of discrete choice research and modeling to capture dynamics in consumer preferences. We estimate Canadians' preferences for new vehicle technologies under different market assumptions, using responses from two national surveys focused on hybrid gas-electric vehicles and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. The results support the relevance of a range of vehicle attributes beyond the purchase price in shaping consumer preferences towards clean vehicle technologies. They also corroborate our hypothesis that the degree of market penetration of clean vehicle technologies is an influence on people's preferences ('the neighbor effect'). Finally, our results provide behavioural parameters for the energy-economy model CIMS, which we use here to show the importance of including consumer preference dynamics when setting policies to encourage the uptake of clean technologies. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Design/methodology/approach: Ordinary Chinese consumers (n=479) were intercepted and filled out a questionnaire outside upscale supermarkets in Guangzhou. Multigroup structural equation modeling was used to test hypotheses about personal values' moderating effect in the theory of planned behavior. Findings: Self-transcendence values moderate the relationship between two antecedents and behavioral intentions: the attitude towards buying organic food and perceived behavioral control. Both of these antecedents have a stronger impact on intentions among consumers with strong self-transcendence values than among consumers with weak ones. Research limitations/implications: The study is based on a single consumer survey collected from a convenience sample of consumers from one Chinese city. Hence, care needs to be exercised when making inferences about causality and representativeness. Practical implications: Study results have direct implications for the marketing of organic food. As the food safety problem in China is getting more severe and environmental issues are increasing on the political and public agendas, the consumption of organic food is being increasingly advocated by both the government and food producers, as a healthy and environment-friendly alternative, which also may contribute positively to the development of the economy.

Building a latrine is the first step on the sanitation ladder in developing countries where a majority of the population defecates in open or public areas. Public health programs to improve sanitation have consistently framed promotional messages in terms of fecal-oral disease prevention and largely fail to motivate changes in sanitation behavior. A qualitative consumer study using in-depth interviews with 40 household heads was carried out to explore the decision to install a pit latrine in rural Benin. The motives for installing a latrine are reported and variations across the interviews are examined. The paper asserts that at least one active drive (desire for change or dissatisfaction) from among 11 found is needed to motivate latrine adoption. Drives involved prestige, well-being, and situational goals. Health considerations played only a minor role, and had little if anything to do with preventing fecal-oral disease transmission. Drives varied with gender, occupation, life stage, travel experience, education, and wealth, and reflected perceptions of the physical and social geography of the village, linked to availability of open defecation sites, social structure, road access, and urban proximity. The results have broad implications for new messages and strategies to promote sanitation in developing countries. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

These three most common conventional retailing layout types were transformed into virtual layouts for computer-mediated interfaces. Subjects in Greece and the UK participated in a laboratory experiment: they were given a planned shopping task with money to spend, and performed their shopping through a virtual store with layout as the manipulated variable. The results show that layout significantly affects online consumer behavior, but that predictions generated from the literature of conventional retailing about differences in the outcome of layouts do not generally hold in a virtual setting.

The conceptual model encompasses four elements (subjective norms, perceived behaviour control, moral norms and attitude) and one consumer response (purchase intention). Design/methodology/approach: The current research employs a questionnaire survey and two experiments. In Study 1, the hypotheses were tested using structural equation modelling with 485 consumers in China. Study 2 employed a single-factor, two-condition (morally engaged vs control), between-subject design. Findings: The findings reveal that the morally extended TPB framework is more applicable in predicting Chinese consumers' green purchase intentions than the original TPB model. Attitude plays the most significant role in predicting purchase intentions, and moral norms prove to be a mediator of the relationship between the original construct of subjective norms and purchase intentions. The findings further revealed that moral norms comprise the underlying mechanism of the relationship between subjective norms and attitude. Originality/value: This study therefore expands the TPB theory by including moral norms. Moreover, it contributes to the literature by clarifying the direct, indirect and total effects of each TPB element on the purchase intentions towards green products.

While in their infancy, several brands are now utilising VAs such as the Amazon Echo to deliver brand-related information and services. However, despite the increasing use of VAs, we have little understanding of what motivates consumers to use such devices for brand-related information. Focusing on the Amazon Echo in-home VA, and its associated Alexa Skills, this research uncovers the key drivers of consumer brand engagement through VAs. In study 1, through a set of in-depth exploratory interviews with 21 respondents, we established three factors as key drivers of why consumers use VAs to engage with brands: AI attributes, technology attributes, and situational attributes. Study 2 examines these specific drivers via a questionnaire with 724 respondents. The findings outline the VA as an actor in the engagement process and affirm the importance of the VA's AI attributes of social presence, perceived intelligence, and social attraction in influencing consumer brand engagement. Additionally, technology attributes influence consumer brand engagement, along with the utilitarian benefits derived from interactions with brand-related information. Hedonic benefits do not influence consumer brand engagement via VA technology, while trust concerns play a negative role in brand engagement behaviour. Lastly, the results convey that consumer brand engagement via a VA influences brand usage intention, but in contrast to previous research, does not directly influence future purchase intention. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Artificial Intelligence (AI); Automated technology; Consumer brand engagement; Voice assistants","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097776557"

Researchers employing a variety of methods have observed these boomerang effects in connection with interventions in a number of different contexts. One possible explanation for such boomerang effects lies in the theory of psychological reactance, roughly defined as the state of being aroused in opposition to perceived threats to personal choice. In particular, some consumer reactions described in research on alcoholic beverage warnings, alcohol education efforts, and the minimum drinking age can be concisely explained in terms of psychological reactance. An obvious implication is that boomerang effects should be taken into account as one of the potential costs of launching a mass communication campaign or requiring a warning. In some cases (such as warnings about the health effects of alcohol abuse) there may be so little to be gained in terms of improved consumer knowledge that the potential cost of oppositional attitudes or behavior should receive substantial attention in the evaluation of proposed and current interventions. © 2002 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","","","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-27944475312"

What are the reasons for the observed reaction behavior? We answer these questions by performing a large-scale empirical study on the short-run and long-run reactions to promotion and advertising shocks in over 400 consumer product categories over a four-year time span. Our results clearly show that the most predominant form of competitive response is passive in nature. When a reaction does occur, it is usually retaliatory in the same instrument, i.e., promotion attacks are countered with promotions, and advertising attacks are countered with advertising. There are very few long-run consequences of any type of reaction behavior. By linking reaction behavior to both cross- and own-effectiveness, we further demonstrate that passive behavior is often a sound strategy, while firms that do opt to retaliate often use ineffective instruments, resulting in ""spoiled arms."" Accommodating behavior is observed in only a minority of cases, and often results in a missed sales opportunity when promotional support is reduced. The ultimate impact of most promotion and advertising campaigns depends primarily on the nature of consumer response, not the vigilance of competitors. © 2005 INFORMS.","Advertising and price-promotion effects; Competitive strategy; Empirical generalizations; Time-series analysis","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-14844309931"

Since L. albigena has among the thickest dental enamel in extant primates and is commonly referred to as a hard-object consumer, we predicted that their diet would be harder than that of the guenon. Data on diet and food hardness (as measured by resistance to puncture and crushing) were collected between June-October of 1997 at Kibale National Park, Uganda, and were compared to similar data collected in Kibale between 1991-1994. Contrary to what we predicted, there was no difference in dietary hardness when the puncture resistance of all fruit consumed by the two species was compared (31 tree species in both study periods). However, in June-October 1997, L. albigena exploited a diet more resistant to puncture and crushing than C. ascanius. This difference is largely explained by the higher percentage of bark and seeds consumed by the L. albigena during this period. We suggest that it is the difference in the mechanical properties of fallback foods during critical periods that may have served as the selective pressure for thick enamel in L. albigena. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Cercopithecus; Feeding behavior; Frugivory; Kibale National Park, Uganda; Lophocebus; Selection","Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; Cercopithecinae; Dental Enamel; Food Analysis; Fruit; Hardness Tests; Plant Bark; Seeds; Species Specificity; Uganda; article; bark; Cercocebus; Cercopithecus; controlled study; diet; eating habit; enamel; feeding behavior; food composition; food intake; food preference; forage; fruit; nonhuman; plant seed","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-8844240748"

Building on past research in impression management theory and the upper-echelons perspective, I argue that firms facing increased visibility among different stakeholder groups will increase corporate reputation management activities towards those groups and decrease activities towards other groups. I further argue that top management group characteristics will moderate these relationships, suggesting that certain top management groups are more attuned to the situational needs of reputation management. A set of hypotheses are tested using pooled cross-sectional time-series data on a set of Fortune 500 companies. Results indicate that firms generally directed reputation management activities towards their more visible stakeholders. However, the type and extent of reputation management behaviour varied. Specifically, for firms whose top management groups were more highly educated or output oriented, highly visible situations with the media were more likely to be associated with a higher use of press releases. Moreover, those same firms devoted more resources to mass media advertising under situations of high consumer visibility compared to firms whose top management groups were less educated or throughput oriented. © Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2006.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-33745299959"

However, are consumers ready for mobile marketing through their smartphones? This study aims to investigate consumers' willingness to accept marketing through their smartphones. Design/methodology/approach: The study is based on an online survey of 428 respondents. The data is analyzed through ANOVA and regression analysis. Findings: The results indicate that consumers' shopping style, brand trust, and value are key motivations for engaging in mobile marketing through their smartphones. Further research should focus on specific tactics marketers use to engage customers beyond marketing messages, that is, how they engage customers in dialogue to build relationships, encourage purchases and build loyalty. This could reveal how customers really want to engage in mobile marketing. Research limitations/implications: This research adds to the growing body of evidence on acceptance of mobile marketing. Practical implications: This study found that successful enagement of customers in mobile marketing requires that marketers focus their strategies and tactics around value creation; getting customers to engage with their brand in an authentic way; and respecting customers' shopping style, i.e. engaging customers the way they want to be engaged. Marketers must listen to their customers and develop appropriate strategies rather than simply adapting existing marketing strategies. Originality/value: The topic of mobile marketing through smartphones is important to both marketing executives and marketing researchers. To date, this topic has attracted little research attention and marketing executives are simply basing their decsions on anecdotal case studies and reports in the popular press. This study contributes to fulfilling the need for research evidence. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Consumer behaviour; Digital marketing; Mobile marketing; Mobile technology; Purchase intention; Smartphone; Technology adoption","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84863804059"

Electronic word of mouth (eWOM) plays a crucial role in the success of e-commerce. Therefore, the main purpose of this study is to investigate a comprehensive moderated mediated mechanism for enhancing m-banking adoption behavior through positive eWOM triggers using the elaboration likelihood model (ELM). Argument Quality, valence, consistency and volume were considered eWOM triggers, and the conceptual model also included initial trust in m-banking as a mediator and consumer involvement in m-banking as a moderator. A total of 1153 useable surveys completed by the Indian users of social networking websites were used for analysis. The findings showed that of the triggers, argument quality, valence, and consistency enhance intention to adopt m-banking. These effects were mediated by initial trust in m-banking. The mediation effects of initial trust between valence – Intention varied between high and low consumer involvement in m-banking. These findings make several contributions to the literature on marketing communication, particularly to eWOM research and ELM theory. Practically, this study provides several recommendations to banks about how to use positive eWOM for motivating consumers to adopt m-banking. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Elaboration likelihood model; Electronic word of mouth; Initial trust; Mobile banking; Moderated mediation","India; banking; electronic commerce; financial services; mobile communication; technology adoption","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85071502011"

Design/methodology/approach: The paper is based on results of a survey conducted on a sample of 1,010 Polish consumers. The questionnaire included items to identify food choice motives, attributes of organic food and barriers to buy organic products. The data collected was analyzed with SPSS 15.0 using descriptive statistics and carrying out two step cluster analysis to identify consumers' segments. To get better insight into factors decisive to organic food consumption, the segments were profiled according to declared consumption of organic food. Findings: Sensory factors were the most important motives for food choice, followed by price and safety. Consumers with convenience and price orientation in their food choices were less inclined to buy organic products while consumers open to novelties and willing to try new foods more often declared to buy organic products. Polish consumers conceptualize organic food referring to aspects such as healthiness and safety. Despite the developments observed in the organic food sector in Poland, the information related that barriers to buy organic food still prevail. Research limitations/implications: The choice of validated scale items related to food choice and food related lifestyle was limited and there is a need to further explore Polish consumers food related lifestyle and its relation to organic food consumption. Cluster analysis used to identify segments is a method not based on probabilistic statistics, so it is the researcher's interpretation that is most relevant. Originality/value: Prior research concerning Polish consumers food choices with relation to organic food consumption is very limited. Such information is particularly pertinent to food manufacturers and distributors to support developing communication strategies to stimulate organic food market development in Poland. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Consumer behaviour; Food products; Organic foods; Poland","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-78651422125"

Managers who follow a product orientation focus on products that interest and inspire them rather than on products that fulfill consumers' desires. This research suggests that a consumer's perception that managers follow a product orientation is consistent with prior conceptualizations of brand authenticity. That research suggests that brands perceived as authentic are evaluated more positively, yet that research does not empirically assess brand authenticity's effects nor suggest its antecedents. To fill this gap, the authors develop a conceptualization and model of brand authenticity grounded in self-determination theory, attribution theory, and extant authentic human brand research. Brand authenticity is defined as the extent to which consumers perceive that a brand's managers are intrinsically motivated in that they are passionate about and devoted to providing their products. The model proposes four antecedents of brand authenticity-two related to rare brand behaviors (uniqueness and scarcity), and two related to stable brand behaviors (longevity and longitudinal consistency). It also proposes two perceptual outcomes of brand authenticity-expected quality and trust. Two 2 × 2 experiments (n = 136 for Study 1; n = 155 for Study 2) demonstrate a positive impact of the antecedents on brand authenticity and of brand authenticity on the outcomes. Brand authenticity mediates these effects. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84965149530"

This means that a packaging system format with a lower environmental impact that causes high food waste, may appear to be a better alternative than a packaging system with a higher environmental impact that reduces food waste. This can be contradictory to the purpose of using LCA to reduce overall environmental impacts, because food generally has a higher environmental impact than the packaging system. This paper highlights packaging attributes that may influence food waste, and demonstrates via six packaging scenarios how the environmental impact for the functional unit of ""eaten food"" can be calculated when food waste is included. The results show that the function of ""avoiding food waste"" is a critical packaging issue. The connection between packaging design and food waste should be acknowledged and valued by relevant stakeholders such as: food producers, manufacturers, brand owners, retailers and consumers, and also in packaging regulations. To fully explore the potential for packaging systems to reduce their overall environmental impact, food waste should be included. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

With its focus on cultivation of benevolent and clear-headed values and actions to self, others and the world, as well as its possible value in fostering greater coherence between values, attitudes and behavior, the concept of mindfulness has most recently attracted the interest of scholars in sustainable consumption research. So far, however, research on the connection between mindfulness and sustainable consumption is scattered across different disciplines and lacks integration. This paper contributes to a consolidation of the field. Based on a systematic literature review (Ninitial sample = 1137 publications, Npreliminary sample = 32, Nfinal sample = 7), it represents a stocktaking exercise to evaluate the research methodologies used and findings reported in the emerging field of empirical research relating mindfulness to sustainable consumption. The focus of the review is on four potential mechanisms of mindfulness for sustainable consumption that have been postulated in seminal conceptual works in the field: to disrupt routines, to promote more congruence with regard to the attitude-behavior gap, to nurture non-materialistic values, to enhance well-being, and to foster pro-social behavior. Preliminary evidence suggests support for these assumed potentials. However, the review also reveals that there are serious methodological challenges and shortcomings in existing empirical approaches, namely with regard to definitional issues, the development and use of instruments, selection of samples, study designs and the inclusion of mediating or moderating variables. The paper concludes with a discussion of challenges and recommendations for future work in the field. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Consumer behavior; Literature review; Meditation; Methodology; Mindfulness; Sustainable consumption","Industrial engineering; Production engineering; Literature reviews; Meditation; Methodology; Mindfulness; Sustainable consumption; Consumer behavior","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85024100312"

A banner with a hyperlink that connected to the author's web survey was posted on the homepage of Facebook. Of the 258 responses returned, 176 were fully completed. Measurement items were adapted from previous literature. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to evaluate the research model and hypotheses testing. The results of an empirical study supported the use of the stimuli-organism-response (S-O-R) model in a social networking site and showed how environmental features should be incorporated to enhance users' online experiences and purchase intentions. Specifically, social identity showed the strongest influence on involvement and flow. More specifically, affective involvement showed the greatest influence on purchase intention compared to flow and cognitive involvement. The relative importance of both interactivity and social identity in platform features in shaping consumers' online experiences should not be ignored. The author suggests online games or apps. Additionally, platform providers should advance social identity features that show a strong positive impact on users' online experiences. With the proliferation of online social gaming, there is growing evidence for virtual goods consumption; however, relatively few studies have discussed this phenomenon. This paper draws on hypotheses from environmental psychology; specifically, users' intentions to purchase are modeled on user responses to the online stimuli of a Web platform and the online experience that such an environment elicits. © 2012, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Customer behaviour; Flow; Interactivity; Involvement; Purchase intention; Social identity; Social networks; Virtual goods","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84861830455"

Thereafter, the aim is to identify how the resistance differs in these customer groups. Design/methodology/approach - This study identifies three groups of internet banking non-adopters, namely postponers, opponents and rejectors. The data were collected by conducting an extensive postal survey among the retail banking customers in Finland who had not adopted internet banking. The measurement development was based on consumer resistance theory and the earlier literature on internet banking. Principal component analysis was used to classify the resistance items into five adoption barriers derived from the earlier literature. Thereafter, analysis of variance was used to analyse the statistical differences in resistance to internet banking between the three groups. Findings - Significant differences were identified between the groups explored. The resistance of the rejectors is much more intense and diverse than that of the opponents, while the postponers show only slight resistance. The results also indicate that psychological barriers are even higher determinants of resistance than usage and value, which are constructs related to ease-of-use and usefulness determining acceptance in the traditional technology acceptance model. Moreover, the findings highlight the role of self-efficacy in bank customers' risk perceptions to internet banking. Originality/value - This study provides further understanding of what inhibits internet banking adoption by comparing three non-adopter groups with respect to their resistance to internet banking. It also has implications for management in overcoming non-adopters' resistance to the innovation. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Consumer behaviour; Internet; Virtual banking","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84978024629"

In addition, the authors seek to investigate the impact of two social factors (perceived crowding and employee friendliness) on unplanned purchases. Design/methodology/approach - A wide variety of retail outlets in Singapore were selected as the context for this field study, ranging from small cosmetics shops (e.g. Body Shop) to mega furniture outlets (i.e. IKEA). Findings - The results of this study indicate that perceived over-stimulation (higher than desired) has a positive impact on impulse buying. Moreover, the two social factors jointly influence consumers' unplanned purchases. Research limitations/implications - The sample size was relatively small (n=138) and data collection took place in Singapore. Thus, future research with a bigger sample and tested in other cultures is needed to enhance the generalizability of the findings. Practical implications - The study findings suggest that over-stimulation has a positive impact on impulse purchases. Store managers can look at a number of environmental design variables to increase stimulation in their shops. The findings further indicate that perceived crowding and employee friendliness jointly influence impulse buying, and hence these two factors need to be considered together in store design. Originality/value - Retailers are fully aware of the power of impulse buying in enhancing their revenues, yet little is known about how the store environment influences unplanned purchases.

The authors define an effective CJD as the extent to which consumers perceive multiple brand-owned touchpoints as designed in a thematically cohesive, consistent, and context-sensitive way. Analyzing consumer data from studies in two countries (4814 consumers in total), they provide evidence of the positive influence of an effective CJD on customer loyalty through brand attitude—over and above the effects of brand experience. Importantly, an effective CJD more strongly influences utilitarian brand attitudes, while brand experience more strongly affects hedonic brand attitudes. These underlying mechanisms are also prevalent when testing for the contingency factors services versus goods, perceived switching costs, and brand involvement. © 2019, Academy of Marketing Science.","Brand experience; Customer journey; Effective customer journey design; Scale development; Touchpoints","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85059660322"

For the consumer to be immersed in the story and to have an extraordinary experience, two preconditions are proposed which relate to the type of service and the setting: one is the need for the experience to take place in a hedonic service consumption setting and the other is a servicescape that allows the consumer to step away from everyday reality. It is also proposed that involvement and co-creation, as well as a guide, can be used to facilitate a tourist's immersion in a story and a servicescape. Should the organization succeed in creating a unique story, the benefits include the difficulty other organizations face copying the achievement and attention from the media.","Dramaturgy; Extraordinary experiences; Hospitality; Servicescape; Storytelling; Strategy","conceptual framework; consumption behavior; corporate strategy; service sector; tourism","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-57049086428"

Against this background, this paper endeavors to identify the salient features of the Islamic framework of International Marketing Ethics. In particular, it highlights the capabilities and strengths of this framework in creating and sustaining a strong ethical international marketing culture. At the heart of Islamic marketing is the principle of value-maximization based on equity and justice (constituting just dealing and fair play) for the wider welfare of the society. Selected key international marketing issues are examined from an Islamic perspective which, it is argued, if adhered to, can help to create a value-loaded global ethical marketing framework for MNCs in general, and establish harmony and meaningful cooperation between international marketers and Muslim target markets in particular.","Corporate responsibility; Corruption; Ethical behavior; Ethics; International marketing; Islam; Marketing mix; Regulatory institutions; Value-maximization","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-18044364803"

It further explains the role of knowledge as a moderating variable in organic food purchase intention. A total of 331 responses from Tanzania and 350 responses from Kenya were obtained. Confirmatory factor analysis was applied for validation, and results were analysed using structural equation modeling. SNs, personal attitudes, and health consciousness were found to be significant predictors of organic purchase intention in both countries. Furthermore, findings show that knowledge positively moderates the relationship among SNs, personal attitude, health consciousness, and organic food purchase intention. However, PBC was found to be a weak influencer on consumer purchase intention in Kenya, and no knowledge interaction between PBC and consumer purchase intention in Tanzania was found. The current study theoretically contributes to the literature by introducing the moderating role of knowledge in the relationship. The results show that knowledge interaction increases the effects of the majority of predictors after being introduced in the relationship.

However, the extent to which these potentials can be achieved depends on consumers’ disposition to sharing rides. From a travel behavior perspective, two essential elements to the adoption of shared rides are individuals’ acceptance of increased travel times associated with pick-up/drop-off of other passengers and their approval of strangers sharing the same vehicle. The current study develops the notion of willingness to share (WTS), which represents the money value attributed by an individual to traveling alone compared to riding with strangers, to investigate the adoption of shared rides. Using a multivariate integrated choice and latent variable approach, we examine current choices and future intentions regarding the use of shared rides and estimate individuals’ WTS as well as their values of travel time for two distinct trip purposes. Results show that users are less sensitive to the presence of strangers when in a commute trip compared to a leisure-activity trip. We also observe that the travel time added to the trip to serve other passengers may be a greater barrier to the use of shared services compared to the presence of a stranger. However, the potential to use travel time productively may help overcome this barrier especially for high-income individuals. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Automated vehicles; Dynamic ridesharing; Ride-hailing; Value of travel time; Willingness to share","Autonomous vehicles; Automated vehicles; Leisure activities; Ride-hailing; Ride-sharing; Traffic conditions; Vehicle occupancies; Vehicle-miles traveled; Willingness to share; modeling; public transport; road transport; travel behavior; travel time; unmanned vehicle; Travel time","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85063919679"

These studies showed that when the social-solitary and experiential-material dimensions were considered simultaneously, social discretionary spending was favored over solitary discretionary spending, whereas experiences showed no happiness-producing advantage relative to possessions. Furthermore, whereas spending money on socially shared experiences was valued more than spending money on either experiences enacted alone or material possessions, solitary experiences were no more valued than material possessions.

We show evidence that it does, demonstrating its effect on economic outcomes across a range of experiments in real-world environments. A field experiment in an online labor market indicates that workers request systematically lower reservation wages when the employer shares their political stance, reflecting a preference to work for co-partisans. We conduct two field experiments with consumers and find a preference for dealing with co-partisans, especially among those with strong partisan attachments. Finally, via a population-based, incentivized survey experiment, we find that the influence of political considerations on economic choices extends also to weaker partisans.

The past few years have witnessed a growing interest among scholars to examine the behavioral issues concerning e-waste recycling. However, most of the existing studies have focused on adopting e-waste recycling and related innovations. It is already known that ‘reasons for’ and ‘reasons against’ the adoption of any innovation are quantitatively different. The current study bridges this gap by utilizing a novel consumer behavior framework called behavioral reasoning theory (BRT) to study e-waste recycling attitudes and intentions. The study examined the relative influence of ‘reasons for’ and ‘reasons against’ in predicting attitude and intentions within the context of e-waste recycling by using a single framework. The developed model was tested using structural equation modeling with 774 Japanese consumers. The study also examined the moderating role of environmental assessment and environmental concerns in influencing the studied associations. The results suggest that ‘reasons for’ was positively associated with attitude and intentions. The consumer values shared negative associations only with ‘reasons against.’ The study findings offer interesting insights for service providers, policymakers, and governments. © 2020 The Author(s)","Behavioral reasoning theory (BRT); Consumer values; Consumers; e-waste recycling; Environmental concerns; Use intentions","Consumer behavior; Electronic equipment; Recycling; Wastes; Behavioral reasoning; Consumer value; Developed model; E-waste recycling; Environmental assessment; Environmental concerns; Service provider; Structural equation modeling; Electronic Waste","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85091987300"

Research on the antecedents of sustainable consumer behaviour has found a robust ""gender effect"": women are more likely than men to express concern about consumption's broader impacts and to act upon those concerns. The mechanisms underlying the gender effect have not been well elucidated. At the same time, more limited research has found that sustainable consumer behaviour is also influenced by personality: more agreeable and more open consumers are more likely to place importance on and to act on social and environmental concerns. Separate research in personality psychology has shown that women tend to be more agreeable than men. The authors integrate these findings to propose and test a model in which personality mediates the effect of sex on sustainable consumer behaviour. The personality differences mediating this effect are the same ones elsewhere subsumed within ""gender"" differences. Our findings clarify the mechanisms underlying the observed sex effect, confirm the utility of personality constructs in clarifying differences in consumer attitudes and behaviours, and have compelling implications for public policy. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Gender; Personality; Sex; Sustainable consumption","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84857455967"

This research seeks to unravel the critical determinants that influence consumers’ impulsive buying in livestreaming. Grounded in the Stimulus-Organism-Response paradigm, a framework is proposed to elucidate the underlying mechanism on how parasocial interaction, social contagion, vicarious experience, scarcity persuasion, and price perception translate into impulsive buying urge and behaviour in livestreaming commerce via the cognitive-affective processing system. A self-administered online questionnaire survey was conducted with 295 respondents. The data collected was validated empirically through a multi-analytical hybrid structural equation modelling-artificial neural network (SEM-ANN) technique. The results reveal that parasocial interaction, vicarious experience, scarcity persuasion, and price perception can drive cognitive and affective reactions, which in turn, induce impulsive buying urge, subject to the boundary condition of impulsive buying tendency. In sum, the findings have drawn some insightful theoretical and practical implications that can facilitate the advancement of livestreaming commerce in the modern business arena. © 2022 The Author(s)","Impulsive buying; Livestreaming commerce; Parasocial interaction; Vicarious experience","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85129462328"

Experiential tourism activities such as mountaineering evoke powerful emotions that strongly influence tourist satisfaction. Although Zajonc (1980) proposed and more recent neurophysiological evidence confirms that emotions, especially fear, can be primary (can precede cognitions), consumption-related emotions have heretofore been modeled as occurring concurrently with or consequent to cognitive appraisals. Our results show that two basic consumption-related emotions, fear and joy, are influenced by neuroticism and extraversion, respectively, and in turn and in conjunction with cognitive appraisals influence tourist satisfaction. Joy has direct effects on satisfaction that are not mediated by cognitions; fear's inverse effects on satisfaction are fully mediated by cognitions. These findings extend understandings of trait/basic-emotion relationships and of basic emotions' roles in satisfaction formation and also, importantly, demonstrate an instance of primary consumer emotions. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Cognition-affect; Customer satisfaction; Emotions; Fear; Personality; Unconscious processing","cognition; consumption behavior; recreational activity; tourist behavior","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-79960296428"

Household appliances are highly utilized products that consume considerable electricity. The wide adoption of energy-saving appliances saves power resources and promotes the development of low-carbon economy. However, energy-saving appliances are usually more expensive than ordinary household appliances, thereby hindering their widespread adoption. Therefore, the factors influencing consumers’ willingness to pay a price premium for energy-saving appliances should be explored. A comprehensive model was constructed based on the theory of planned behavior and consumer perceived value literature. The influencing factors were identified in terms of product, consumer, and regulation and publicity. Data were collected through questionnaire survey method, as it is suitable for collecting data on human beliefs and perceptions. 327 valid responses were obtained from the survey, and the data were analyzed using partial least squares. Results show that consumers’ attitude toward purchasing energy-saving appliances positively impacts willingness to pay a price premium. Consumer perceived quality, price, emotional, and environmental values significantly and positively impact consumers’ purchasing attitude. Furthermore, the perceived effectiveness of energy efficiency labeling institutional mechanism and personal norm significantly and positively influences consumers’ purchasing attitude. Nevertheless, social value, environmental awareness, and media publicity do not significantly affect consumers’ purchasing attitude. Finally, suggestions on how to promote energy-saving appliances were proposed. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Energy efficiency labeling; Energy-saving appliances; Perceived value; Price premium; Theory of planned behavior; Willingness to pay","Climate change; Consumer behavior; Domestic appliances; Economics; Energy utilization; Least squares approximations; Renewable energy resources; Sales; Surveys; Energy efficiency labeling; Perceived value; Price premiums; Theory of Planned Behavior; Willingness to pay; Energy efficiency","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85072629810"

Among studies exploring the social environment, the emphasis has been on service employees, ignoring the impact of other customers. Recent research has further called for the need to include displayed emotion within the social environment. Therefore, this study aims to develop and test a more comprehensive model that focuses on the relationship between the social environment (employee displayed emotion and customer climate) and the physical environment (ambient and design factors) and resulting customer emotion and service outcomes. Design/methodology/approach: Based on past research, a theoretical framework was developed to propose the links between social/physical environments and customer emotion/perceptions. Extant research from various academic fields, including environmental psychology, was reviewed, deriving 11 hypotheses. Data collected from fashion apparel retailers, using both observation and customer survey methods, was examined through structural equation modeling (SEM). Findings: Results show that both social and physical environments have a positive influence on customer emotion and satisfaction, which in turn affect behavioral intentions. The physical environment exhibited more influence on customer emotion and satisfaction than social environment. Research limitations/implications: This research explains how both social and physical environments affect customer emotion and perceptions. Future research directions are discussed, with an emphasis on incorporating customer characteristics, industry attributes, and cultural variables to better understand the influence of service environments in different service settings. Practical implications: Social and physical environments influence customer emotional states within the service delivery context, which in turn affect customer service evaluations. Therefore, both social and physical service environments should be emphasized by service firms. Originality/value: This research represents an early attempt to develop a more comprehensive model explaining how both social and physical environments affect customer emotion and perceptions. This study also represents the first empirical study of service environment research to include employee displayed emotion as part of the social environment. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Consumer behaviour; Customer emotion; Customer service management; Physical environments; Service environments; Service outcomes; Social environment","","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-79960058501"

Design/methodology/approach - An integrated model was proposed on the basis of the technology acceptance model (TAM) and expectation confirmation model (ECM), focussing on perceived value (PV). The survey responses of 203 Chinese mobile shoppers (m-shoppers) were analysed using structural equation modelling with the partial least squares approach. Findings - The results indicated that perceived usefulness does not motivate all user groups. Furthermore, satisfaction and perceived ease of use significantly impacted different user groups. For online food m-shoppers, value for money (VM) was the most important factor influencing satisfaction and CI. However, perceived usefulness only affected CI for non-food m-shoppers. Practical implications - Marketers can improve users' CI by enhancing VM and maximising effectiveness and enjoyment while minimising prices. Moreover, in determining strategies for different users, marketers should identify the behavioural differences among all groups and those between the two classified groups. Originality/value - This is one of the studies attempting to explain Chinese mobile shopping consumers' CI, but especially through an integrated model based on TAM and ECM with PV on food and non-food m-commerce perspective.

Drawing on speech act theory, this study provides a fine-grained analysis of the implicit and explicit language used by consumers to express sentiment in text. An empirical text-mining study using more than 45,000 consumer reviews demonstrates the differential impacts of activation levels (e.g., tentative language), implicit sentiment expressions (e.g., commissive language), and discourse patterns (e.g., incoherence) on overall consumer sentiment (i.e., star ratings). In two follow-up studies, we demonstrate that these speech act features also influence the readers' behavior and are generalizable to other social media contexts, such as Twitter and Facebook.

Social marketing is conceptualized as the design, implementation, and control of programs seeking to increase the acceptability of a social ideal or practice in a target group. These problems can occur in 8 basic decision-making areas: market analysis, market segmentation, product strategy development, pricing strategy development, channel strategy development, communications strategy development, organizational design and planning, and evaluation. Social marketers find that they have less good secondary data about their consumers, more problems obtaining valid and reliable measures of relevant variables, more difficulty sorting out the relative influence of determinants of consumer behavior, and more problems getting consumer research funded than marketers in the commercial sector. They tend to have less flexibility in shaping their products and more difficulty formulating product concepts. Problems associated with establishing, utilizing, and controlling distribution channels comprise another major difference between social and more conventional forms of marketing. Social marketers also find that their communications options are somewhat limited as a result of problems associated with use of paid advertisements, pressures not to use certain types of appeals in their messages, and the need to communicate large amounts of information in their messages. Moreover, social marketers must function in organizations where marketing activities are poorly understood, underappreciated, and inappropriately located. Finally, they face problems trying to define effectiveness measures or estimating the contribution their program has made toward the achievement of certain objectives. If all these problems are anticipated and handled creatively, social marketing efforts can succeed.","","Commerce; Economics; Marketing of Health Services; Private Sector; Public Sector; Commerce; Economic Factors; Macroeconomic Factors; Marketing; Private Sector; Public Sector; Social Marketing; article; commercial phenomena; Economic Factors; economics; financial management; Macroeconomic Factors; marketing; organization and management; social marketing","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0019534147"

In particular, the problem of whether to expand the electricity power stations and distribution facilities due to the construction of EV charging stations is emerging as an immediate issue. To effectively meet the demand for additional electricity while ensuring the stability of the power grid, there is a need to accurately predict the charging demands for EVs. Therefore, this study estimates the changes in electricity charging demand based on consumer preferences for EVs, charging time of day, and types of electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) and elucidates the matters to be considered for constructing EV infrastructure. The results show that consumers mainly preferred charging during the evening. However, when we considered different types of EVSEs (public and private) in the analysis, people preferred to charge at public EVSEs during the day. During peak load time, people tended to prefer charging using fast public EVSEs, which shows that consumers considered the tradeoffs between the full charge time and the price for charging. Based on these findings, this study provides key political implications for policy makers to consider in taking preemptive measures to adjust the electricity supply infrastructure. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Consumer preference; Discrete choice experiment; Electric vehicle charging pattern; Electric vehicle supply equipment; Electricity demand","Charging (batteries); Electric power transmission networks; Electric power utilization; Electric vehicles; Consumer preferences; Discrete choice experiments; Electric vehicle charging; Electric vehicle supply equipments; Electricity demands; discrete choice analysis; electric vehicle; electricity generation; electricity supply; infrastructure; preference behavior; smart grid; Electric power system stability","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85044792052"

This paper specifically examines how and why consumers are influenced by restrictive navigation cues on the web. Essentially, the present author proposes that restrictive navigational cues act as barriers that threaten consumers' control over web navigation, which, in turn, arouses psychological reactance and leads to negative consequences for the web marketer. These negative consequences include increased levels of negative emotions, negative attitudes toward the web site and increased site avoidance behavior. The magnitude of the threat to control, consumers' expectation of control and the importance of web navigation are proposed to moderate this relationship. The reduction in navigational control associated with restrictive navigation cues is also posited to reduce the likelihood of the consumer flow experience, which, in turn, leads to negative attitudes and site avoidance behavior.

A survey of 465 adult consumers measured global innovativeness, domain-specific innovativeness for two product categories (clothing and electronics) and self-reported purchase of new clothing and electronic items. Three hypotheses were tested. First, global innovativeness is more highly correlated with domain-specific innovativeness than it is with the purchase of new items. Second, domain-specific innovativeness is more highly correlated with the purchase of new items than is global innovativeness. Finally, the association between global innovativeness and new product purchase is mediated by domain-specific innovativeness.

Taking into account the locale specific characteristics of consumers’ E-waste disposal behaviour and awareness, we have attempted to perform an extensive review on the global context and identify the measures adopted by the consumers of different countries to dispose off their E-waste. We observe significant differences in consumers’ E-waste disposal behaviour not only ‘between’ the developed and developing countries, but also ‘within’ these countries. The paper further especially explains the complexities in India's E-waste management system due to its multifaceted socio-economic, cultural and other associated connotations influencing consumers’ disposal behaviour and awareness.

Yet, there are indications that consumers do not always act on these concerns, causing an attitude–behaviour gap. For consumers to make ecologically responsible purchases, they need relevant product environmental information. Therefore, marketers and firms are increasingly integrating more detailed environmental information in their offerings, including eco-labels with externally validated information. This study integrates consumers’ knowledge and trust in eco-labels with their environmental knowledge to determine how these affect pro-environmental consumer behaviour (PECB). The findings suggest environmental and eco-label knowledge is positively associated with attitudes towards the environment, and that positive environmental attitudes and trust in eco-labels affect PECB. This implies that firms, policy-makers and accreditation organisations (i.e. labelling) can educate consumers about eco-labels and the environment to increase PECB. Such strategies will also build consumer knowledge and trust in eco-labels, necessary for facilitating PECB. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Consumer behaviour; eco-label; knowledge; marketing communication; pro-environmental; trust","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84990961113"

It is suggested that innovation resistance can no longer be regarded as a potentially negative aspect of target markets for new goods and services but rather a response based on rational choices. From a managerial perspective the reasons why new products are not accepted, which may be identified from a qualitative research approach, should prove useful in further new product development. © 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Prior research on kindchenschema (baby schema) has found that exposure to cute babies or baby animals leads to more careful behavior (see the study by Sherman, Haidt, and Coan), suggesting restraint. The present research uncovers the opposite: consumers become more indulgent in their behavior after exposure to whimsically cute products. Drawing from research on cognitive priming, kindchenschema, anthropomorphization, indulgence, and regulatory focus, this research posits that exposure to whimsically cute products primes mental representations of fun, increasing consumers' focus on approaching self-rewards and making consumers more likely to choose indulgent options. These effects do not emerge for kindchenschema cute stimuli, since they prime mental representations of vulnerability and caretaking. Four empirical studies provide evidence for the proposed effects and their underlying process. © 2014 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84904177435"

Among other ideas, the notion of what it means for a group member to intend that the group act and how individual intentions are contributory to group action are discussed.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0034345981"

As such, the concept of circular economy, which seeks to ‘design out’ waste by better products, practices and business models, is deemed to be very relevant for e-products. The nature of circular systems mandates a collective effort of businesses, consumers, and governments. While the techno-economic sides of the circular economy have attracted large attention in recent years, the role of consumer behavior – a critical factor in defining the long-term success of ‘sustainable production and consumption’ initiatives – remains less explored. In this context, this paper explores the potential of integrating lessons from behavioral sciences to facilitate circular economy in e-waste management. It offers a review of prominent behavioral theories and their application in the context of sustainable consumption and pro-environmental behaviors. Finally, the paper identifies opportunities for behavioral interventions in improving e-waste management and in achieving a more circular economy. © 2020 The Authors","Behavior change; Circular economy; Consumer behavior; E-waste; Electronic waste; Sustainable consumption; WEEE","Electronic equipment; Electronic Waste; Product design; Sustainable development; Wastes; Behavior change; Behavioral interventions; Circular economy; Electrical and electronic products; Pro-environmental behaviors; Resource sustainability; Sustainable consumption; WEEE; behavioral response; consumption behavior; electronic waste; European Union; sustainability; waste management; attention; behavior change; behavioral science; consumer attitude; e-waste; economic aspect; human; review; Consumer behavior","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85081220109"

Design/methodology/approach - A quantitative research design was adopted for this study. An extensive and critical review of literature related to consumer satisfaction emotions and consumer behavioral intentions led to the identification of two research questions. A self-completion questionnaire was developed and administered to hospitality management graduates in Switzerland. Findings - The PCA suggested that satisfaction emotions were best conceptualized as a three-dimensional construct that included positive, negative and what the present authors have labeled ""bi-directional"" emotions. Moreover, a positive statistically significant relationship between ""bi-directional"" emotions and consumer complaining behavior was established through correlation analysis. Research limitations/implications - The respondents were studying at a private institution in Switzerland, and as such, the socio-economic background of the respondents may not be representative of education consumers generally, and of consumers of services in industries other than education. Practical implications - The findings reported in this paper indicate that the emotions framework that was developed could provide a valuable resource for managers as segmentation tool, and as an instrument for measuring and monitoring consumer behavioral intentions. Originality/value - This paper has identified a relationship between specific satisfaction emotions and consumer complaining behavior. As a consequence, a more comprehensive satisfaction emotions scale has been developed that captures a broader range of consumer behavioral intentions.

In particular, it investigates the main factors explaining organic food demand in the South of Italy. Following the Lancaster consumer's demand theory we assume that consumer's utility depends on product characteristics instead of the product itself. Thus, consumers will choose the product (organic versus conventional) that possesses the combination of attributes that maximises its utility. Consumer's choice for organic foods is analysed within the random utility discrete choice model and a bivariate probit model has been specified. The data were collected through a questionnaire conducted in the Italian region of Campania (Naples) in 2003. Findings indicate that economic factors are still factors limiting the growth of organic demand in Europe. Moreover, the consumers' perceived benefits of organic food (environmental and health) are factors promoting organic food demand. In addition, greater information on organic food products is crucial to expand its demand in the South of Italy because this information will increase the consumer's organic knowledge. Then, higher organic knowledge will increase the probability to buy organic foods and, to a larger extent, the level of consumption among existing consumers. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

A confirmatory factor analysis was conducted to check the validity and reliability of the scales. Hypotheses were tested using multiple regression analysis. Findings: The findings showed that only store-related attributes of eco-fashion positively influence consumers' eco-fashion consumption decision, yet, such relationship can be weakened by the price premium level of eco-fashion. Research limitations/implications: Fashion consumers' response to product- and store-related attributes of eco-fashion is still important in predicting fashion consumers' eco-fashion consumption decision.

No longer is the emergence of imitation products confined to branded luxury goods and final markets. Counterfeit articles are increasingly finding their way into other sectors, including the fast-moving consumer goods, pharmaceutical, and automotive industries - with, in part, severe negative consequences for consumers, licit manufacturers, and brand owners alike. This paper seeks to shed light on the economic principles of counterfeit trade and the underlying illicit supply chains. Design/methodology/approach: An extensive literature review was conducted that comprised contributions from different strands of management research. Findings: Though governments as well as management have clearly identified the problem, very little is known - both in practice and theory - about the mechanisms and structure of the illicit market, the tactics of counterfeit producers, consumer behavior with respect to imitation products and the financial impact on individual companies. The diversity of the counterfeit phenomenon underlines the need for further research in this area and the development of company-specific measures for fighting product piracy. Research limitations/implications: The clandestine nature of the counterfeit market limits direct accessibility to the phenomenon. Consequently, the existing body of literature does not necessarily cover all aspects of counterfeit activities. The review helps to highlight existing research gaps but may not be able to identify additional aspects of the phenomenon that, thus far, have not been deemed relevant. Originality/value: The paper critically reviews the current state of research across different management-related disciplines. From an academic perspective it may serve as a starting point for a future research agenda that addresses the current knowledge gaps. From a practitioner's perspective it is helpful for understanding the relevant influence factors and for developing appropriate, state-of-the-art counterstrategies. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Business ethics; Counterfeiting; Supply and demand; Trade","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-69849094149"

The self-concept is, however, significant and relevant to the study of consumer behavior because many purchases made by consumers are directly influenced by the image an individual has of himself. A fundamental question involves the process of the formation of the self-concept. Several distinct qualities exist within the selfconcept, and once the self-concept is established, these have a bearing upon the individual's behavior and his relationship with his objective, subjective, social, and ideal self. For marketers, an understanding of the self-concept and selfimage can provide the means for developing more effective marketing programs. Consistency and congruence also play an important part in establishing the relationship between the selfconcept, the individual's image, and final purchase behavior. Other factors also play a part in the process and, in some situations, misunderstandings about their importance can result in less than effective marketing efforts. Careful research and analysis of the relevant factors affecting the self-concept and their effect on purchase behavior can make for more effective market strategic planning. This article examines the various issues related to the marketing applicability of the self-concept and discusses its implications in terms of research and market strategic planning. © 1987 MCB UP Limited","","","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84898995526"

Design/methodology/approach: The study relies on face-to-face personal interviews in the context of grocery store retailing. Findings: The results identify the significant predictors of consumer-firm emotional attachment to be firm trust, trust in employees, likeability of service personnel and likeability of co-consumers, shopping enjoyment, self-expressiveness, place dependence, and place identity. Consumers' self-enrichment, self-gratification and self-enablement likely influence emotional attachment, which in turn is a strong predictor of behavioral loyalty and word of mouth. Attachment anxiety appears to multiply the effects of emotional attachment on behavioral loyalty and word of mouth. Research limitations/implications: The cross-sectional nature of the study precludes definitive conclusions concerning causality between the constructs utilized. The data come from the supermarket retail channel, limiting the generalizibility of the results. Practical implications: As the results suggest that the consumer's self-enrichment seems to be the most important factor in determining emotional attachment, managers should incorporate the notion of emotional attachment into strategic performance management systems. Originality/value: The study incorporates the notion of consumer heterogeneity into the relationship anxiety construct, arguing in favor of a non-additive consumer-firm emotional attachment nomological network. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Buyer-seller relationships; Consumer behaviour; Customer loyalty; Retailing","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-77956201380"

In addition to strongly supporting the validity of the model, results suggest that country image cognitive processing is significantly more complex than previously thought, and that culture appears to play an important role in purchase decisions. The flexible model represents a substantive improvement in the depiction of cognitive processing regarding country-of-origin image.","Consumer behaviour; Country of origin; International marketing; Japan; National cultures","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0442298841"

This study draws upon the Uses and Gratifications (UG) and Media System Dependency (MSD) perspectives to examine in this process the role played by satisfaction with care. The sample comprised 178 cancer listserv users, of whom 35% chose the Internet as their preferred source of health information compared with 19% who named their oncologist. Dissatisfied patients were significantly more likely to rate the Internet as a better source of information than the provider (p=.001). The level of empathy shown by the provider and the quality of time spent with the patient had a significant negative association with choosing the Internet as a preferred source of information, and a significant positive association with choosing the oncologist as an information source. The results from this study emphasize the significance of the patient-provider interaction. Dissatisfied patients' tendency to seek and trust information sources other than their physician also may have implications for compliance with treatment.

Yet targeting also creates negative consumer reactions, and websites confront increasing regulatory pressures to inform consumers about their practices. It is critical for such advertising-supported websites to address those challenges proactively. In one scenario experiment and two field studies, the authors show that a normative reciprocity argument is generally more effective than the current industry practice of using a utilitarian argument related to advertising relevance to increase acceptance of targeted online advertising.

Millions of people participate in popular sharing economy platforms (SEPs) such as Airbnb and Uber. Although sharing economy research has gained interest, yet a holistic model that explains the formation of consumer value co-creation intentions on such platforms remains absent. The purpose of this study is to develop a model of the antecedents of consumers value co-creation intentions at SEPs and evaluate it empirically. Building on social support theory, relationship quality theory, value co-creation and marketing ethics literature, we propose a theoretical model that explains the formation of consumers’ value co-creation intentions. Empirical data was collected from n = 342 Generation Y consumers and analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM). The results reveal that social support influences ethical perceptions, which further influences value co-creation. Ethical perceptions also influence consumers' trust, satisfaction and commitment with the SEP. However, trust and commitment do not influence value co-creation intentions. Our study contributes to the literature on sharing economy by providing a holistic model of the antecedents of consumers’ value co-creation intentions. We also offer important insights for SEP managers. © 2019 The Authors","Ethics; Relationship quality; Sharing economy; Social support; Value co-creation","Philosophical aspects; Ethics; Relationship qualities; Sharing economy; Social support; Value co creations; consumption behavior; ethics; perception; Consumer behavior","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077542214"

Preference-based segments were constructed using latent-class analysis of discrete choice experiment data. Potential PEV buyers were split into a ""PEV-enthusiast"" segment (8% of the sample) with extremely high valuation of PEVs and a broader ""PHEV-oriented"" segment (25%) that expressed moderately positive valuation of PHEVs. Preference-based segments also varied by respondents' valuation of specific attributes such as fuel savings. Our second approach constructed lifestyle-based segments using cluster analysis on a subset of potential early PEV buyers (33% of the total sample). The six lifestyle-based clusters varied in engagement in environment- and technology-oriented lifestyles, environmental concern and openness to change. Overall preferences were fairly similar across the clusters, though apparent motivations varied substantially by cluster as indicated by their differing engagement in lifestyles and environmental concern. Taken together, both approaches suggest that PHEVs are the most likely PEV to have broad market appeal and that car buyers have high degrees of heterogeneity in both preferences and motivations. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Cluster analysis; Consumer preference; Discrete choice model; Electric vehicle; Latent class analysis; Lifestyle; Preference heterogeneity","Canada; Cluster analysis; Electric vehicles; Environmental technology; Fuel economy; Motivation; Sales; Surveys; Vehicles; Consumer preferences; Discrete choice models; Latent class analysis; Lifestyle; Preference heterogeneity; cluster analysis; consumption behavior; discrete choice analysis; electric vehicle; heterogeneity; lifestyle; Plug-in hybrid vehicles","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84930940495"

Also, it seems that technology will expand in this era at an unprecedented rate. Therefore, it is of critical importance to understand the factors that influence the acceptance of technology by older people. The positive impact that the use of mobile applications can have for older people was confirmed by a previous study (Plaza et al., 2011). The study reported here aimed to explore and confirm, for older adults in China, the key influential factors of smartphone acceptance, and to describe the personal circumstances of Chinese older adults who use smartphone. A structured questionnaire and face to face individual interviews were used with 120 Chinese older adults (over 55). Structural Equation Modeling was used to confirm a proposed smartphone acceptance model based on Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), and the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT). The results showed that those who were younger, with higher education, non-widowed, with better economic condition related to salary or family support were more likely to use smartphone. Also, cost was found to be a critical factor influencing behavior intention.

Electronic sensors are now ubiquitous in our smartphones, cars, homes, electric systems, health-care devices, fitness monitors, and workplaces. These connected, sensor-based devices create new types and unprecedented quantities of detailed, high-quality information about our everyday actions, habits, personalities, and preferences. Much of this undoubtedly increases social wel-fare. For example, insurers can price automobile coverage more accurately by using sensors to measure exactly how you drive (e.g., Progressive’s Snapshot system), which should theoretically lower the overall cost of insurance. But the Internet of Things raises new and difficult questions as well. This Article shows that four inherent aspects of sensor-based technologies—the compounding effects of what computer scientists call “sensor fusion,” the near impossibility of truly de-identifying sensor data, the likelihood that Internet of Things devices will be inherently prone to security flaws, and the difficulty of meaningful consumer consent in this context—create very real discrimination, privacy, security, and consent problems. As connected, sensor- based devices tell us more and more about ourselves and each other, what discrimination—racial, economic, or otherwise—will that permit, and how should we constrain socially obnoxious manifestations? As the Internet of Things generates ever more massive and nuanced datasets about consumer behavior, how to protect privacy? How to deal with the reality that sensors are particularly vulnerable to security risks? How should the law treat—and how much should policy depend upon—consumer consent in a context in which true informed choice may be impossible? This Article is the first legal work to describe the new connected world we are creating, address these four interrelated problems, and propose concrete first steps for a regulatory approach to the Internet of Things. © 2014, School of Law Publications.

Is the recent upsurge in organic cotton products another fashion trend or is there a segment of consumers genuinely interested in purchasing organic cotton apparel based on the benefits of organic agriculture to the environment? Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected with a mail survey of US health and natural foods consumers. Conjoint analysis revealed salient product attributes and cluster analysis identified segments of consumers with different attribute preferences. Factor analysis uncovered latent variables from among the large number of items and the clusters were examined for differences in their psychographic profiles. Findings - It was found that the 38 percent of consumers who found used organic cotton content salient had positive attitudes toward organic and sustainable agriculture, preferred to ""buy locally"" and had a strong self-identity as environmental, organic, and socially responsible consumers. Research limitations/implications - The sample of US health and natural foods consumers means that the results cannot be generalized too widely. Research is currently under way to relate the self-reported purchase behavior of organic apparel consumers discussed here to actual purchase behavior. Practical implications - Survey respondents interested in purchasing organic cotton apparel agreed that organic farming is good for the environment, suggesting that consumers would be receptive to marketing messages that place an emphasis on the environmental benefits of purchasing organic cotton apparel.

Marketing scholars have used scientific approaches to discover and document a number of regularities pertaining to consumer behavior and marketing exchanges. Many regularities that have been empirically validated have achieved the status of ""lawlike generalizations."" In this article, the authors first classify these generalizations into four categories: location centric, time centric, market centric, and competition centric. They then argue that each category is now being affected by at least one major contextual discontinuity that is likely to challenge the relevance, if not validity, of these well-accepted lawlike generalizations. The authors also identify important questions stemming from these discontinuities and issue a call for further research to discover new insights and paradigms.

We review 25 years of research in physiobehavior, arguing that it can be extended in a natural way to predict that consumers are more likely to switch between sensory attributes (e.g., flavor) than nonsensory attributes (e.g., brand). Specifically, we examine the work on sensory-specific satiety, a term used to describe the phenomenon whereby the pleasantness of a food just eaten drops significantly while the pleasantness of uneaten foods remains unchanged. These findings lead to the thesis explored in this research that consumers are more likely to seek variety on sensory attributes, which is then tested across three studies comparing flavor switching to brand switching. Study 1 uses ACNielsen wand panel data for purchases of tortilla chips and cake mixes from almost 2,000 consumers over a three-year period. Study 2 examines actual consumption behavior using a six-week consumption diary panel from over 850 consumers in two cities. Heterogeneity across the samples in terms of the observed effects is examined in both studies. Study 3 employs a survey methodology to ascertain whether the differential role of flavor-based versus brand-based variety seeking is mediated by factors other than sensory-specific satiety. The findings strongly support the relevance of sensory-specific satiety to attribute-level variety seeking. Across the three studies, consumers switched more intensively on flavor than brand in 14 of the 15 categories examined and other factors such as preference heterogeneity and perceived risk fail to explain this difference.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0035540381"

There it is stated (1) that the individual is able to evaluate his income level on a zero-one scale in a cardinal way, and (2) that the resulting evaluation U(y) of a steady income stream at level y under specific assumptions is approximately equal to λ (y; μ, σ2), where λ is a lognormal distribution function with parameters μ, σ2. In this paper these statements are empirically investigated on the basis of a consumer survey conducted by the Belgian Consumer Union. Moreover, approximate relationships between the values of μ, σ2 and several variables, such as income, family size, age, job, stability of income, etc., have been derived. It turns out that σ2 is an individual constant, but that μ can be explained for a considerable part by the variables family size and income level. Most notable is the dependence of the individual's welfare evaluation on income, a phenomenon that is called ""preference drift.""

Most specifically, this study explores how individual employee differences moderate the influence of CSR on employee behavior. Using self-reports of 378 employees we examined how employees' collectivist orientation moderates the relationship of CSR on knowledge sharing behavior through organizational identification. Three of the four components (i.e., community, employees, and consumers) of CSR positively affect employees' organizational identification and knowledge-sharing behavior. However, while the effects of community-related CSR actions on the employees' outcomes are stronger for individualistic employees, the effect of employee-related CSR actions on organizational identification is stronger for collectivist employees. The findings are unique in the sense that we show empirically that different employees are influenced by different types of CSR actions. The study therefore suggests that the internal affects of CSR activities depend on the nature of the employees witnessing them. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Collectivism; Corporate social responsibility; Employees' knowledge sharing behavior; Organizational identification","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84922433363"

The objective of this paper is to review existing mechanistic models for predicting VOC and SVOC emissions from various sources, investigate their differences and similarities, and discuss the mass-transfer mechanisms on which the models are constructed. Because the usefulness of the emission models largely depends on the availability and reliability of model parameters, techniques for estimating key model parameters are also reviewed. The models covered in this review fall into three categories: models for VOC emissions from solid materials; models for VOC emissions from liquid materials; and models for SVOC emissions. VOC and SVOC emissions can be modeled within a consistent mass-transfer framework with the three model categories being intimately related.

Three sets of variables were examined in relationship to these responses: characteristics of the product problem, perceptions of the redress environment, and consumer characteristics. Complaint behavior and intention to switch brands showed strongest relationships with the first two types of variables. Word of mouth, on the other hand, seemed to be more heavily influenced by the consumer's level of social interaction, a consumer characteristic.

Existing research has established that trust, satisfaction and the attitude towards the brand contribute to the development of brand loyalty. However, recently, there is a growing stream of research indicating that the brands are not only facilitating transaction but companies can also use them to develop and maintain links with their customers. The exploration of the role of brands in the development of bonds with the customers is still very limited. Design/methodology/approach – Data were collected from 189 women who are using lipstick in Glasgow, Scotland. Respondents were asked to answer a questionnaire keeping in mind their preferred brand. Findings – The findings revealed that the strength of the consumer brand relationship is a very strong predictor of brand loyalty. They also suggested that brand relationship does not moderate the relationship between brand trust, satisfaction and brand loyalty, but it mediates the link amongst these constructs. Research limitations/implications – One product category was examined. The data were collected from females in a big city with non-probabilistic sampling. Most of the respondents were younger consumers, who may have different behavior compared to older consumers. Practical implications – Managers are constantly looking for ways to increase brand loyalty. They need to appreciate the importance of consumer engagement with their brand through positive brand relationships. Therefore, they need to try to develop brand identities and project brand images that will make the brands look as appealing to the consumers as relationship partners. Originality/value – This paper supports the view that brands are not only facilitating transactions but can also develop and maintain links with their customers, especially engaged customers, and the exploration of these bonds is still limited. This paper is adding to the literature on brand engagement and brand relationships from a quantitative perspective and is contributing to theory building, as there is no clear theoretical view on whether the brand relationship has a direct effect, i.e. either mediates or moderates the link between these variables. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Brand evaluation; Brand loyalty; Brand relationships; Brands; Consumer satisfaction; Trust","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84941101922"

After briefly reviewing recent contributions to the technology-oriented multi-level perspective (MLP) and to social scientific explanations of 'behavioural change', we outline a practice-based approach to understanding final consumption and sustainability. Practice-based approaches reveal processes of reproduction (stasis) and change in forms of consumption, which we argue present conceptual insights into sustainability transitions. By examining the tensions and crossovers between the MLP and practice-based approaches to consumption, three specific forms of interaction are identified for further conceptual and empirical exploration: the social relations of consumption; co-dependent changes in production and consumption; and, technologies, practices and consumption. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","final consumption; multi-level perspectives; sociotechnical systems; sustainability transitions; theories of practice","conceptual framework; consumption behavior; planning theory; sustainability; technological development; technology adoption; theoretical study","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84859573313"

In the online marketplace, one area of growing interest is that of product returns. Though commonly viewed as a cost center from an operations perspective, operations' actions have the potential to strongly influence future customer buying behavior in several ways. Using an archival database of actual purchase and returns history provided by a moderately sized online retailer, this study examines the relationship between a customer's experience of product returns, and subsequent shopping behavior. Employing transaction cost, consumer risk, and procedural justice theories, we demonstrate that the returns management process, rather than being regarded as an afterthought to the production and deployment of goods, can significantly and positively influence repurchase behavior. Additionally, we provide evidence that certain customers should be considered for prioritization in the returns process. We suggest ways through which operations managers can take care in discharging their responsibilities in this area - to make returns processing more than simply a ""necessary cost of doing business"" rather, using it to their advantage in engendering repeat and increased purchase behavior. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In particular, many customers use online carts for entertainment or as a shopping research and organizational tool, which may induce them to buy at a later session or via another channel. Our framework extends theories of online buyer and non-buyer behavior while revealing new inhibitors to buying in the Internet era.

Much research has focused on advancing recommendation technologies to improve accuracy of predictions, although behavioral aspects of using recommender systems are often overlooked. In our studies, we explore how consumer preferences at the time of consumption are impacted by predictions generated by recommender systems. We conducted three controlled laboratory experiments to explore the effects of system recommendations on preferences. Studies 1 and 2 investigated user preferences for television programs across a variety of conditions, which were surveyed immediately following program viewing. Study 3 investigated the granularity of the observed effects within individual participants. Results provide strong evidence that the rating presented by a recommender system serves as an anchor for the consumer's constructed preference. Viewers' preference ratings are malleable and can be significantly influenced by the recommendation received. The effect is sensitive to the perceived reliability of a recommender system and, thus, not a purely numerical or priming-based effect. Finally, the effect of anchoring is continuous and linear, operating over a range of perturbations of the system. These general findings have a number of important implications (e.g., on recommender systems performance metrics and design, preference bias, potential strategic behavior, and trust), which are discussed. © 2013, INFORMS.","Anchoring effects; Behavioral decision making; Behavioral economics; Electronic commerce; Experimental research; Preferences; Recommender systems","Behavioral research; Commerce; Decision making; Economics; Electronic commerce; Anchoring effects; Behavioral decision makings; Behavioral economics; Experimental research; Preferences; Recommender systems","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84891819871"

It also aims to identify factors affecting consumers' attitudes toward FIs. Design/methodology/approach: To achieve this goal, the authors propose a conceptual model that combines the theory of planned behavior (TPB) and theoretical outcomes of prior literature related to influencer marketing. Based on data collected from 610 Moroccan respondents, the authors empirically test the conceptual model using a partial least squares (PLS) estimation. Findings: This study illustrates that attitudes toward FIs positively impact brand attitude and consumer purchase intention. The authors also demonstrate that perceived credibility, trust, perceived behavioral control, perceived subjective norms, perceived expertise and perceived congruence positively impact attitudes toward FIs. Practical implications: The study findings help marketers and advertisers in the fashion industry to understand how influencer marketing contributes to consumer purchase intention. They also allow marketers to understand factors explaining attitudes toward FIs and therefore better select influencers capable of creating purchase intentions among existing and potential customers.

Guided by the stimulus-organism-response paradigm, it proposes a model for exploring the effects of external stimuli (perceived threat and perceived information overload) related to COVID-19 on consumers’ internal states (sadness, anxiety, and cognitive dissonance) and their subsequent behavioral intentions to avoid health information and engage in preventive behaviors. With a survey sample (N = 721), we empirically examined the proposed model and tested the hypotheses. The results indicate that sadness, anxiety, and cognitive dissonance, which were a result of perceived threat and perceived information overload, had heterogeneous effects on information avoidance. Anxiety and cognitive dissonance increased information avoidance intention, while sadness decreased information avoidance intention. Moreover, information avoidance predicted a reluctance on the part of consumers to engage in preventive behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings not only contribute to the information behavior literature and extend the concept of information avoidance to a public health emergency context, but also yield practical insights for global pandemic control. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Anxiety; Cognitive dissonance; Information avoidance; Information overload; Public health emergency; S-O-R model; Sadness","Health risks; Public health; Avoidance behavior; Behavioral intention; Cognitive dissonance; Health emergencies; Health informations; Heterogeneous effects; Information behavior; Information overloads; Consumer behavior","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85092095387"

This paper provides a specific take on these issues through an exploration of the contested geographies of contemporary commercial culture. Traditionally, 'culture' has been associated with meaning and creativity, with works of the imagination and aesthetic practices that are far removed from the pursuit of economic profit. By contrast, 'commerce' has conventionally been regarded with disdain by critically minded social scientist, signalling a vulgar and materialistic world, devoid of morality, where human agency is subordinated to the logic of capital. This paper aims to challenge such dualistic thinking by exploring the commodification of cultural difference and by demonstrating that the rational calculus of the market is inescapably embedded in a range of cultural practices. The argument moves from an analysis of linear commodity chains to an exploration of more complex circuits and networks, illustrated with examples from contemporary commodity culture, looking specifically at the food and fashion sectors. Rather than demonstrating complexity for its own sake, the objective is to identify new forms of understanding and new possibilities for intervention in what can sometimes seem like an all-encompassing 'consumer culture' where every act of resistance is immediately recuperated in successive rounds of commodification.","(cultural) difference; Commerce; Commodities; Culture; Fashion; Food","commercial activity; consumption behavior; cultural influence; market conditions","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0036072532"

There is growing evidence that some consumers choose not to engage with social media marketing content and that the depth of consumer engagement varies across different social media. However, there is a lack of empirical research on contextual factors that may contribute to such differences. Moreover, the variation of social media engagement behaviours, namely, consumption, contribution, and creation is underexplored. Hence, we seek to understand the various levels of engagement behaviours that are influenced by key social media contextual factors, namely media richness and content trustworthiness. We analyse 721 survey responses using PLS-SEM. Results reveal significant effects of media context on engagement behaviours.

Realizing that their interests are converging, the two sides are working together to create innovative business models that are helping to grow new markets and accelerate the eradication of poverty. The path to convergence has proceeded in three stages. In the initial be-responsible stage, companies and NGOs, realizing that they had to coexist, started to look for ways to influence each other through joint social responsibility projects. This experience paved the way for the get-into-business stage, in which NGOs and companies sought to serve the poor by setting up successful businesses. In the process, NGOs learned business discipline from the private sector, while corporations gained an appreciation for the local knowledge, low-cost business models, and community-based marketing techniques that the NGOs have mastered. Increased success on both sides has laid the foundation for the cocreate-business stage, in which companies and NGOs become key parts of each other's capacity to deliver value. When BP sought to market a duel-fuel portable stove in India, it set up one such cocreation system with three Indian NGOs. The system allowed BP to bring the innovative stove to a geographically dispersed market through myriad local distributors without incurring distribution costs so high that the product would become unaffordable. The company sold its stoves profitably, the NGOs gained access to a lucrative revenue stream that could fund other projects, and consumers got more than the ability to sit down to a hot meal - they got the opportunity to earn incomes as the local distributors and thus to gain economic and social influence.","","Administrative Personnel; Commerce; Humans; Models, Theoretical; Poverty; Social Responsibility; United States; administrative personnel; article; commercial phenomena; human; organization and management; poverty; social behavior; theoretical model; United States","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-33846679226"

In terms of preferences, Pioneers express extremely high valuation of PEVs and prefer pure battery electric vehicle (BEV) designs over plug-in hybrid electric (PHEV) designs. In contrast, Potential Early Mainstream respondents prefer PHEVs. Both Pioneer and Potential Early Mainstream respondents are similarly cautious about controlled charging programs, but Pioneers place five times as much value on using electricity generated from renewable sources than the Potential Early Mainstream.

Among the three types of needs identified to be satisfied through apparel (i.e. experiential, social and functional needs), experiential needs were the most important needs that influenced apparel purchases of female consumers in both Asian markets. Consumers in both country markets exhibited brand loyal behavior in apparel purchases, fulfilling all three needs. However, actualization patterns of each need through brand loyal behavior differed between the two consumer samples. While for brand-loyal Chinese consumers experiential image was the most important aspect of the branded apparel appeal to female consumers, social image with performance quality assurance was a more important feature of the branded apparel appeal to consumers in Korea.

People count on other users' opinions and information; they sometimes even make offline decisions based on information acquired online. The purpose of this paper is to conceptualise eWOM activity from an input-process-output (IPO) perspective; propose a classification framework based on the identified academic literature; analyze eWOM literature in terms of quantitative development and qualitative issues that are useful to both academics and researchers; and provide directions and guidelines for future research studies in eWOM. Design/methodology/approach: The authors performed a systematic literature review of peer-reviewed published journal articles and examined the current state of knowledge on eWOM literature based on a comprehensive search of several leading databases. In total, 94 articles were identified that comprised contributions from different strands of eWOM research. The scope of this investigation was limited to the timeframe of 2000-2009. Findings: The present study finds that research in eWOM is relatively new and has evolved only during the last ten years. This ten-year study is deemed to be representative of the available eWOM literature. It is also shown that many scholars have incorporated established theories to explain eWOM communication phenomena. The current study not only fills the current gap in eWOM research but also provides a roadmap in analyzing eWOM communications. Practical implications: This study serves as a consolidated database that may be used to guide future research. It provides a structured approach to analyzing the literature and identifying trends and gaps in order to map out an appropriate agenda for eWOM research. The proposed integrated classification framework can serve as a roadmap for academic research. Originality/value: This paper systematically reviews the current state of eWOM research. To contribute to the development of a more comprehensive database for eWOM research, a classification framework of the eWOM literature is presented, building on the IPO model, by summarizing and organizing prior research into three areas covering antecedents, processes, and consequences of eWOM. The authors further summarize the theories and models that previous scholars have applied to their studies. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Classification; Consumer behaviour; Electronic commerce; Non-verbal communications","","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-79961158071"

For example, women at peak fertility (near ovulation) are attracted to different kinds of men and show increased desire to attend social gatherings. Building on the evolutionary logic behind such effects, we examined how, why, and when hormonal fluctuations associated with ovulation influenced women's product choices. In three experiments, we show that at peak fertility women nonconsciously choose products that enhance appearance (e.g., choosing sexy rather than more conservative clothing). This hormonally regulated effect appears to be driven by a desire to outdo attractive rival women. Consequently, minimizing the salience of attractive women who are potential rivals suppresses the ovulatory effect on product choice.

Both correlational and causal evidence is provided in a series of five studies that examine country-level power distance as well as individual and temporarily salient power distance belief.

The existence of habits - not fully conscious forms of behaviour - is important as it contradicts rational choice theory. Their presence thus calls for the setting of new instruments as they make it unlikely that consumers be capable of exercising control over their energy consumption in reaction to given incentives. This is further increased in the evolutionary perspective where the current carbon-based Socio-Technical System constrains and shapes consumers' choices through structural forces. Habits being potentially ""counterintentional,"" they may explain the ""efficiency paradox"" in energy as well as the continued increase of energy consumption despite the rising environmental awareness among the population. Policies aiming at reducing energy consumption should thus specifically address the performance context of habits. For instance, targeting new residents has proven to be more effective given that their preceding habits have been disturbed. The results of our empirical analysis confirm this idea by showing how a change of context makes people more receptive to a proposed measure. Our analysis of the role played by habits also suggests that individuals do not consider the need to change existing habits as an obstacle even though this is contradicted implicitly in the answers they provided to open questions. This ""unconsciousness"" is one of the most delicate features of habits and it should thus be accounted for when designing measures. Given the other characteristics of habits, the joint use of feedbacks and commitment strategies appears promising. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

This is typically done by expanding the tangible product or by adding augmentations. These expansions and augmentations provide useful bases for event promotions if the nature of benefits derived and the segments to whom those benefits appeal are identified. The key to identifying benefits and segments is to examine customers' relationships to the subculture of the sport being showcased. Recent research suggests that consumers' enjoyment of sport events derives, at least in part, from their identification with the sport's subculture. This is consistent with other work in consumer behaviour demonstrating the importance of subculture in transmitting consumption values, particularly in leisure contexts. Recent research into three events - the Key West Women's Flag Football Tournament, the Gold Coast Marathon, and the Australian Motorcycle Grand Prix - highlights the utility of leveraging event consumers' identification with the sport's subculture when promoting sport events. Implications and recommendations for event management and marketing are reviewed. © 2001 Sport Management Association of Australia and New Zealand.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0041812476"

The aim of our research was to identify the characteristics of plant-based nutrition, based on international and Hungarian literature. The comprehensive analysis was performed based on the theoretical model called Theory of Planned Behavior, in the course of which the perceived and objective benefits of and barriers to the conversion to a plant-based diet were examined. According to our results, the main benefits of plant-based nutrition are its many factors associated with a reduction in risk of developing numerous chronic diseases. This is followed by benefits of well-being and satisfaction, followed by ethical and environmental benefits. The most commonly reported inhibitory factor of a vegetarian diet is the enjoyment of eating meat and the difficulty in giving up meat consumption. This is followed by health considerations, e.g., lack of various ingredients in foods. Convenience and taste factors are also important disincentives, as well as the irrelevant nature of some plant-based nutrition information sources. Besides, social barriers, negative discrimination, and negative effect on mental health associated with them can also be a hindrance, as can financial barriers. The classification developed during our analysis can serve as a relevant guideline for decision-makers, and also as a basis for further primary qualitative and quantitative research. © 2020 by the authors.","Benefits and barriers; Comprehensive review; Consumer attitudes; International and Hungarian; Objective; Perceived; Plant-based diet; Theory of planned behavior; Vegan; Vegetarian","Hungary; diet; disease spread; food consumption; food industry; health risk; literature review; mental health; planning theory; research work","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85085599399"

Logistic regression was used to examine whether health information seekers turning to the Internet first differed in terms of demographics, information preferences and seeking confidence, and communication with providers from those using other sources. In the final model, Internet users were younger, more educated, higher income, preferred numbers rather than words to describe chance, and think it is very important to get personal medical information electronically. There were no differences in terms of gender, health status, confidence seeking health information, or communication with providers. Health information seekers who turn to the Internet first are different, both in terms of demographics and information preferences. As the use of communication technologies increases, health communicators need to be attentive to the potential for communication inequalities.

This paper also clarifies how the remanufacturing process should be communicated and circular fashion marketed to consumers. Design/methodology/approach: The research methodology consisted of consumer interviews, utilising an online innovation platform (Owela) to involve consumers and workshops with project partners and with external stakeholders. Findings: Consumers’ interest towards recycling and sustainable solutions has increased. They appreciate the idea of recycling textile waste to produce new clothes; circular products should become “the new normal”. Consumers are asking for more visible and concrete information about circular clothing and how their behaviour has affected the environmental aspects of textile production. The communication should be timed correctly by using multiple communication channels and also paying attention to the shopping experience. In addition, digital services alongside circular clothing could create additional value for consumers. Research limitations/implications: In this study, only consumers from Finland were involved. The results might be different in different parts of Europe and especially worldwide. Originality/value: This study focusses on circular clothing – an area that has not been studied much before. Also, consumers involved in this study were of a different age compared to most of the previous studies, where the focus has been mainly on young college students. © 2018, Kaisa Vehmas, Anne Raudaskoski, Pirjo Heikkilä, Ali Harlin and Aino Mensonen.","Circular clothing; Circular economy; Co-creation; Communication; Consumers; Relooping fashion","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85046731911"

This study extends the understanding of green consumer behaviour by testing an integrated conceptual model that explores the influence of personal concern, other pro-environmental behaviours, greenwashing beliefs, consumer innovativeness, and personal predisposition to seeking information on the purchasing of circular packaging. We explored both the stand-alone and the mediating effects of information seeking. Data were collected from a questionnaire-based survey administered to a large and representative sample of Italian families, using 1,643 valid responses. We used structural equation modelling to test the proposed hypotheses. The results highlight the fundamental importance of seeking information in order to guide consumption choices that are more consistent with the circular economy. For managers, our paper suggests that packaging counts in purchasing decisions and that information is used by consumers to search for consistency between personal attitudes, other pro-environmental behaviours, and the circular attributes of packaging. © 2020 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","circular economy; environmental information; environmental policy; green consumer behaviour; packaging; sustainable consumption","Italy; consumption behavior; environmental economics; environmental policy; information management; sustainability; sustainable development","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85087553326"

Study 2 examined age trends in musical preferences. Results indicated that (a) musical preferences can be conceptualized in terms of a 5-dimensional age-invariant model, (b) certain music-preference dimensions decrease with age (e.g., Intense, Contemporary), whereas preferences for other music dimensions increase with age (e.g., Unpretentious, Sophisticated), and (c) age trends in musical preferences are closely associated with personality.

The purpose of the paper is to examine how consumer engagement is shaped via AR apps, which eventually leads to a positive attitude towards brand and brand usage intent. To this end, a face-to-face survey instrument was administered to 350 participants in Turkey, where participants tried an AR app and then answered a questionnaire. The structural equation modeling (SEM) and Hayes' Process analyses were applied to test the hypotheses and moderated mediation relationships. Findings showed that interactivity and inspiration are two major antecedents of consumers' flow experience. The flow experience with AR can generate favorable attitudes towards AR apps and more trust in AR apps, which trigger consumer engagement with AR apps and then improve brand attitude and brand usage intent. The outcomes of flow experience with AR (i.e., attitude and trust) mediate the relationship between flow and engagement. Although perceived usefulness increases the effect of consumers' attitudes towards AR on engagement, it has no moderating effect on the relationship between trust in AR and engagement. Furthermore, the results of Hayes' Process revealed that the indirect effect of flow on consumers’ engagement with AR through attitude towards AR is moderated by perceived usefulness. So that, if AR marketers aim to strengthen the link between consumer flow experience and engagement via attitudes towards AR, they should therefore consider enhancing the perceived usefulness of AR. Surprisingly, perceived usefulness had no moderating effect on the indirect relationship between flow and engagement via trust. Finally, this paper discusses both the theoretical and managerial implications. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Augmented reality marketing; Brand outcomes; Consumers engagement; Flow; Inspiration; Interactivity","Turkey; Meleagris gallopavo; consumer-resource interaction; consumption behavior; marketing; retailing; software","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85114666047"

Although evidence of the effect of these two influences is abundant at the market level, there is a paucity of research documenting the simultaneous effect of both influences at the individual consumer level. Thus, the primary objective of this paper is to fill the gap in the literature by documenting the existence and magnitude of both influences at the individual customer level while controlling for unobserved temporal effects. The pharmaceutical industry provides an appropriate context to study this problem. It has been conjectured that adoption and usage patterns of a new drug by physicians - ""contagion"" - acts as a ""consumption externality,"" as it allows a given physician to learn about the efficacy and use of the drug. In addition, pharmaceutical companies target individual physicians via marketing activities such as detailing, sampling, and direct-to-consumer advertising. Our data contain the launch of a new drug from an important drug category. We chose two unrelated markets (Manhattan and Indianapolis) for our empirical analysis. We model an individual physician's decision to adopt a new drug in a given time period as a binary choice decision. This decision is modeled as a function of temporal trends (linear and quadratic) and individual physician-level contagion and marketing activity (both individual level and market level). Our contagion measure aggregates the adoption behavior of geographically near physicians for each physician in our sample. Our results from the Manhattan market indicate that both targeted communication and contagion have an effect on the individual physician's adoption decision. A major challenge is to rule out alternative explanations for the detected contagion effect. We therefore carry out a series of tests and show that this effect persists even after we control for the effects of time, individual salespeople, other marketing instruments, local market effects, and the effects of some institutional factors. We believe that our contagion effect arises because the consumption externality is stronger for geographically close physicians. We discuss some underlying processes that are probably giving rise to the contagion effect we detected. Finally, we compute the social multiplier of marketing and find it to be about 11%. We also use the estimated parameters to compare the relative effect of contagion and targeted marketing. We find that marketing plays a large (relative) role in affecting early adoption. However, the role of contagion dominates from month 4 onward and, by month 17 (or about half the duration of our data), asymptotes to about 90% of the effect. © 2008 INFORMS.","Contagion; Hierarchical bayesian methods; New product adoption; Pharmaceutical industry; Social interactions; Social networks; Word of mouth","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-58149255144"

This model is intended to bridge the gap between the objective quality approach pursued in food sciences, the product characteristics approach, and the subjectively perceived quality approach, the product attribute approach as pursued in the consumer behaviour literature. The focus is on the information processing by the consumer. Information on the product quality is supplied to the consumer in the form of cues received while shopping or consuming. A distinction is made between extrinsic and intrinsic cues, and between search, experience, and credencequality attributes. Within the credence attributes, three categories are distinguished: food safety, health, and all other credence quality attributes. It is demonstrated that public policy should use minimum standards for regulating food safety, information and consumer education on health issues and definitional standards to regulate the other credence qualities. In the case of search quality, no public intervention is needed. In the case of experience quality, reputation is a means of reducing the quality erosion inherent for experience quality attributes. In the case of those foods which are not sold prepacked over the counter, these means are restricted. Here the public regulators could consider backing up the private quality policy efforts on labelling by implementing traceability schemes and defining the requirements for specific label claims. © 2000, MCB UP Limited","Fastfood restaurants; Product mix","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84986106087"

The purpose of this paper is to examine the state of sustainable luxury research in marketing and consumer behaviour by critically reviewing and synthesizing the growing but fragmented body of scholarly work on sustainable-luxury marketing. The paper critically assesses where, how and by whom research on sustainable luxury is being conducted, and it identifies gaps for future investigation. The paper reviews research published between 2007 and 2018 within major peer-reviewed English-language scholarly publications in business, marketing, ethics, fashion, food and tourism journals. The research is identified using the keywords sustainable luxury, green luxury, eco-luxury and organic luxury. Three core themes emerge from this review: (1) consumer concerns and practices; (2) organizational concerns and practices; and (3) international and cross-cultural issues. The review confirms that research on sustainable luxury is significantly underdeveloped. This paper provides the first critical and comprehensive assessment and categorization of the emergent literature streams on sustainable luxury. The authors argue for a broader, deeper and more critical research agenda on the relationship between sustainability and luxury. Potential avenues for future research on sustainable luxury are proposed, with calls for theoretical and cross-cultural reflections that tackle broader systemic and institutional issues within the field. © 2019 The Authors.

Previous market structure models have adopted a static framework (e.g., Elrod 1988, Chintagunta 1994, Elrod and Keane 1995). Furthermore, they assumed that consumer perceptions of brand attributes do not vary across consumers. Yet, these approaches may render inaccurate representations of market structure if there is state dependence in consumer choice behavior. This paper attempts to incorporate consumer choice dynamics into market structure models by specifying the source of choice dynamics explicitly. In particular, the process by which past purchases affect current choices is modeled in a framework which captures both consumer habit persistence and variety seeking behavior. More specifically, consumer preferences brand attributes are modeled to depend on the attributes of brands bought on the previous purchase occasion. Furthermore, the modeling approach adopted incorporates heterogeneity in both consumer preferences and perceptions of brand attributes. The audience of this paper includes practitioners and academics interested in understanding consumer choice processes and inferring market structure from consumer choice data. The proposed models are estimated on Nielsen scanner panel data for margarine, peanut butter, yogurt, and liquid detergent using simulated maximum likelihood techniques. The empirical results suggest that accounting for choice dynamics improves both in-sample and out-of-sample fit. The results indicate that the average consumer is habit persistent in all the product categories studied. This result is consistent with the findings of Kannan and Sanchez (1994), who conducted an aggregate analysis of consumer variety seeking behavior across product categories. However, the results obtained in this paper suggest that consumers are heterogeneous with respect to the processes by which past purchases affect current purchases. These results provide strong evidence for habit persistence and variety seeking in brand attributes to be the behavioral source of consumer choice dynamics in food categories. Thus, consumer tastes (utility weights) seem to be affected by the attributes of the brands consumed in the past. Given the empirical result that a large proportion of consumers are habit persistent, tte suggests that tastes are reinforced by the brand attributes consumed in the past. The empirical results also show that not accounting for state dependence in market structure models for panel data may produce misleading results, hat is, depending on consumer behavior patterns, models that do not account for state dependence may distort the true nature of competition among brands. More specially, the results confirm the expectation that if there is habit persistence, that is, if consumer tastes are reinforced by attributes of brands consumed in the past, models that do not capture this choice dynamics will overestimate the distance between (similar) brands. Furthermore, the policy experiments conducted suggest that (1) static models overestimate the short-run impact of a price cut on the sales of the brand on promotion, (2) price cuts hurt the sales of the more similar brands more, and (3) free samples affect relatively less similar brands the most. Finally this paper studies variety seeking and habit persistence across brands over purchase occasions. However, variety seeking behavior may also involve the purchase of a portfolio of brands or items at a purchase occasion. Consumers may buy multiple items knowing that prior to the next trip they may want to consume different items (Simanson 1990, Walsh 1995). This type of behavior can be modeled within the context of dynamic expected utility maximization with forward-looking consumers. The development and estimation of market structure models that include forward-looking consumers who maximize expected-utility over a planning horizon, incorporating their future tastes and needs, and shopping for an inventory of brands, remain an important future research issue.","Brand choice; Buyer behavior; Econometric models; Market structure","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0030299445"

However, attempts to quantify the factors contributingtowards relationship quality have been held back by the complexity ofthe underlying factors and their interrelatedness. Traditionalregression techniques are not effective in analysing data with highlevels of multi‐collinearity and missing information, typical in manystudies of buyer behaviour. Makes use of a relatively new technique– neural network analysis – to try to quantify the factors contributing tobuyer‐seller relationship quality. The technique uses astatistically‐based learning procedure modelled on the workings of thehuman brain which quantifies the relationship between input and outputvariables through an intermediate “hidden” variable level analogous to thebrain. For this study, a neural network was developed with two outcomecomponents of relationship quality (relationship satisfaction andtrust), and five input antecedents (the salesperson′s sales orientation,customer orientation, expertise, ethics and the relationship′sduration). In a comparison of multiple regression and neural networktechniques, the latter was found to give statistically more significantoutcomes.

Of note, the gesture appeared to enhance the effectiveness of the ad. The authors tested whether neurophysiological measures can capture differences in consumer reactions to slightly different marketing stimuli. Indeed, by using electroencephalography and electromyography and by monitoring skin conductance, the authors were able to register significant differences in neurophysiological reactions to an altered scene, even though the difference was not consciously seen.

We use the reflexive layers of influence conceptual framework to categorize social influence according to three processes: diffusion, the sharing of BEV-related information; translation, the discussion of uncertain BEV benefits and drawbacks; and reflexivity, the relating of BEV technology to self-concept.

Some scholars attempt to explain the limited efficacy of control policies by focusing on domestic interest groups, political institutions, and the interaction among them; others approach the issue from an international or ""intermestic"" perspective. Despite the modest effects of control measures on unauthorized flows of economic migrants and asylum seekers, governments continue to determine the proportion of migrants who enjoy legal status, the specific membership rights associated with different legal (and undocumented) migrant classes, and how policies are implemented. These choices have important implications for how the costs and benefits of migration are distributed among different groups of migrants, native-born workers, employers, consumers, and taxpayers.

This study presents results of an investigation of consumer awareness, willingness to pay, and price premiums for milk products manufactured using Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) management, a quality management system used to reduce food safety risks. Chinese food processors initially sought HACCP certification to access export markets, but now HACCP is rapidly being adopted for domestic products and HACCP logos have begun to appear on labels in China. A survey of Beijing consumers found that less than one in five respondents was aware of HACCP, and most who had heard of HACCP had learned about it within the previous year. After receiving information on HACCP nearly all respondents were willing to pay a modest price premium for HACCP-certified products. Products with HACCP labels in Beijing supermarkets sold at a price premium of about 5% over products without such labels, holding other product attributes constant. The results indicate that demand for food safety is emerging as an attribute demanded by Chinese consumers. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

There are multiple causes of suboptimal breastfeeding, including marketing of breast-milk substitutes. Objectives: To describe sales and marketing of breast-milk substitutes and their influence on World Health Organization-recommended breastfeeding behaviors, focusing on low- andmiddle-income countries. Methods: Literature review. Results: Global sales of breast-milk substitutes reached US$40 billion in 2013. Growth in sales exceeds 10% annually in many low- and middle-income countries, while it is close to stagnant in high-income countries. Breast-milk substitutes are marketed directly to consumers via mass media and print advertisements and indirectly via incentives, free supplies, and promotions to and through health workers and facilities, retailers, and policy makers. Internet marketing via company web sites and social media is on the rise. Marketing influences social norms by making formula use seem to be extensive, modern, and comparable to or better than breast milk. Clear evidence of a negative impact is found when breast-milk substitutes are provided for free in maternity facilities and when they are promoted by health workers and in the media. Influences through other channels are plausible, but rigorous studies are lacking. It was not possible with the data available to quantify the impact of marketing relative to other factors on suboptimal breastfeeding behaviors. Marketing remains widespread even in countries that have adopted the International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes to restrict such activities. Conclusion: Adoption of stricter regulatory frameworks coupled with independent, quantitative monitoring and compliance enforcement are needed to counter the impacts of formula marketing globally. © The Author(s) 2015.","Breastfeeding; Infant and young child feeding (IYCF); Nutrition policy; Southeast Asia; Sub-Saharan Africa","Breast Feeding; Direct-to-Consumer Advertising; Health Impact Assessment; Health Promotion; Humans; Income; Infant; Infant Formula; Infant Mortality; Infant Nutritional Physiological Phenomena; Infant, Newborn; Mass Media; Milk Substitutes; Milk, Human; Nutrition Policy; Poverty; World Health Organization; Southeast Asia; Sub-Saharan Africa; breastfeeding; incentive; literature review; marketing; mass media; mortality; nutrition; nutritional status; social media; socioeconomic conditions; World Health Organization; adoption; advertising; Africa south of the Sahara; behavior; breast feeding; breast milk; consumer; health care personnel; high income country; human; human experiment; Internet; marketing; mass medium; middle income country; milk substitute; monitoring; nutrition policy; quantitative study; social media; social norm; Southeast Asia; artificial milk; breast feeding; direct-to-consumer advertizing; health care policy; health impact assessment; health promotion; income; infant; infant mortality; infant nutrition; newborn; poverty; procedures; world health organization","Review","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84986564715"

We estimate the model using a rich data set obtained from IdeaStorm.com, a crowdsourced ideation initiative affiliated with Dell. We find that, on IdeaStorm.com, individuals tend to significantly underestimate the costs to the firm for implementing their ideas but overestimate the potential of their ideas in the initial stages of the crowdsourcing process. Therefore, the ""idea market"" is initially overcrowded with ideas that are less likely to be implemented. However, individuals learn about both their abilities to come up with high-potential ideas as well as the cost structure of the firm from peer voting on their ideas and the firm's response to contributed ideas. We find that individuals learn rather quickly about their abilities to come up with high-potential ideas, but the learning regarding the firm's cost structure is quite slow. Contributors of low-potential ideas eventually become inactive, whereas the high-potential idea contributors remain active. As a result, over time, the average potential of generated ideas increases while the number of ideas contributed decreases. Hence, the decrease in the number of ideas generated represents market efficiency through self-selection rather than its failure. Through counterfactuals, we show that providing more precise cost signals to individuals can accelerate the filtering process. Increasing the total number of ideas to respond to and improving the response speed will lead to more idea contributions. However, failure to distinguish between high- and low-potential ideas and between high- and low-ability idea generators leads to the overall potential of the ideas generated to drop significantly. ©2014 INFORMS.","Crowdsourcing; Dynamic learning; Econometric analyses; Heterogeneity; Structural modeling; Utility","Commerce; Dynamic learning; Econometric analysis; Heterogeneity; Structural modeling; Utility; Crowdsourcing","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84907382608"

A parsimonious theoretical model was defined and tested with data collected from 215 web-shopping episodes during which consumers were shopping for low-touch products. Analysis of the results showed that web site quality had a positive impact on the cognitive appraisal of situational state, which in turn influenced five of the six emotions of the proposed model: liking, joy, pride, dislike, and frustration. Results also showed that a substantial number of shoppers experienced intensively the emotions of liking and joy.

Data were collected from 639 customers currently using offline investment banking. Results show that offline channel satisfaction reduces the perceived usefulness and enhances the perceived risk of the online channel. These inhibiting effects represent a status quo bias. Trust in the bank shows both adoption-enhancing effects and an adoption-inhibiting effect. Finally, the negative relationship between offline channel satisfaction and perceived usefulness is significantly stronger for men, older people, and less experienced Internet users.

Much of the research in the literature today attempts to recommend products that have a high probability of purchase (conditional on the customer's history). However, the author posits that the recommendation decision should be based not on purchase probabilities but rather on the sensitivity of purchase probabilities to the recommendation action. This article attempts to model carefully the role of firms' recommendation actions in modifying customers' buying behaviors relative to what the customers would do without such a recommendation intervention. The author proposes a simple consumer behavior model that accommodates a transparent role for a firm's recommendation actions. The model is expressed in econometric terms so that it can be estimated with available data. The author studies these ideas using purchase data from a real e-commerce firm and compares the performance of the proposed main model with the performance of benchmark models. The author shows that the main model is better than benchmark models on key measures. © 2008 American Marketing Association.","automatic recommendation systems; cross-selling; customer relationship management; direct marketing; dual latent class models; hierarchical Bayes models; Internet marketing; one-to-one marketing; stochastic choice models; up-selling","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-38849148708"

However, research on the antecedents of brand love is sparse. The current research draws on the information processing model as well as on the experiential approaches to consumer behaviour to develop a model comprising a novel set of antecedents. Design/methodology/approach: To test the research hypotheses, we resort to two samples, which implied the collection of usable 1,018 questionnaires. For hypotheses testing, we resort to structural equation modelling. Findings: Both functional constructs as well as more symbolic/emotional ones are positively associated with brand love. In addition, constructs with a more functional nature tend to have an indirect effect on brand love, whereas constructs with a higher level of abstraction tend to mediate the effects of more specific brand qualities. Finally, brand love is related with important outcomes, including loyalty, word of mouth and willingness to pay a premium price. Research/limitations implications: This research has a cross-sectional nature. Moreover, we rely on a single informant, but the procedural remedies as well as the statistical tests we conducted suggest that common method variance is not a concern. Practical implications: The findings suggest that managers should emphasise both functional as well as emotional/symbolic aspects to strengthen the links between brands and consumers, which will be beneficial for both sides. Originality/value: This study is the first to investigate the relationship between a number of symbolic and functional brand aspects and the development of brand love feelings. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Brand loyalty; Brand management; Branding","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85043454554"

As a result of the numerous variables involved, most of the studies that have compared the carbon footprints of online and conventional retailing only take a partial view. To make a more holistic assessment, this study develops a framework that accounts for all the relevant environmental factors relating to retail/e-commerce activities. Variables related to consumer shopping behaviour such as basket size, transport mode, trip length and trip frequency are included in the analysis. This framework is used to build a Life Cycle Analysis model. The model is applied to different online retail methods for fast-moving consumer goods in the United Kingdom. We find that, within the ""last mile"" link to the home, the nature of the consumer's behaviour in terms of travel, choice of e-fulfilment method and basket size are critical factors in determining the environmental sustainability of e-commerce. The nature and routing of van deliveries, the amount and type of packaging used, and the energy efficiency of shop and e-fulfilment centre operations are also identified as significant contributors to climate change potential. The results of this study indicate ways in which e-commerce can be made more environmentally sustainable, encouraging consumers to reduce complementary shopping trips and maximise the number of items per delivery. This study identifies the strengths and weaknesses of a range of e-retail channels and provides a basis for future research on the environmental sustainability of online retailing of fast-moving consumer goods. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Instead, consumers tend to be drawn to shopping's more private pleasures, particularly the enjoyment of bargain hunting. The findings suggest that bargain hunting, rather than being antithetical to shopping enjoyment, may be one of its most common sources. In addition, the data suggest that the sources of shopping enjoyment vary markedly among different demographic groups.

Our findings show that the differential sensitivity of East Asian and American consumers to situational constraints influence their attributions for service failures, and thus moderate their satisfaction with service recovery process. More specifically, the results suggest that a causal explanation for service failure decreases the likelihood of US consumers falling prey to the fundamental attribution error.

The contrast between tap water and bottled water can be seen as a reflection of a contest for authority and public trust between governments and corporations, in a context of heightened anxieties about risk and health.

The authors return to the original meaning of cosmopolitanism as presented (independently) by Merton and Gouldner in the late 1950s, examining the concept in light of subsequent research and the social forces that have tended to promote an increasingly cosmopolitan perspective.

The cost and scale of returns management issues necessitate a deeper understanding of how to deal with product returns. We develop an analytical model that describes how consumer purchase and return decisions are affected by a seller's pricing and restocking fee policy. Taking into account the consumers' strategic behavior, we derive the seller's optimal policy as a function of consumer preferences, consumer uncertainty about product attributes, consumer hassle cost for returns, and the effectiveness of the seller's forward and reverse channel capability. We allow for two sources of consumer uncertainty and show how the seller may use its price and restocking fee as a means of targeting a segment of consumers who know their product consumption utilities. We find that even if it is possible to eliminate returns costlessly through the provision of information about the fit between consumer preferences and product characteristics, returns can nevertheless be part of an optimal product sales process. That is, we identify conditions under which it is (or is not) optimal to provide product fit information to consumers. We show that the marginal value of information to the seller is decreasing in the operational efficiency of the seller's forward and reverse logistics process as well as the level of product uncertainty. We identify the impact of multiple product options and sources of consumer uncertainty on the model's results. The analysis generates testable hypotheses about how consumer-level and seller-level parameters affect the return policies observed in the marketplace. © 2009 INFORMS.","Demand management; OM-marketing interface; Product returns; Restocking fees; Reverse logistics","Competition; Logistics; Marketing; Optimization; Purchasing; Demand management; OM-marketing interface; Product returns; Restocking fees; Reverse logistics; Costs","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-67449144979"

The research presented here is the first to look at voluntary simplicity with the use of a nationwide sample of American consumers. A more refined application of Maslow's theory of human motivation to the understanding of this social phenomenon is proposed. The practices considered most important to this lifestyle are identified, as are key impediments to its consistent practice. Factor analysis is used to identify the underlying dimensions of U.S. voluntary simplicity: ecological and social responsibility; community; and maintaining a spiritual life. Findings indicate that people of moderate income are more likely to practice voluntary simplicity than was previously believed.

The definition of moral hazard is broadened to include all parties in the insurance relationship, not just the insured. Moral hazards embedded in the social organization of private insurance lead to various kinds of immoral risky behaviour by insureds, insurance companies, and their employees, and to intensified efforts to regulate this behaviour. The analysis concludes with some critical observations about the neo-liberal emphasis on minimal state, market fundamentalism, risk-taking, individual responsibility, and acceptance of inequality.","Governance; Insurance; Insurance fraud; Moral hazard; Risk; neo-liberalism","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0007320434"

In turn, the associations of site atmospherics on site attitudes, site involvement, service attitudes, and purchase intentions are investigated. The model is compared between Canadian and Chinese customers based on Hofstede's (1991) cultural value dimensions. The findings supported the model and revealed several non-invariant paths between the groups. Particularly, the impact of pleasure (dominance) on the other behavioral variables was higher for Canadian (Chinese) compared to Chinese (Canadian) customers. Moreover, the impacts of low (high) task relevant cues were stronger for Chinese (Canadian) customers compared to their Canadian (Chinese) counterparts.

Design/methodology/approach – The study takes place in the Tunisian context. Even though Tunisia is a Muslim country, the culture is considerably different from those of the Middle East or Malaysia (countries where the majority of studies on Islamic banks have taken place). Consequently, an adapted religiosity scale was developed to fit the study’s context. Then, the scale was pre-tested on a sample of 188 respondents. In order to test the research hypotheses, a second data collection, based on a convenience sampling technique, was undertaken, yielding a sample of 217 respondents. Findings – The religiosity variable was found to be tridimensional. Results show that the more a person fears divine punishment, the more he/she will develop a favorable attitude towards Islamic banks. Also, the more a person believes in Islamic laws, the more favorable his/her attitude towards Islamic banks. However, the relationship between religious involvement (practice and interest) and attitude toward Islamic banks is found to be insignificant. Other alternative models were tested and the results indicate that neither fear, nor beliefs, nor religious involvement has a direct effect on purchase intention. Thus, religiosity has an indirect effect on purchase intentions of Islamic bank services through attitude towards these banks. Practical implications – It is suggested that a communication strategy focusing on the compatibility of Islamic banks with Islamic beliefs and eliminating any doubt that Islamic bank operations are suspicious (from a religious point of view) could attract a segment of consumers who wish to be in harmony with the prescriptions of their religion. Islamic banks can better position their offers compared to conventional banks and improve the perception of actual or potential clients. The study offers some implications to managers of conventional banks as well. Originality/value – Previous studies have reported the strong impact of religion on Muslims’ attitude towards Islamic banks. The main contribution of this study is to show which dimension of religiosity has the most important impact on attitude and purchase intention toward Islamic banks. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Banking; Consumer attitudes; Consumer behaviour","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84958524039"

The addition of menthol to cigarettes reduces perceived harshness of smoke, which can facilitate initiation. Here, we examine correlates of menthol use, national trends in smoking menthol and non-menthol cigarettes, and brand preferences over time.; Methods: We estimated menthol cigarette use during 2004–2010 using annual data on persons ≥12 years old from the National Surveys on Drug Use and Health. We adjusted self-reported menthol status for selected brands that were either exclusively menthol or nonmenthol, based on sales data. Data were weighted to provide national estimates.; Results: Among cigarette smokers, menthol cigarette use was more common among 12–17 year olds (56.7%) and 18–25 year olds (45.0%) than among older persons (range 30.5% to 34.7%). In a multivariable analysis, menthol use was associated with being younger, female and of non-Caucasian race/ethnicity. Among all adolescents, the percentage who smoked non-menthol cigarettes decreased from 2004–2010, while menthol smoking rates remained constant; among all young adults, the percentage who smoked non-menthol cigarettes also declined, while menthol smoking rates increased. The use of Camel menthol and Marlboro menthol increased among adolescent and young adult smokers, particularly non-Hispanic Caucasians, during the study period.; Conclusions: Young people are heavy consumers of mentholated cigarettes. Progress in reducing youth smoking has likely been attenuated by the sale and marketing of mentholated cigarettes, including emerging varieties of established youth brands. This study should inform the Food and Drug Administration regarding the potential public health impact of a menthol ban. © 2015, BMJ Publishing Group.

In this study, we attempt to investigate the moderating effect of inconsistent reviews (i.e., a mix of positive and negative reviews) on consumers' purchase decision. We further examine whether the effect will differ from female to male consumers. We explain the moderating effect and its gender differences based on the theory of reasoned action, trust literature, and information processing literature. The research hypotheses are empirically tested in a laboratory experiment using structural equation modeling approach. Our findings show that consumers' cognitive trust to online retailers affects emotional trust, which further leads to purchase intention. When consumers are exposed to inconsistent reviews, the influence of emotional trust on purchase intention is significantly stronger. Moreover, the moderating effect of inconsistent reviews is stronger for female consumers than for male consumers. We expect that this study can enrich the understanding of how inconsistent reviews play a role in consumers' online shopping decision.

This research uses an experimental approach to examine the empirical relationship between consumers' inferences of autonomy and perceived coolness. Six studies find that behaviors expressing autonomy increase perceived coolness, but only when the autonomy seems appropriate. Autonomy seems appropriate, and hence increases perceptions of coolness, when a behavior diverges from a norm considered unnecessary or illegitimate, when the autonomy is bounded (i.e., deviations are small or occasional rather than large or perpetual), and when the consumer views social norms as being overly repressive. A final experiment further supports the connection between autonomy and coolness and illustrates that coolness is distinct from liking by showing that whether a consumer has a goal to express autonomy moderates preference for cool brands. © 2014 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84904178033"

The authors focus on these out-of-store drivers and, unlike prior research, use panel data to ""hold the shopper constant"" while estimating unbiased trip-level effects. Thus, they uncover opportunities for retailers to generate more unplanned buying from existing shoppers. The authors find that the amount of unplanned buying increases monotonically with the abstractness of the overall shopping trip goal that is established before the shopper enters the store. Storelinked goals also affect unplanned buying; unplanned buying is higher on trips in which the shopper chooses the store for favorable pricing and lower on trips in which the shopper chooses the store as part of a multistore shopping trip. Although out-of-store marketing has no direct effect, it reinforces the lift in unplanned buying from shoppers who use marketing materials inside the store.

The study seeks to address concerns about the experiential aspects of mobile commerce regardless of the consumption type. For the purpose, the authors aims to propose a stimulus-organism-response (S-O-R) based model that incorporates both utilitarian and hedonic factors of consumers. A survey study was conducted to collect data from 293 mobile phone users. The questionnaire was administered in study classrooms, a library, or via e-mail. The measurement model and structural model were examined using LISREL 8.7. The results of this research implied that emotion played a significant role in the mobile consumption experience; hedonic factors had a positive effect on the consumption experience, while utilitarian factors had a negative effect on the consumption experience of consumers. The empirical findings also indicated that media richness was as important as subjective norms, and more important than convenience and self-efficacy. Few m-commerce studies have focused directly on the experiential aspects of consumption, including the hedonic experience and positive emotions among mobile device users. Applying the stimulus-organism-response (S-O-R) framework from the perspective of the experiential view, the current research model is developed to examine several utilitarian and hedonic factors in the context of the consumption experience, and indicates a comparison between the information processing (utilitarian) view and the experiential (hedonic) view of consumer behavior. It illustrates the relationships among six variables (i.e. convenience, media richness, subjective norms, self-efficacy, emotion, and consumption experience) in a mobile commerce context. © 2012, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Consumer behaviour; Consumer behaviour; Consumption experience; Electronic commerce; Emotion; Experiential view; Mobile commerce; Mobile technology; Stimulus-organism-response (S-O-R)","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84863388533"

Instead of being treated as a binary attribute, three levels of USDA organic are considered: 100% organic, at least 95% organic, and made with organic ingredients (at least 70% organic). For local production, three levels are also included in the analysis: crossstate region (the Ohio Valley), state boundary (state-proud logos), as well as sub-state regions. Stated-preference data collected from a choice experiment in a mail survey in Kentucky and Ohio are used. Results from the study confirm positive willingness-to-pay for both organic and local attributes. However, consumers were willing to pay comparatively more for jam produced locally in regions smaller than the border of a state compared to organic jam. Furthermore, substitution and complementary effects between food attributes were investigated. The study found strong substitution effects between organic and local production claims, an issue that has thus far received minimal treatment in the existing literature on organic and local food willingness-to-pay studies. The results indicate a large degree of overlapping values in the willingness-to-pay for these two food attributes. In addition, the ""small farm"" attribute considered in the study also appears to be a substitute for organic and local attributes, which confirms the previous belief that one of the many reasons consumers purchase organic or local products is to support small or family-owned farms. © The Author 2015.","Choice experiment; Interaction effects; Local food; Organic food; Small farm product; Substitute and complementary attributes; Willingness-to-pay","Kentucky; Ohio; United States; Rubus; consumption behavior; food market; food quality; organic farming; substitution; willingness to pay","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84941578466"

Energy management is an integral part of the smart sustainable cities development programme which involves conscious and efficient use of available energy resources towards attaining sustainability and self-reliance on energy systems. Building sector is one of the key sectors that utilize more energy. Therefore, efforts are being made to monitor and manage energy consumption effectively in residential and commercial buildings. In recent years, non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) technique has become a popular and emerging approach to monitor events (on/off) and energy consumption of appliances/electrical utilities in buildings using single energy meter. The information about the energy consumption at the appliance level would help consumers to understand their appliance usage behavior and take necessary steps for reducing energy consumption. In this paper, we present the comprehensive review of state-of-the-art algorithms that have been explored by the researchers towards developing an accurate NILM system for effective energy management.

Whereas the option to return merchandise leads to an increase in gross revenue, it also creates additional costs. Selecting an optimal return policy requires balancing both demand and cost implications. In this paper, we develop a structural model of a consumer's decision to purchase and return an item that nests extant choice models as a special case. The model enables a firm to both measure the value to consumers of the return option and balance the costs and benefits of different return policies. We apply the model to a sample of data provided by a mail-order catalog company. We find considerable variation in the value of returns across customers and categories. When the option value is large, there are large increases in demand. For example, the option to return women's footwear is worth an average of more than $15 per purchase to customers and increases average purchase rates by more than 50%. We illustrate how the model can be used by a retailer to optimize his return policies across categories and customers. © 2009 INFORMS.","Choice models; Consumer behavior; Decisions under uncertainty; Direct marketing; E-commerce; Econometric models; Hierarchical Bayes analysis; Latent variable models; Marketing operations interface; Returns; Service quality; Targeting","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-66249102706"

The results are consistent with ‘buffer-stock’ models of consumption like those of Deaton [1991] or Carroll [1992a, 1992b], where precautionary motives greatly reduce the willingness of prudent consumers to consume out of uncertain future income. © 1994 by the President and Fellows of Harvard College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.","","consumption behaviour; income effect; projection model; theoretical studies; uncertainty","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0028600139"

A critical determinant of the profitability of such pricing policies is the extent to which consumers anticipate future price declines, and delay purchases. I develop a framework to investigate empirically the optimal pricing over time of a firm selling a durable-good product to such strategic consumers. Prices in the model are equilibrium outcomes of a game played between forward-looking consumers who strategically delay purchases to avail of lower prices in the future, and a forward-looking firm that takes this consumer behavior into account in formulating its optimal pricing policy. The model outlines first, a dynamic model of demand incorporating forward-looking consumer behavior, and second, an algorithm to compute the optimal dynamic sequence of prices given these demand estimates. The model is solved using numerical dynamic programming techniques. I present an empirical application to the market for video-games in the US. The results indicate that consumer forward-looking behavior has a significant effect on optimal pricing of games in the industry. Simulations reveal that the profit losses of ignoring forward-looking behavior by consumers are large and economically significant, and suggest that market research that provides information regarding the extent of discounting by consumers is valuable to video-game firms. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2007.","Durable-good pricing; Forward-looking consumers; Markov-perfect equilibrium; Numerical dynamic programming; Video-game industry","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-34548756657"

Brands have traditionally been studied only as an economic construct. Brands, as a social construct, have not yet been fully understood due to the lack of research. Design/methodology/ approach - The paper discusses major issues with references to existing literature and practical examples. Findings - In the conventional brand models the value of brand equity is defined and measured by its economic performance in financial terms. This model has a number of deficiencies. First, two basic elements are missing: legality and ethics, which form the foundation of brand equity. A good brand must be a legal as well as ethical one. Thus brand value needs to be assessed by both financial and ethical measures. Second, conventional brand models focus largely on product brands rather than corporate brands. Brands and branding have such a profound impact on the society as whole and not just on these people who buy them. There is a wider public, in addition to shareholders and consumers, who may be potentially affected by the branding decisions. The impact of branding on these stakeholders should also be taken into consideration. An ethical brand enhances the firm's reputation; such a reputation reinforces the brand in turn. On the other hand, any unethical behaviour will severely damage or even destroy the total intangible asset as evidenced by the recent high profile corporate scandals. Research limitations/implications - The paper questions the conventional branding practice, and explores the links between ethical branding and corporate social responsibility. Many questions remain to be addressed. Practical implications - Ethical branding could provide the company with a differential advantage as a growing number of consumers become more ethically conscious. It could also help overcome the increasing consumers' scepticism and cynicism towards branding communications. Originality/value - The paper is perhaps the first to raise the importance of ethics in branding. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Brand equity; Corporate branding; Corporate image; Ethics; Social responsibility","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-28344432078"

Think of Nike, Apple, Harley-Davidson: They're the brands every marketer regards with awe. But they are not built according to the principles of conventional marketing, says Harvard Business School marketing professor Douglas Holt Iconic brands beat the competition not just by delivering innovative benefits, services, or technologies but by forging a deep connection with the culture. A brand becomes an icon when it offers a compelling myth, a story that can help people resolve tensions in their lives. The deepest source of tension in modern society is the disparity between national ideology and the average citizen's reality. When ideologies shift, myths become even more important, and in America, the most potent myths are depictions of rebels. Mountain Dew has long offered a rebel myth in ads showing exciting, vital men who are far from the ideological model of success. Loyal customers drink the beverage to consume the myth. But Mountain Dew's greatest achievement is that it has retained its iconic power by creating fresh rebel myths to suit the tensions of each era: first the hillbilly, who stood in stark contrast to the organization man of the 1950s and 1960s; then the redneck, who rebelled against the investment bankers and consultants of the 1970s and 1980s; and most recently the slacker, who rejects the values and behaviors that, for the past decade, have marked the successful executive. Holt says marketers can learn from Mountain Dew and other iconic brands if they are willing to move beyond conventional brand management and acquire knowledge and skills they may not have. They must learn to target national contradictions instead of just consumer segments, create myths that make sense of confusing societal changes, and speak with a rebel's voice.","","Advertising; Beverages; Commerce; Consumer Satisfaction; Culture; Humans; Marketing; Mythology; Product Line Management; Social Values; United States; advertizing; article; beverage; commercial phenomena; consumer; cultural anthropology; hospital management; human; literature; marketing; methodology; social psychology; United States","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-1642314637"

We then offer examples of the practices that are emerging, specifically the increase in imaginative resources that interactive media provide; practices that actualize probable, everyday commodities and experiences in the digital virtual and practices that actualize fantastic commodities and experiences in the digital virtual. Finally, we discuss the potential for these to produce new consumer subjectivities and new markets, and as a result we conclude with a discussion of the implications of such developments for consumer cultures, noting the potential for both liberatory/celebratory and critical discourse as well as avenues for future research.","Desire; Digital virtual consumption; Fantasy; Imagination; Internet; Liminal spaces; Video games","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-79960127515"

This paper engages with calls to follow the thing but argues that work thus far has been concentrated, first, on global flows from developing world producers to developed world consumers, and, second, on things that remain stable as they circulate. This paper instead argues that 'follow the thing' research needs to also attend to flows 'down' the value chain, from developed to less developed worlds, and to things that are either coming apart or being disassembled. The case presented here is end-of-life ships, sent to be broken in less developed countries, as most are, in this case in Bangladesh. It looks at how the arts of transience re-work materials from rubbish value ships into new forms and objects in the household furnishing sector, which are then appropriated by Bangladeshi middle class consumers. Far from being a minor feature this is shown to be empirically a significant component of the Bangladeshi economy. Theoretically the paper challenges many habitual assumptions about global flows of commodities and urges 'follow the thing' research to rethink the thing. Paying attention to the back-end of the value chain shows that things are but temporary configurations of material. At best partially stable, things are argued to be endlessly being assembled, always becoming something else somewhere else. © 2010.","Bangladesh; Consumption; Follow the thing; Furniture; Ships; Value chains; Waste","Bangladesh; commodity; commodity market; consumption behavior; developing world; national economy","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-77953491865"

Results indicate that the cultural characteristics of power distance and uncertainty avoidance [Hofstede 1980] influence the focus of consumers’ product information search activities, but not their tendencies to share product-related opinions with others.

Design/methodology/approach - Using responses from patrons of different hair salons, the role that salon atmospherics had on the formation of CCI was assessed. Then, the relative influence of CCI on satisfaction with the firm, loyalty to the firm and firm word-of-mouth, in a model of service outcomes, was examined. Findings - Results indicate that atmospherics do influence CCI, which in turn is a strong predictor of loyalty to the firm and positive word-of-mouth. Research limitations/implications - Care should be taken when generalizing these findings to other service settings. It should be noted that all female respondents were generally more educated and had higher incomes than the general population. Practical implications - This study suggests that positive perceptions of atmospherics will lead to positive CCI effects. If managers determine that they would like to enhance the quality of CCI, they should incorporate changes to the physical settings that enhance the type of interactions they desire. Originality/value - In terms of how to assess CCI, the authors provide a simple four-item scale which can be used by managers to assess the degree in which their customers interact and the effect that the interaction has on their experience. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Consumer behaviour; Customer loyalty; Interpersonal relations; Services marketing; Social interaction","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-28044437723"

The present paper contributes to this debate by investigating the propensity of consumers to give in to temptation on second-hand peer-to-peer (P2P) platforms, which provide a favorable context for self-licensing behaviors. A survey was conducted in 2015 amongst 541 active buyers on the French P2P platform leboncoin (equivalent of US craigslist) addressing questions relative to their buying activities in the previous year. The results show that materialistic and environmentally conscious consumers are more likely (than consumers who are not materialistic and environmentally conscious) to be tempted in the context of second-hand P2P platforms as these offer justifications that help reduce consumption-related cognitive dissonance. This finding corroborates the counterproductive role of collaborative consumption for sustainability in certain conditions. Theoretically, the research contributes to further developing the emerging self-licensing theory in the context of second-hand P2P platforms and understanding impulse buying on this new web interface. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Cognitive dissonance; Indulgent consumption; P2P platforms; Second-hand shopping; Self-licensing","Distributed computer systems; Sustainable development; Buying activity; Cognitive dissonance; Impulse buying; Indulgent consumption; P2P platforms; Public policy makers; Second-hand shopping; Sustainable consumption; consumption behavior; shopping activity; survey; sustainability; theoretical study; Consumer behavior","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85016798269"

Currently, voice is embedded in a variety of products such as smartphones (mobile applications) and smart speakers in consumers' homes. Furthermore, voice assistants are becoming integral to our daily lives. While human personalities shape the way we interact with the world, voice assistant personalities can also impact everyday interactions with our environment. This study identifies seven voice assistant personality traits (VAP) of three commonly used mobile applications: Microsoft's Cortana, Google's Assistant, and Amazon's Alexa. To examine the effect of VAP on consumer experience, this study applies and extends flow theory to uncover why VAP has the effects it has and what facets of VAP drive the voice interaction flow experience that can influence consumers' attitudes and behavioral intentions. Our study shows that voice interaction with a VA that incorporates functional intelligence, sincerity, and creativity empowers consumers to take control of their voice interactions with the VA, focus on their voice interaction, and engage in exploratory behavior. Consumers' exploratory behavior leads to consumer satisfaction and consumers' willingness to continue using voice assistant. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Control; Exploratory behavior; Focused attention; Satisfaction; Voice assistant personality (VAP); Voice interaction flow experience; Willingness to continue using voice assistant (VA)","Alexa; artificial intelligence; consumption behavior; mobile phone","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85090002863"

Design/methodology/approach – The study is based on cross-sectional data collected through a questionnaire survey. Respondents' attitudes towards the organic and SIM certification systems are examined. A principal component analysis (PCA) with varimax rotation was primarily applied to provide a more manageable set of variables relevant to attitudes. Those attitudes together with socioeconomic factors and variables relevant to respondents' motivations to food consumption were used for the estimation of the WTP for organic and SIM products. Findings – Findings suggest that consumers' level of awareness and information towards the studied certification systems is rather low especially for SIM products. This can be mainly attributed to the inadequate promotion and the low availability of certified products in the Greek market. The study also reveals that the WTP for organic products is higher among consumers who place much importance on health, consume organic fruits/vegetables and get information about food/nutrition issues from doctors/nutritionists/health institutes and magazines. WTP for SIM products is affected mainly by married consumers, regular buyers of organic products and those who consume frequently fruits/vegetables. Originality/value – This paper provides an outline of the level of awareness and trust of food quality certification systems by Greek consumers, a topic that has not been widely discussed in Greece. The findings can help all the involved bodies to avoid the impediments and develop an adequate marketing strategy for the effective promotion of certified food products. © 2006, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Attitudes; Consumer behaviour; Organic foods; Quality","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-31144463386"

Using samples from two countries (USA, n = 120 and Korea, n = 128), this study explored a path model centered on consumers' reluctance to purchase foreign goods. The findings indicated that, in the US sample only, consumer ethnocentrism plays a mediating role, between global openness and the reluctance to buy, although it is on the decrease with the increasing level of global openness. Consumer ethnocentrism is still an important factor in determining the magnitude of reluctance to buy a foreign product in both samples, while product judgment also plays an important role, but only in a certain cultural context (i.e. the USA). It is concluded, therefore, that consumers in a different culture, who are different in their attitudes and perceptions, tastes and preferences, and values, are still different even after being exposed to the massive wave of globalization.","Consumer behaviour; Globalization; International marketing; National cultures","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0442264928"

Findings revealed that recessionary cues-whether naturally occurring or experimentally primed-decreased desire for most products (e.g., electronics, household items). However, these cues consistently increased women's desire for products that increase attractiveness to mates-the first experimental demonstration of the lipstick effect.

This trend is also apparent for the wine industry, which has gradually been adopting organic production methods. Motivated by the increasing importance of consumer health protection, this paper analyzes consumer interest in buying organic wines with no additives, evaluating whether and to what extent consumers are willing to pay a higher price for organic wine with no added sulfites. With the aim to gain detailed knowledge about issues related to consumer health an ordered logit model was used to investigate the probability of achieving a premium prices as a function of the socioeconomic characteristics of consumers and the product attributes. Results indicate that environmental consciousness, and curiosity lead consumers to pay a higher price for these wines while naturalness and designation of origin are the attributes of organic wines positively related to the probability of paying a premium price for wine with no added sulfites. The results also show that inappropriate information discourage consumers from paying a price differential for wine without sulfites. The scientific value and originality of the paper include consumer perception of the health benefits of organic wines without additives. The outcomes confirm that consumers who are sensitive to environmental and quality issues are willing to pay a premium for quality food, and that wider information about wine with no added sulfites is required for effective price differentiation. Being Sulfite addition to food is an issue of increasing relevance in the agro-food sector, this study analyzes for the first time the consumer preference for organic wines by considering how the presence of additives in wine affect the purchasing behavior of consumers. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Ordered logit; Price premium; Purchase intentions; Sustainable wines; Wine without added sulfites","Consumer protection; Costs; Health; Wine; Consumer perception; Consumer preferences; Ordered logit; Price differentiation; Price premiums; Purchase intention; Purchasing behaviors; Socioeconomic characteristics; Consumer behavior","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84960857964"

Design/methodology/approach - An integrated model is proposed following the studies by Ang et al. and Huang et al. A survey with 400 consumers was conducted in the Brazilian market and the Structural Equation Modeling technique was used to test the hypothesized relationships. Findings - The main contribution of the paper is to show that consumer intentions to buy counterfeited products are dependent on the attitudes they have toward counterfeits, which in turn are more influenced by perceived risk, whether consumers have bought a counterfeit before, subjective norm, integrity, price-quality inference and personal gratification. The paper reinforces the mediator role of attitude in the relationship between these antecedents and behavioral intentions. Moreover, previous experience with counterfeits consumption does not have a direct effect on behavioral intentions, but only an indirect effect through attitude. Practical implications - The paper contributes to inform policy makers and managers of brands about the main predictors of consumer's attitudes toward counterfeits. In this way, ads intended to discourage consumption of counterfeits could use the perceived risk as the main message appeal.

As a result, a case is made for the application of evolutionary psychology to marketing, and especially consumer behavior. Application of the evolutionary framework in studying gender-related consumption behavior is illustrated by comparing the evolutionary predictions with results obtained from previous studies, by supporting these predictions with market-level consumption data, and by proposing new hypotheses based on this framework. Also discussed are the potential applications of evolutionary psychology to other consumption-related phenomena like evaluation of endorser attractiveness in advertising, biologically driven consumption choices among women, consumer-experienced emotions in service encounters, and consumption choices as inclusive fitness maximization rather than utility maximization. © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0034348120"

The present study examined whether, compared with socio-economic variables (age, gender, education level, personal income, and household income), the personality variable sensation seeking adds to the ability to predict differences in various attitudes and behaviours of wine tourists. With the effects of the former controlled, sensation seeking was observed to be significantly related to spending on wine, and wine drinking, as well as to the frequency of visits to wineries and the number of activities engaged in at wineries, the use of the internet as a source of information about wineries, venturing off the beaten track during a visit to a wine region, and the strength of opportunity for learning, stimulation, or indulgence as incentives to visit a wine region. Sensation seeking was also observed to be significantly related to all but one of those variables when the effects of another variable which is receiving increasing attention as a means by which to characterize wine tourists, ""involvement"", were controlled.

We review two promising alternatives-the constructivist approach centering on schemas and the intersubjectivist approach centering on norms-and the evidence that demonstrates their usefulness in accounting for international differences in the behavior of managers, employees, and consumers. We propose a situated dynamics framework, specifying the role of values, schemas, and norms in accounting for cultural differences, and delineating conditions under which each causal mechanism is operative. Values play a more important role in accounting for cultural differences in weak situations where fewer constraints are perceived; schemas play a more important role when situational cues increase their accessibility and relevance; and norms play a more important role when social evaluation is salient.

A probabilistic-model based situation assessment module using conditional random field was proposed to assess the risk level of surrounding traffic participants. Based on the assessed risk from the situation assessment module, a collision avoidance strategy with driving style preferences (e.g., aggressive or conservative) was proposed to meet the demands of different drivers or passengers. Finally, we conducted experiments in Carla (car learning to act) to evaluate our developed collision avoidance decision-making algorithm in different scenarios. The results show that our developed method was sufficiently reliable for autonomous vehicles to avoid collisions in multi-scenarios with different driving style preferences. Our developed method with adjustable driving style preferences to meet the demand of different consumers would improve drivers’ acceptance of autonomous vehicles. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Advanced driver assistance system; Autonomous vehicle; Collision avoidance; Decision-making; Risk assessment","Collision avoidance; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Collision avoidance decisions; Conditional random field; Decision-making algorithms; Driving styles; Multi scenarios; Probabilistic modeling; Risk levels; Situation assessment; algorithm; car use; collision avoidance; decision making; preference behavior; risk assessment; traffic management; travel demand; unmanned vehicle; Autonomous vehicles","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097717263"

Such purchases are characterized by limited repeat purchase behavior of the same product item (such as a book title) but significant past usage experience with other products of the same type (such as books of the same genre). To cope with the uncertainty in quality of the product item, we posit that consumers may learn from their experience with the same type of product and others' experiences with the product item. We model the review credibility as the precision with which product reviews reflect the consumer's own product evaluation. The higher the precision, the more credible the information obtained from product reviews for the consumer, and the larger the effect of reviews on the consumer's choice probabilities. We extend the Bayesian learning framework to model consumer learning on both product quality and review credibility. We apply the model to a panel data set of 1,919 book purchases by 243 consumers. We find that consumers learn more from online reviews of book titles than from their own experience with other books of the same genre. In the counterfactual analysis, we illustrate the profit impact of product reviews and how it varies with the number of reviews. We also study the phenomenon of fake reviews. We find that fake reviews increase consumer uncertainty. The effects of more positive reviews and more numerous reviews on consumer choice are smaller on online retailing platforms that have fake product reviews. © 2013 INFORMS.","Choice models; Learning models; Product reviews","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84873302047"

The objective of this research was to study how health claims affect consumers' perception of other product attributes. A survey with a total of 4612 respondents from the Nordic countries explored consumers' perceptions of attractiveness, healthiness, naturalness, tastiness and ability to reduce risk of disease by comparing ratings of products with and without health claims. Used claims varied in their benefit, active ingredient, claim structure and framing. The results showed that health claims had a moderate but mostly negative impact on the. perception of other product attributes; the most significant impact was decrease in perceived naturalness. Consumers could also interpret the benefits in claims as intended. The wording of the claim had only small impact on the perception of the products, whereas earlier market presence of the ingredient had a large impact: differences among the Nordic countries reflected the previous exposure to health claims. The findings from this study suggest that consumers do not imply other health benefits from health claims and the health claim per se is not likely to cause any unrealistic positive inferences in perceived product quality. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Attitude; Consumer; Food choice; Health claim; Healthiness; Product attributes; Product quality","Scandinavia; consumption behavior; food quality; food selection; health impact; nutrition; perception; public attitude","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-77952543722"

However, for complete acceptance of green energy, only government regulations are not enough; the willingness to use green energy and contribute to the wellbeing of the environment should spring from within consumers. Such willingness may be developed by enhancing consumers’ perceived value of green energy. However, in order to do so, it is necessary to assess existing levels of consumers’ perceived value towards green energy. The present study develops a multidimensional green perceived value scale to measure existing levels of consumers’ perceived value. The scale considers green perceived value as a multidimensional second order construct comprising functional value, social value, conditional value and emotional value dimensions. Such an attempt has not been made before which highlights the originality value of the present study. The scale can be used to assess consumers’ perception towards green energy. Such information would help in formulating strategies that encourage consumers to voluntarily adopt green energy. The study also reveals that it is not only the financial aspects that lead consumers to decide on adoption of green energy; consumers are also driven by emotional and social considerations. Thus, policy makers could formulate pro-green energy programmes and mass messages that appeal to consumers’ sense of responsibility to voluntarily adopt green energy without having to rely on financial incentives. Researchers could examine the considered dimensions of the scale further with respect to other constructs related to consumer behaviour. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Consumer behaviour; Green energy; Post purchase evaluation","Consumer behavior; Laws and legislation; Environmental damage; Financial aspects; Financial incentives; Government regulation; Green energy; Post purchase evaluation; Second-order constructs; Value dimensions; Behavioral research","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85016501766"

The first set investigates how divulgence is affected by signals about others' readiness to divulge and shows a ""herding"" effect: Survey respondents are more willing to divulge sensitive information when told that previous respondents have made sensitive disclosures (Study 1a). The authors provide evidence of the process underlying this effect and rule out alternative explanations by showing that information on others' propensity to disclose affects respondents' discomfort associated with divulgence (Study 1b) but not their interpretation of the questions (Study 1c). The second set of studies investigates how divulgence is affected by the order in which inquiries of varying intrusiveness are made and suggests that divulgence is anchored by the initial questions in a survey. People are particularly likely to divulge when questions are presented in decreasing order of intrusiveness and less likely when questions are presented in increasing order (Study 2a). The authors show that the effect arises by affecting people's judgments of the intrusiveness of the inquiries (Study 2b). The effect is altered when, at the outset of the study, privacy concerns are primed (Study 2c) and when respondents are made to consider the relative intrusiveness of a different set of questions (Study 2d).

In this paper,we seek to understand and measure the causal impact of tablets on e-commerce sales.

We rely on a unique data set from Alibaba, the largest e-commerce firm in the world, and exploit a natural experiment via the iPad app introduction to empirically identify our results. The results show that users' adoption of tablets enhanced the overall growth of Alibaba's e-commerce market, with an annual increase of approximately US$923.5 million. Our results demonstrate that the tablet channel acts as a substitute for the PC channel while it acts as a complement for the smartphone channel. Furthermore, the use of tablets spurs casual browsing, which leads to the purchase of more impulse products and a wider diversity of products. Cross-device browsing behavior is found to enhance sales outcomes, and the degree of interrelationships between devices varies across the course of the day.

Therefore, strategies that aim to reduce food waste have great potential to improve sustainability of the agricultural and food supply chains. Consumer-related food waste is a complex issue that needs collaboration between various supply chain actors and sector stakeholders. Although a range of initiatives from various actors already exists internationally, there is still a lack of knowledge on which lessons can be derived from such cases. The current multiple case study provides insights into how to successfully design future actions, by analysing common and distinct key success factors in 26 existing initiatives to reduce consumer-related food waste. The findings reveal that collaboration between stakeholders, timing and sequence of initiatives, competencies that the initiative is built on, and a large scale of operations are key success factors. Success factors are identified for the primary design, for the development and maintenance phase, and for reaching out to consumers. There are three general types of initiatives that differ in their aims and characteristics: information and capacity building, redistribution, and retail and supply chain alteration. The first type focuses most strongly on motivating consumer food waste avoidance behaviour and strengthening consumer abilities, while the second and third focus primarily on altering consumer food choice context, but combine this with aspects of raising awareness. Recommendations are derived for future initiatives which should take inspiration from existing initiatives, especially considering the right partners, competencies involved, timing the start of the initiative right, and aim to soon achieve a large scale. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Case study; Consumers; Food waste; Initiatives; Success factors; Supply chain","Environmental impact; Food supply; Sustainable development; Consumers; Food waste; Initiatives; Key characteristics; Key success factors; Multiple-case study; Success factors; Supply chain actors; Supply chains","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85007413949"

This study tests four hypotheses concerning the relationship between religiosity, nationality, and consumer behavior on samples of American Protestant and Japanese consumers. Because of the unified nature of Japanese religion, the Japanese respondents were considered members of the same religion. In the case of nationality, it was found, as anticipated, that Japanese and Americans differed significantly in some aspects of consumer behavior. In regard to religiosity, there were no significant differences between the consumer behavior of the devout and casually religious Japanese, whereas the devout American Protestants had considerably different consumer behavior than the casually religious Protestants. Thus, the research findings suggest that further study of these factors holds promise for greater insight in the development of international marketing strategies. © 1995.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0002339289"

But for most service businesses, they are key inputs to the production process. Customers introduce tremendous variability to that process, but they also complain about any lack of consistency and don't care about the company's profit agenda. Managing customer-introduced variability, the author argues, is a central challenge for service companies. The first step is to diagnose which type of variability is causing mischief: Customers may arrive at different times, request different kinds of service, possess different capabilities, make varying degrees of effort, and have different personal preferences. Should companies accommodate variability or reduce it? Accommodation often involves asking employees to compensate for the variations among customers-a potentially costly solution. Reduction often means offering a limited menu of options, which may drive customers away. Some companies have learned to deal with customer-introduced variability without damaging either their operating environments or customers' service experiences. Starbucks, for example, handles capability variability among its customers by teaching them the correct ordering protocol. Dell deals with arrival and request variability in its high-end server business by out-sourcing customer service while staying in close touch with customers to discuss their needs and assess their experiences with third-party providers. The effective management of variability often requires a company to influence customers' behavior. Managers attempting that kind of intervention can follow a three-step process: diagnosing the behavioral problem, designing an operating role for customers that creates new value for both parties, and testing and refining approaches for influencing behavior.","","Commerce; Consumer Satisfaction; Efficiency, Organizational; United States; article; commercial phenomena; consumer; organization and management; United States","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-33750912608"

Additionally, the results assert that, over time (following the usage phase), positive attitudes towards the app results in increased purchase frequency through the app, positive attitudes and loyalty towards the brand.

The purpose of this paper is to understand the food waste behaviour of consumers to support policies for minimising food waste. Design/methodology/approach: Using the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) as a theoretical lens, the authors design a questionnaire that incorporates contextual factors to explain food waste behaviour. The authors test two models: base (four constructs of TPB) and extended (four constructs of TPB plus six contextual factors). The authors build partial least squares structural equation models to test the hypotheses. Findings: The data confirm significant relationships between food waste and contextual factors such as motives, financial attitudes, planning routines, food surplus, social relationships and Ramadan. Research limitations/implications: The data comes from an agriculturally resource-constrained country: Qatar. Practical implications: Food waste originating from various causes means more food should flow through the supply chains to reach consumers’ homes. Contextual factors identified in this work increase the explanatory power of the base model by 75 per cent. Social implications: Changing eating habits during certain periods of the year and food surplus have a strong impact on food waste behaviour. Originality/value: A country is considered to be food secure if it can provide its citizens with stable access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food. The findings and conclusions inform and impact upon the development of food waste and food security policies. © 2018, Emel Aktas, Hafize Sahin, Zeynep Topaloglu, Akunna Oledinma, Abul Kalam Samsul Huda, Zahir Irani, Amir M.

Design/methodology/approach: Based on personal interviews with over 300 UK consumers, the paper investigates the relative impact of COI and brand image as independent drivers (""orthogonality"" perspective), and as causally-linked drivers (""irradiation"" perspective) on consumers' intentions to buy specific US and Chinese brands. Findings: Controlling for the effects of brand familiarity, the analysis shows that COI impacts purchase intentions indirectly in that its influence is fully mediated by brand image. These findings are consistent with an ""irradiation"" perspective of COI effects and demonstrate that brand image evaluations already encapsulate consumers' COI perceptions. Research limitations/implications: Based on the country/brand combinations investigated, the results show that the recent criticism against the COO construct is largely unfounded and that the construct remains relevant to international marketing theory and practice. Practical implications: COO remains a relevant and powerful influence on brand perceptions and, through them, on buying intentions and needs to be carefully managed by companies. Originality/value: The paper provides explicit empirical comparison of alternative models depicting potential COO influence on behavioural outcomes (brand image evaluations and purchase intentions) in distinct country/brand combinations. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Brand image; Consumer behaviour; Country of origin","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-80052606859"

However, the existing literature lacks an overarching theory to explain the breadth of findings across different types of resources. To address this, we introduce a self-regulatory model of resource scarcity. In it, we propose that consumers respond to resource scarcity through two distinct psychological pathways: a scarcity-reduction route aimed at reducing the discrepancy in resources and a control-restoration route aimed at reestablishing diminished personal control by attaining security in other domains. We explain how a key determinant of which route the consumer will pursue is the perceived mutability of the resource discrepancy. We also specify moderators, based on our proposed model, to identify when each of the two routes is pursued. This model is assessed in the context of alternative theoretical perspectives, including commodity theory, life history theory, and models of compensatory behavior. Finally, we provide a research agenda for those interested in studying the psychology of resource scarcity from a self-regulatory perspective. © 2018 Society for Consumer Psychology","Commodity theory; Compensatory consumption; Financial deprivation; Life history theory; Resource scarcity; Self-regulation","","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85042431501"

We show that in any Pareto-optimal allocation whether each consumer vanishes or survives is determined entirely by discount factors and beliefs. Whereas equilibrium allocations in economies with complete markets are Pareto optimal, our results characterize the limit behavior of these economies. We show that, all else equal, the market selects for consumers who use Bayesian learning with the truth in the support of their prior and selects among Bayesians according to the size of their parameter space. Finally, we show that in economies with incomplete markets, these conclusions may not hold. With incomplete markets, payoff functions can matter for long-run survival, and the market selection hypothesis fails.","Bayesian learning; Heterogeneous consumers; Market selection hypothesis; Rational expectations","","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-33745322121"

However, there is a crucial element of the smart tourism ecosystem that has been rather neglected in research hitherto: the tourists themselves. By acknowledging a shift in tourists’ behaviour due to the advent of disruptive factors, this paper conceptualises the recently emerged notion of ‘the smart tourist’. This new type of tourist is profiled through a description of their attitudes and behaviours, and their role within the smart destination scenario is depicted. By taking a consumer-centric perspective and framing the conceptualisation within the relevant theories, this paper contributes to the current body of knowledge on tourism in a highly technological context and facilitates bridging smart tourism theoretical foundations with empirical research. The observed transformation in tourists’ behaviour and its encapsulation in the smart tourist conceptualisation reveal critical managerial implications for both destination management organisations and businesses in the rapidly changing smart tourism ecosystem. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","ICTs; Smart tourism; smart tourism destination; smart tourist; tourist behaviour","conceptual framework; information and communication technology; scenario analysis; tourism management; tourist behavior; tourist destination","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85051936984"

Previous research, which has focused on mavens' demographics and media consumption, has neglected the motives that drive these consumer communicators. From a survey of 326 consumers, we explore how those respondents ranked high on the maven scale differ in terms of their motivations to engage in word-of-mouth behavior from those scoring lower on the maven scale. Our results indicate that market mavens, compared with moderate and non-mavens, are motivated to a greater extent by a sense of obligation to share information, a desire to help others, and feelings of pleasure associated with informing others about products. The relationship between initial information diffusion, maven group, and the investigated motivations are also explored.

As the scope of this research, this current study focuses on determining consumers’ purchase decisions regarding green products using a survey conducted in a fast-growing developing country. This research was descriptive and considered a conceptual framework for extending the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), which was selected as the primary theoretical model. The significant contributions and main objectives of this study are as follows—to explore the present scenario of green marketing in Bangladesh with previous studies, and to fill a research gap regarding green purchase decisions by applying the TPB model with adding additional constructs, such as environmental concerns, green perceived quality, and future green estimates. A range of qualitative and quantitative techniques were adopted to collect data from the target groups, where a sample of young educated Bangladeshi consumers (n = 638) was used to consider the measurement and structural models by applying a partial least squares-structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) method. The empirical findings show that consumers’ environmental concern (EC), green perceived benefits (GPB), green awareness of price (GAP), green willingness to purchase (GWP), and future estimation of green marketing (GFE) have a strong positive influence on consumer’ green purchase decision (GPD). Still, the green perceived quality (GPQ) has a negative influence on green purchase decisions (GPD). To inform consumers about green or eco-friendly products, this study provides valuable suggestions to companies, marketers, and policymakers for designing green marketing tools such as green advertising, green branding, and eco-labels. Based on these findings, it gives some managerial insights for the promotion of green products and green marketing. © 2020 by the authors.

Design/methodology/approach: Survey data collected from 497 mobile value-added service consumers were examined using structural equation modeling to validate the research model. Findings: The results indicate that the mobile service attributes of personalization, identifiability, and perceived enjoyment have significant positive influences on the key brand equity factors, including brand loyalty, perceived quality, brand awareness, and brand associations. Additionally, the results confirm the significance of all four of the brand equity factors in interpreting consumer purchase intention in the context of mobile value-added service consumption. Practical implications: The research results provide insights into how mobile value-added services may be better designed and delivered to enhance brand equity and, in turn, profits. Originality/value: While the market potential of mobile value-added services and the importance of brand equity have both been widely recognized, the development and empirical validation of a model that specifically depicts the determinants of mobile value-added service consumption from a brand-equity perspective has not yet been undertaken. Consequently, this study investigates the relationships among key m-commerce attributes, core brand-equity components, and consumer behaviors. The research results have extended the application and advanced the understanding of previous mobile-commerce and brand-equity theories in the context of mobile value-added service consumption. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Brand equity; Brand management; Consumer behaviour; Electronic commerce; M-commerce attribute; Mobile commerce; Mobile services; Value chain","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84863390914"

We hypothesize that, by reducing product uncertainty, product reviews affect the probability of product returns. We elaborate this hypothesis starting with an analytical model that examines how changes in valence and precision of information from product reviews influence the purchase and return probabilities of risk-averse, but rational, consumers. We then empirically test our hypotheses using a transaction-level data set from a multichannel, multibrand North American specialty retailer. Harnessing different consumers' purchases and returns of the same products, but with varying sets of product reviews over two years, we show that the availability of more reviews and the presence of more ""helpful"" reviews, as voted by consumers, lead to fewer product returns-after controlling for customer, product, and other context-related factors. Analyzing the purchase behavior of the consumers, we find that when fewer product reviews are available, consumers buy more substitutes in conjunction with a product, potentially to mitigate their uncertainty. Purchase of substitutes, in turn, leads to more product returns. Finally, leveraging a discontinuity in the displayed average ratings, we find that when products are shown with an average rating that is higher than the true rating, they are returned more often. These results support the predictions of our theoretical model-unbiased online reviews indeed help consumers make better purchase decisions, leading to lower product returns; biasing reviews upward results in more returns. The presence of online reviews has important cost implications for the firm beyond the cost of reprocessing the returns; we observe that when consumers return products, they are more likely to write online reviews and that these reviews are more negative than reviews that follow a nonreturned purchase. © 2018 INFORMS.","Product returns; Product reviews; Quality of purchase decision; Regression discontinuity","Aircraft manufacture; Consumer behavior; Purchasing; Statistical tests; Uncertainty analysis; Online product reviews; Product returns; Product reviews; Product uncertainties; Purchase decision; Regression discontinuity; Return probabilities; Theoretical modeling; Sales","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85049954369"

Yet, it is only during the 20th century that marketing ideas evolved into an academic discipline in its own right. Most concepts, issues and problems of marketing thought have coalesced into one of several schools or approaches to understanding marketing. In this article we trace the evolution of 10 schools of marketing thought. At the turn of the 20th century, early in the discipline's history, the study of functions, commodities, and institutions emerged as complementary modes of thinking about subject matter and became known collectively as the ‘traditional approaches’ to studying marketing; shortly thereafter the interregional trade approach emerged. About mid-century, there was a ‘paradigm shift’ in marketing thought eclipsing the traditional approaches as a number of newer schools developed: marketing management, marketing systems, consumer behavior, macromarketing, exchange, and marketing history. During the mid 1970s, three of the modern schools - marketing management, consumer behavior, and exchange - underwent a ‘paradigm broadening’. The broadened paradigm has bifurcated marketing thought from the conventional domain of business behavior to the much broader domain of all human social behavior. Thus, at the beginning of the 21st century marketing thought is at a crossroads. © 2005, Sage Publications.

We develop and demonstrate a biosocial conceptualization of pleasure and show how the shared experience of music and dance, the organization of space, and the effects of the drug ecstasy combine to produce a highly sought-after, calculated suspension of the rules and norms of everyday life. Further, we suggest that the club, as well as the pleasurable practices and experiences that it supports, has become a site of contained illegality.

However, there exists great semantic confusion within academic literature surrounding the term ""sharing economy,"" which threatens the realisation of its purported sustainability potential. (2) Objective: The aim of this paper is to synthesise the existing academic definitions and propose a definition of the sharing economy from the perspective of sustainability science in order to indicate sharing practices that are consistent with the sustainability claims attributed to the sharing economy. (3) Methods: We conduct a database search to collect relevant academic articles. Then, we leverage qualitative content analysis in order to analyse the authors' definitions and to synthesise the broad dimensions of the sharing economy in the discourse. (4) Results: We propose the following characteristics, or semantic properties, of the sharing economy for sustainability: ICTmediated, non-pecuniary motivation for ownership, temporary access, rivalrous and tangible goods. (5) Conclusion: The semantic properties that inform our definition of the sharing economy for sustainability indicate those sharing practices that promote sustainable consumption compared to purely market-based exchanges. This definition is relevant for academics studying the sustainability impacts of the sharing economy in order to promote comparability and compatibility in research.

The authors describe three laboratory studies in the context of a price promotion that is designed to increase trial in a service industry. Results suggest that consistency with past promotional behavior, distinctiveness in terms of how common it is to promote in an industry, and consumer expertise are important variables that moderate when price promotions have an unfavorable effect on brand evaluations. The authors highlight implications for service providers that are offering promotions to attract new customers in industries in which promotions are uncommon and discuss the theoretical implications of the finding that expertise moderates the effects of dislinctiveness and consistency on evaluations in the context of price promotions.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0033247801"

A multi-method approach examines the perceived motivations that impact consumers' willingness to access products through socially networked short-term rentals.

To date, despite growing interest and some initial attempts, their potential to engage consumers in energy efficiency behaviours has been understudied. To provide an overview of serious games and gamification to engage individuals in pro-environmental behaviours for energy efficiency, a computer-based search for relevant publications was performed in several databases. After applying the inclusion criteria and removing duplicates, 10 papers were included in this systematic review. Results showed that serious games and gamification have been used in three different areas related to energy efficiency: environmental education, consumption awareness, and pro-environmental behaviours. This review also showed that applied gaming interventions can be used in more than one of these three areas (comprehensive interventions). The main observation to be drawn from this review is that both serious games and gamification can foster energy-saving behaviours and vary widely in terms of type of games and of features that might be appealing and motivating. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Applied gaming; Energy efficiency; Energy-saving; Gamification; Serious games","","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85019915986"

Design/methodology/approach - The discussion of neuromarketing in this paper is based on reports of both a theoretical and applied nature. Their contents have been synthesized and placed into context by showing how they relate to traditional marketing research approaches and assumptions. Findings - While there are no concrete findings, preliminary assessments suggest that traditional, inferential assumptions about consumer behavior might be less powerful and explanatory than once believed. Combining neural activity images with conventional tools may produce more effective marketing practices. Research limitations/implications - Because this is an emerging field and still controversial, some of the key information is proprietary and/or fairly presumptive at this time. Cautions and criticisms have been included to counterbalance that point. Practical implications - Understanding what is happening in this emerging field of inquiry is essential for anyone who believes that marketers can change the probability of a favorable response from consumers. The use of neuromarketing, if proven through use, has the capability of fundamentally changing how we design, promote, price, and package our products. Originality/value - The marriage of cognitive neuroscience and marketing practice is a new field of inquiry.

We propose that sex ratio also has pervasive effects in humans, such as by influencing economic decisions. Using both historical data and experiments, we examined how sex ratio influences saving, borrowing, and spending in the United States. Findings show that male-biased sex ratios (an abundance of men) lead men to discount the future and desire immediate rewards. Male-biased sex ratios decreased men's desire to save for the future and increased their willingness to incur debt for immediate expenditures. Sex ratio appears to influence behavior by increasing the intensity of same-sex competition for mates. Accordingly, a scarcity of women led people to expect men to spend more money during courtship, such as by paying more for engagement rings. These findings demonstrate experimentally that sex ratio influences human decision making in ways consistent with evolutionary biological theory.

It is an identity, a philosophy and a culture. As a business sector and management discipline, these characteristics signify the presence of challenges in the integration of luxury branding within the Internet and digital environment and the requirement of intricate strategies to overcome them. Recent publications have raised the issues of the compatibility of luxury and the Internet, the suitability of luxury goods in the virtual environment and strategic approaches to maximising a luxury brand's presence online. Others have indicated that the Internet is a dilemma that luxury requires to overcome through avoiding e-Commerce, whereas other literature have suggested that the Internet is purely a channel of communications for luxury brands. The question of the state of luxury in the digital context, however, remains largely unexplored, particularly with regards to the particularities of luxury management, which have posed a challenge in adopting digital technologies in the sector over the past two decades. Until recently, the luxury industry showed low commitment towards integrating advanced Internet technologies and its accompanying interactive and digital tools in the sector's marketing and overall business strategies. They also seemed to be pushed to be present and conduct business on the Internet as a result of evolving consumer needs and expectations. Notable international brands such as Versace and Prada did not have corporate websites until 2005 and 2007, respectively. The economic as well as consumer societies have also expressed bewilderment at the slowness of the luxury industry in establishing an online presence in comparison to other sectors. These parties have been right to question this crucial issue particularly since the Internet has become an indispensable channel of modern business. As an industry that is known for innovation, avant-gardism and creativity, it may not be apparent why luxury brands and digital technology have been perceived as incompatible since the advent of the Internet and digital communications technology. However, as with every case of reverse human behaviour, this may be explained through the examination of the very core of luxury. This paper examines the core and scope of luxury as a business disciple, particularly in the dimension of branding within the digital context. It investigates the true nature of luxury as a current management science and identifies its key drivers and their scope of integration within the Internet environment.

Specifically, we investigate how and why consumers may transition toward adopting and using new pro-environmental technologies (PETs), namely electric vehicles, solar panels, and a green electricity program. We build a conceptual framework from lifestyle theory, where lifestyle is defined as a grouping of related practices that can reflect and inform the consumer's self-concept (or identity). We apply this framework using a novel quantitative survey method, implemented with a representative sample of 711 San Diego households. Through factor analysis, we identify engagement in pro-environmental practices as independent of engagement in other lifestyle types. We then group respondents into five clusters based on lifestyle engagement, attitudes and openness to lifestyle change (liminality). The three clusters with green attitudes (""greens"") vary substantially by interest in PETs. ""Engaged"" and ""aspiring"" greens are attracted to all three PETs, while ""low-tech"" greens report mild interest in green electricity only. Non-green ""techies"" only report interest in solar panels, while ""traditionalists"" report uniformly low PET interest.

To avoid reductionist generalizations, the study takes into account several market-related situations - considering three types of products and two types of services, and investigates also the differences between the customer loyalty profile in two European Union countries with a different level of economic development: France and Romania. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected and analyzed in three main phases: first, secondary data have been analyzed to identify and formulate the research framework; second, a series of focus groups have been conducted with French and Romanian consumers; and third, 500 questionnaires have been applied in each of the two investigated countries. Findings: The findings demonstrate the significant effect of the life-stage model, the Millennials and Generation X consumers included in similar life-stage groups displaying a highly similar pattern of brand loyalty behavior, and close preferences regarding the elements used for brand evaluation. On the other hand, the findings show important variations induced by the market-related situations, and by the different level of economic development of the two investigated countries. Practical implications: The findings of this study demonstrate the complexity of the brand loyalty effect and provide valuable insights into the brand loyalty behavior of five consumer groups both for academics and marketers. Originality/value: This study demonstrates that the effect of consumer life-stage on the brand loyalty behavior of various consumer groups is stronger than the inter-generational effect.

Researchers have begun moving from descriptive studies of this phenomenon to attempts to explain some of its causal mechanisms. One possible explanation is that such behavior may serve as a way of self-medicating depression and negative affect for compulsive buyers. This study examines reported mood states prior to and during shopping for 24 compulsive buyers and a matched comparison group. The findings indicated that relative to the comparison group, the compulsive buyers reported feeling most of the mood states more frequently prior to going shopping, especially the more negative moods. Compulsive buyers also more frequently experienced extreme moods (both positive and negative), while shopping than did the comparison group. When within-subject differences were examined for preshopping and shopping moods, compulsive buyers were more likely to move from negative to positive moods, whereas the opposite was true for the comparison group. The findings suggest that compulsive buyers may be using buying behavior to manage undesirable mood states. © 1996 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0039926232"

It is proposed that consumers reaffirm their autonomy by choosing rewards that are congruent with the promoted consumption effort (choosing reward x over reward y, given effort x). Such congruity allows consumers to construe their behavior as intrinsically motivated rather than externally induced, because the effort is its own reward. Supporting this conceptualization, the results indicate that preferences for effort-congruent rewards are attenuated among consumers with lower psychological reactance, after a reactance-reduction manipulation, when rewards are independent of personal effort, and when rewards are a by-product rather than the intention of effort. © 2005 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-17044379026"

While recent literature introduced a more comprehensive typology encompassing nine functional and eight psychological barriers driving active innovation resistance, an empirical validation of this framework is still missing. In order to close this research gap, we employed a two-study design. First, we conducted a qualitative study to empirically evaluate whether the typology including 17 adoption barriers encompasses all possible negative, product driven reactions of consumers within new product evaluations. Second, we used a quantitative large-scale study to assess the relative importance of each single product-specific adoption barrier within new product evaluations in the context of product and mobile service innovation. Both studies confirm that innovations are commonly rejected owing to these 17 product-specific adoption barriers. However, our results also highlight that functional and psychological barriers vary in their effect on adoption intention depending on whether a new product or service gets evaluated. This study provides first empirical evidence in favor of applying a more comprehensive typology of product-specific barriers when assessing effects of active innovation resistance on consumers’ adoption behavior in future research. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Active innovation resistance; Functional barriers; Innovation rejection; New product adoption; Psychological barriers","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85039053472"

This model was then tested using a quantitative survey of 682 shoppers in popular Vietnamese electrical appliance stores. Findings: Analysis using structural equation modelling reveals that consumers with greater adherence to collectivism and LTO tend to engage in green purchase behaviour owing to their positive environmental attitudes, strong subjective norms and tolerance of inconvenience associated with eco-friendly product purchase. Gender is found to moderate the relationship between the determinants and purchase intention. Practical implications: Marketers including manufacturers and policymakers must endeavour (change globally) to reduce or eliminate perceived inconvenience associated with green purchases. They should also effectively communicate messages stressing that eco-friendly product purchases are crucial for environmental protection and benefit consumer groups including family, peers and society in the long-run.

Defaults can be a preferred form of decision architecture; that is, other nonconscious influences on choice and an absence of established preferences can mean that active choice is not always the better alternative. The authors propose ""smart defaults"" as welfare-enhancing and market-oriented alternatives to the current practice of generally ignoring default effects. Their analysis highlights the importance of considering the process as well as the outcomes of consumer decision making and taking responsibility for consumers' mistakes arising from misuse of defaults.

The managers of online group-buying firms seek to increase customer purchasing intentions in the face of competition. Online group-buying refers to a certain number of consumers who join together as a group via Internet, for the purpose of buying a certain product with a discount. This study explores antecedents of intention to participate in online group-buying and the relationship between intention and behavior. The research model is basaed on planned behavior theory, electronic word-of-mouth, network embeddedness, and website quality attitude. An online survey is administered to 373 registered members of the ihergo website. Data is analyzed using the partial least squares method, and analytical results demonstrate that for potential consumers, experiential electronic word-of-mouth, relational embeddedness of the initiator, and service quality attitude influence intention to engage in online group-buying; for current consumers, intention to attend online group-buying is determined by the structural and relational embeddedness of the initiator, system quality attitude positively affects intention, and intention positively affects online group-buying behavior. This study proposes a new classification of electronic word-of-mouth and applies the perspective of network embeddedness to explore antecedents of intention in online group-buying, broadening the applicability of electronic word-of-mouth and embeddedness theory.

Then the basic concept of BWS is described, followed by how to use the BW method to explore how Australian and Israeli consumers choose wine in a retail store. The paper demonstrates the design of the questionnaire as well as the steps to analyze and present the results. Findings – The BWS approach can be easily implemented for research in wine business especially for multicultural comparisons as it avoids scale confounds. After transformation of the best and worst scores of each respondent for each attribute, the data can be analyzed directly using various statistical methods and can be expressed as choice probabilities. Research limitations/implications – The advantage of BWS is its ability to compare attributes using B−W and B/W scores. The BW method provides a better discrimination of the attributes analyzed. Practical implications – The simplicity of the analysis and graphical presentation makes a significant contribution to practitioners as the B−W counts and probabilities of attributes are easy to obtain and understand.

We develop an integrative conceptual framework that links marketing actions to online consumer activity metrics along the consumer’s path to purchase (P2P). Our framework proposes that the path to purchase has three basic stages–learning (cognitive), feeling (affective), behavior (conative)—and that these can be measured with novel online consumer activity metrics such as clicking on a paid search ads (cognitive) or Facebook likes and unlikes of the brand (affective). Our empirical analysis of a fast moving consumer good supports a know–feel–do pathway for the low–involvement product studied. We find, for example, that earned media can drive sales. However, we find that the news is not all good as it relates to online consumer activity: higher consumer activity on earned and owned media can lead to consumer disengagement in the form of unlikes. While traditional marketing such as distribution (60%) and price (20%) are the main drivers of sales variation for the studied brand, online owned (10%), (un)earned (3%), and paid (2%) media explain a substantial part of the path to purchase. It is noteworthy that TV advertising (5%) explains significantly less than online media in our case. Overall, our study should help strengthen marketers’ case for building share in consumers’ hearts and minds, as measured through consumer online activity and engagement. © 2015, Academy of Marketing Science.","Advertising; FMCG; Paid, owned, and earned media; Path to purchase; VAR","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84924672304"

But research carried out in this field is rather limited to the domain of family medicine. This article describes preferences for 13 different health professions: surgeons, neurologists, anaesthetists, internists, general practitioners, psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, hospital and district nurses, home helps, gynaecologists and midwives. Our investigation also concerns the reasons for people's preferences. In February 1993 a self-administered survey was completed and returned by 961 out of 1113 (response 86%) participants of the Dutch Health Care Consumers Panel, a panel resulting from a random sample of Dutch households. On a range of different health professions a varying minority of patients prefer a care provider of a particular gender. There are virtually no sex preferences for the more 'instrumental' health professions (e.g. surgeons, anaesthetists). Gender preferences are stronger for those health professions more likely engaged in intimate and psychosocial health problems (e.g. gynaecologists and GPs). Preferences expressed do not relate to sex stereotypes of gender differences in instrumentality, expertise, efficiency, consultation length, and personal interest. The majority of persons who prefer female health professionals indicate that they talk more easily to females than to males, and feel more at ease during (internal) examination by females than by males. Persons who prefer male health professionals use the same reasons in favour of males. The discussion relates to gender differences in the communication style of male and female physicians.","Gender; Health professions; Patient preference","Choice Behavior; Communication; Consumer Satisfaction; Female; Humans; Male; Netherlands; Physician-Patient Relations; Stereotyping; anesthesist; article; clinical examination; gender; general practitioner; gynecology; home care; human; human relation; interpersonal communication; midwife; neurology; nurse; patient attitude; physician; psychiatrist; psychologist; social worker; surgeon","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-0031002801"

However, we lack empirical data on the extent to which the concept of individual responsibility for health is accepted by various groups in our society and such data is essential before effective strategies for health education can be implemented. It is argued that readiness to accept responsibility for one's health depends partly on the views held about the aetiology of illness, and this proposition is explored using material on causation and the circumstances where blame is attributed, derived from semi-structured interviews with a sample of 41 working class mothers (Socio-economic Group 9). Roughly half the sample held fatalistic views on the aetiology of illness and thought they were only morally accountable in very restricted circumstances. These women tended to be less well-educated than the rest of the group and they were less likely to be buying their own homes. The results are discussed in relation to current health education policies, consultation behaviours in primary medical care and consumer attitudes to the services provided by their doctors. © 1982.","","Adult; Attitude to Health; Disease; Female; Health; Health Education; Health Status; Human; Life Style; Preventive Medicine; Questionnaires; Socioeconomic Factors; Wales; etiology; geographic distribution; health status; normal human; pregnancy; psychological aspect; responsibility; short survey; united kingdom; working mother","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0020074485"

Results were gathered through an online survey of 2518 nationally representative Australians. The results indicate that the Australian public's knowledge of bioplastics is low, but perception, particularly of biodegradable plastics, is positive. Biodegradable plastics were perceived as better for the environment than ‘normal plastics’ and even ‘easily recyclable’ plastics. The majority of respondents (58%) said they were unsure whether biodegradable plastics can have negative environmental impacts. Sixty-eight percent of people say they would like to see more of the plastic items they use be biodegradable. If this becomes the case, there will be an increased stream of bioplastics entering the recycling system with 62% of people saying they would dispose of bioplastic items in the recycling bin. In light of the results presented in this work, potential issues relating to the introduction of bioplastics are raised and the role that governments and local councils can play in driving the development of the standards, labelling and waste management options that will need to be introduced alongside the introduction of wider bioplastic materials use are discussed. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Biobased plastic; Biodegradable packaging; Biodegradable plastic; Consumer attitude; Environmental issues; Survey","Australia; Bins; Elastomers; Environmental impact; Plastic products; Plastic recycling; Reinforced plastics; Surveying; Surveys; Waste management; biodegradable plastic; Bio-based; Biodegradable packaging; Biodegradable plastics; Consumer attitudes; Environmental issues; consumption behavior; environmental issue; knowledge; perception; plastic; public attitude; survey; Article; consumer attitude; environmental impact; knowledge; nonhuman; perception; recycling; sea pollution; waste management; Biodegradable polymers","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85071990110"

However, the increased marketing of genetically engineered food products and the considerable concern that consumers seem to express with regard to the technology call for the development of a theoretical basis for research into these issues. The aim of this article is to present three models which the authors have developed to explain consumer attitudes, buying behaviour, and attitude change with regard to genetically engineered food products. All three models build on established consumer behaviour theory and on existing and comparable research in the field. Consumer attitudes toward genetic engineering in food products are explained in an attitude model that builds on Fishbein's multi-attribute attitude model but deviates from Fishbein's model in a number of ways. Consumer buying behaviour with regard to specific genetically engineered food products is explained in a behavioural intention model which uses Ajzen's Theory of Planned Behavior as its point of departure. How consumers' attitudes towards genetically engineered food products are affected by various information strategies, finally, is explained in an attitude change model which integrates aspects of the Elaboration Likelihood Model and Social Judgment Theory. The model specifically takes into account the impact of source credibility and various informational factors, such as persuasive content of the information provided, on attitudes. © 1998 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","","","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-54649085028"

An online questionnaire was fielded among students from three major universities in the USA, as well as SNSs (Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter). The final sample (n=259) was comprised of female students who had used social media and television during the past month. The authors developed two structural equation models using Amos 18 statistical software. The analysis indicated that Ducoffe's Ad Value model does not provide a good fit for assessing advertising value in social media or television. While Irritation was a factor in assessing Attitude toward advertising, the respondents assessed ad value on the basis of Entertainment (higher for social media) and Informativeness (higher for television). In examining the relative importance of each component of Ducoffe's model, it is clear that Entertainment and Informativeness play key roles in assessing advertising value for both traditional (television) and non-traditional media (SNSs). While Irritation did not play a significant role in value assessment, it was found to directly impact attitude towards advertising, a critical juncture in the consumer purchase cycle. If practitioners seek to interact via SNSs with young female consumers they should focus on providing entertaining content in a format that makes brand engagement seamless while not impeding goals. This initial investigation provides the impetus for future research about consumers' perceptions of advertising value across all SNSs, in comparison to their traditional counterparts. © 2012, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Ad value; Consumer behaviour; Ducoffe's Advertising Value; Entertainment; Informativeness; Irritation; Social media; Social networking sites; Students; Television; United States of America; Women","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84866851932"

Satisfaction with online learning is a significant aspect of promoting successful educational processes. This study aimed to identify factors affecting student and faculty satisfaction with online learning during the new normal. Online questionnaires were emailed to students (n = 370) and faculty (n = 81) involved in online learning during the pandemic. The questionnaires included closed- and open-ended questions and were organised into two parts: socio-demographic information and satisfaction with online learning. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse the responses to the satisfaction scales. Students’ and faculty responses to the open-ended questions were analysed using the thematic analysis method. The response rate was 97.8% for students and 86.4% for faculty. Overall satisfaction among students was 41.3% compared to 74.3% for faculty. The highest areas of satisfaction for students were communication and flexibility, whereas 92.9% of faculty were satisfied with students’ enthusiasm for online learning. Technical problems led to reduced student satisfaction, while faculty were hampered by the higher workload and the required time to prepare the teaching and assessment materials. Study-load and workload, enhancing engagement, and technical issues (SWEET) were the themes that emerged from the thematic analysis as affecting student and faculty satisfaction. Adopting a combination synchronous and asynchronous approach, incorporating different applications to engage students, and timely feedback are imperative to increasing student satisfaction, while institutional support and organisational policy could enhance faculty satisfaction. © 2021 The Author(s).

Thus, we construct a conceptual framework that grounds consumer attention within a larger progression of behavioral responses to eWOM. We then conduct an experiment (n = 28) that isolates contextual antecedents of attention to positive, negative, and neutral WOM for both luxury and non-luxury brands within a social media platform. Using behavioral eye-tracking, we find that WOM message valence interacts with brand type to affect attention differently.

These results are not driven by firms being less productive, having expanded too much prior to the Great Recession, or being generally more sensitive to fluctuations in either aggregate employment or house prices. Likewise, at the county level, we find that counties with more highly levered firms experienced significantly larger declines in employment in response to local consumer demand shocks. Accordingly, firms' balance sheets also matter for aggregate employment.

Consciousness was operationalized by weighting personal beliefs with the importance attached by consumers to sustainability dimensions. Four separate tests of the CSC scale indicated an appropriate psychometric quality of the scale and provided support for this new measurement approach that incorporates the environmental, social and economic dimensions of sustainability. © 2013, Academy of Marketing Science.","Consciousness for sustainable consumption; Scale development; Sustainability","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84959313140"

Design/methodology/approach: The authors adopted an ""eagle eye"" method to investigate this phenomenon: Where attempts were made to frame general principles and observations; alongside a swooping view of key anecdotal observations - in order to ground and enrich the study. The authors participated in an iterative process when analysing longitudinal and contemporary phenomenological data, in order to arrive at a consensus. This was grounded in: triangulating individual and collective researcher findings; critiquing relevant published material; and reflecting upon known reviewed manuscripts submitted to marketing publications - both successful and unsuccessful. Findings: The authors assert that a key milestone in the study and practice of marketing, branding, consumer behaviour and consumption in connection with Islam and Muslims is the emergence of research wherein the terms ""Islamic marketing"" and ""Islamic branding"" have evolved - of which JIMA is also a by-product. Some have construed Islam marketing/branding as merely a niche area. Given the size of Muslim populations globally and the critical importance of understanding Islam in the context of business and practices with local, regional and international ramifications, scholarship on Islamic marketing has become essential. Western commerce and scholarship has been conducted to a limited extent, and some evidence exists that research is occurring globally. The authors believe it is vital for ""Islamic marketing"" scholarship to move beyond simply raising the flag of ""Brand Islam"" and the consideration of Muslim geographies to a point where Islam - as a way of life, a system of beliefs and practices, and religious and social imperatives - is amply explored. Research limitations/implications: An ""eagle eye"" view has been taken, which balances big picture and grassroots conceptual findings. The topic is complex - and so while diverse expert opinions are cited, coverage of many issues is necessarily brief, due to space constraints. Practical implications: Scholars and practitioners alike should find the thoughts contained in the paper of significant interest. Ultimately, scholarship of Islam's influences on marketing theory and practice should lead to results which have pragmatic implications, just as research on Islamic banking and finance has. Originality/value: The paper appears to be the first to bring together such a diverse set of expert opinions within one body of work, and one that provides a forum for experts to reflect and comment on peers' views, through iteration. Also the term Crescent marketing is introduced to highlight how critical cultural factors are, which shape perceptions and Islamic practises. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Culture theory; Halal; Hip hop; Indonesia; Islamic marketing and branding; Malaysia; Marketing; Marketing theory and practice; Middle East; Muslim consumer behaviour; Muslim youth; Nation branding","","Review","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84878214135"

All studies of consumer heterogeneity focus on a specific category of products and ignore the fact that the purchase behavior of panel households is often observed simultaneously in multiple categories. If sensitivity to marketing mix variables is a common consumer trait, then one should expect to see similarities in sensitivity across multiple categories. The goal in this paper is to measure the covariance of both observed (linked to measured characteristics of households) and unobserved heterogeneity in marketing mix sensitivity across multiple categories. Measurement of correlation in sensitivities across categories will serve to guide the interpretation of the literature on household heterogeneity. If there is a large correlation, one can be more confident that sensitivity to marketing variables is a fundamental household property and not simply a category-specific anomaly. Detection of correlation in sensitivities across categories requires an appropriate methodology that can handle the high dimensional covariance structures and properly account for uncertainty in estimation. For example, a simple approach might be to fit a brand choice model to each of the available categories in turn, ignoring the data in the other categories. For each category, household parameter estimates could be obtained for the parameters corresponding to price, display, and feature sensitivity. These parameter estimates could be viewed as data and the correlations across categories could be computed. Such a procedure could induce a downward bias in the estimation of correlation due to the independent sampling errors, which are present in each parameter estimate. We develop a hierarchical model structure that introduces an explicit correlation structure across categories and utilizes the data in multiple categories at the same time. To reduce the size of the covariance matrix, we use a variance components approach. We introduce household-specific demographic variables to decompose the correlation across categories into that which can be ascribed to observable and unobservable sources. Shopping behavior variables such as shopping frequency and market basket size as well as intensity of shopping in a category are also included in the model. Using data on five categories, we find substantial and statistically important correlations ranging from .32 for price sensitivities to .58 for feature sensitivity. These correlations are much larger than the correlations obtained with the state-of-the-art techniques available prior to our work. We attribute our ability to detect substantial correlations to our method, which involves the joint use of multiple category data in a parsimonious and efficient manner. Unlike previous studies with panel data, household demographic variables are found to be strongly related to price sensitivity. Higher income households are less price sensitive and large families are more price sensitive. Shopping behavior variables are also important in explaining price sensitivity. Households that visit the store often are more price sensitive. Households with larger market baskets are less price sensitive, confirming the view of Bell and Lattin (1998). Heavy user households tend to be both less price sensitive and less display sensitive. The evidence presented here of substantial correlations validates, in part, the notion that sensitivity to marketing mix variables is a consumer trait and is not unique to specific product categories. It also opens the possibility of using information across categories in making inferences about consumer brand preference and marketing mix sensitivity, providing a richer source of information for target marketing.","Bayesian methods; Choice models; Multiple categories; Parameter correlations","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0032220741"

Specifically, the research aims to establish the role of situational factors in the process of adoption. Design/methodology/approach - A two-step research process is employed. First, exploratory qualitative research is carried out, with the purpose of gaining an in-depth understanding of consumers' online grocery shopping behaviour. This is followed by a large-scale quantitative survey extending the findings of the qualitative research and validating the role of situational factors in instigating the commencement (and discontinuation) of online grocery buying. Cluster analysis is used to segment consumers based on the importance of specific types of situations. Findings - Both qualitative and quantitative results establish the importance of situational factors, such as having a baby or developing health problems, as triggers for starting to buy groceries online. Many shoppers are found to discontinue online grocery shopping once the initial trigger has disappeared or they have experienced a problem with the service. Practical implications - While situational factors are beyond a marketer's control, they could be used as a basis for marketing communications content and target advertising, for instance, by using magazines directed at new parents. Originality/value - The importance of situational factors as triggers for the adoption of online grocery shopping suggests an erratic adoption process, driven by circumstances rather than by a cognitive elaboration and decision.

There has been less research however, investigating whether this bias is related to specific categories of end use and/or specific types of socio-demographic and socio-psychological household profiles. A high resolution smart metering study producing a detailed end use event registry as well as psycho-social and socio-demographic surveys, stock inventory audits and selfreported water diaries was completed for 252 households located in South-east Queensland, Australia. The study examined the contributions of end uses to total water use for each group that self-identified as ""low"", ""medium"" or ""high"" water users. A series of univariate tests (i.e. analysis of variance) were conducted to examine a range of variables that characterise each self-identified water usage group including age, income, percentage of water efficient stock (e.g. low-flow taps), family size and composition and water conservation intentions and attitudes. The level of information consumers receive on their water bill as well as the diurnal end use patterns were also examined. The paper concludes with a discussion of the general characteristics (i.e. income, age, gender and family composition) of groups that tended to overestimate or underestimate their water use and how this knowledge can be used to inform demand management policy such as targeted community education programmes and community-based social marketing. Further, the potential for positive economic and sustainable development outcomes from this research is also discussed. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Three types of dining experiences were examined: positive and negative customer experiences and negative customer service followed by a satisfactory recovery package. Design/methodology/approach: A survey was adopted to test the factors posited to influence Generation Y consumers in these service contexts. Participants were recruited through Amazon Mechanical Turk , and multi-group structural equation modeling was performed to analyze the data. Findings: Active use of social media and peer influence had a sweeping influence on Generation Y’s intentions to engage in eWOM about their service experiences. Technological sophistication with mobile technology influenced Generation Y to spread positive or negative service experiences, rather than satisfactory recovery experiences. Family influence had a mixed influence on Generation Y subgroups (21-24 years old vs 25-35 years old) to engage in eWOM about their satisfactory or poor service experiences. In satisfactory recovery experiences, family influence showed no significant influence on Generation Y’s eWOM behaviors. Research limitations/implications: This study enriches online reviews and eWOM marketing theories, adds to service failure and recovery literature and enhances understanding of consumer behavior expressed by Generation Y through the empirical investigation of Generation Y consumers’ behavioral motivations to engage in eWOM through social media and mobile technology. Practical implications: Engaging Generation Y consumers with social media campaigns and mobile technology development is not merely sufficient in eWOM marketing strategies. Instead, it is essential to create integrative peer communities to motivate Generation Y consumers to engage in eWOM marketing. Marketers need to pay attention to the mixed effects of family influences on the eWOM behaviors of subgroups of Generation Y in positive or negative service experiences. Originality/value: Given the scarcity of consumer behavior research into Generation Y as an emerging market segment, this paper makes an incremental contribution by developing and validating a model of factors that influence Generation Y consumers’ eWOM intentions through social networking and mobile technologies in three major service contexts: positive, negative and recovery following a service failure. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","eWOM; Generation Y; Mobile technology; Service failure; Service recovery; Social media","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85014048174"

Under DA, the retailer displays all available units so that each arriving customer has perfect information about the actual inventory level. Under DO, the retailer displays only one unit at a time so that each customer knows about product availability but not the actual inventory level. Recent research suggests that when faced with strategic consumers, the retailer could increase expected profits by making an upfront commitment to a price path. We focus on such pricing strategies in this paper, and study the potential benefit of DO compared to DA, and its effectiveness in mitigating the adverse impact of strategic consumer behavior. We find support for our hypothesis that the DO format could potentially create an increased sense of shortage risk, and hence it is better than the DA format. However, although potentially beneficial, a move from DA to DO is typically very far from eliminating the adverse impact of strategic consumer behavior. We observe that, generally, it is not important for a retailer to modify the level of inventory when moving from a DA to a DO format; a change in the display format, along with an appropriate price modification, is typically sufficient. Interestingly, across all scenarios in which a change in inventory is significantly beneficial, we observed that only one of the following two actions takes place: either the premium price is increased along with a reduction in inventory, or inventory is increased along with premium price reduction. We find that the marginal benefit of DO can vary dramatically as a function of the per-unit cost to the retailer. In particular, when the retailer's per-unit cost is relatively high, but not too high to make sales unprofitable or to justify exclusive sales to high-valuation customers only, the benefits of DO appear to be at their highest level, and could reach up to 20% increase in profit. Finally, we demonstrate that by moving from DA to DO, while keeping the price path unchanged, the volatility of the retailer's profit decreases. © 2009 INFORMS.","Dynamic pricing; Game-theory applications; Inventory display; Marketing-operations interface; Retailing; Revenue management; Strategic customers","Costs; Customer satisfaction; Dissolved oxygen sensors; Economics; Game theory; Management; Risk perception; Dynamic pricing; Game-theory applications; Inventory display; Retailing; Revenue management; Strategic customers; Sales","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-69049095164"

This study is the first in the RFID literature to use the TAM for explaining consumer acceptance of RFID technology. The findings suggest that: 1) higher perceived convenience of RFID technology leads to greater acceptance of this technology; 2) societal beliefs, value systems, norms, and/or behaviors influence the extent of consumer acceptance of RFID technology; and 3) higher perceived importance of and less willingness to sacrifice personal information security lead to lower intention to use RFID technology.

Game-elements can easily be embedded within product advertisements, but little is known about the success factors of this technology. We investigated which motivational incentives of game designs influence the purchase intentions of consumers. The theory of planned behavior (Ajzen, 1991) was expected to explain purchase intentions for non-gamified sports products, whereas the modified technology acceptance model (Herzig et al., 2012) was expected to predict purchase intentions of gamified sports products.; Design/methodology/approach – Participants were 101 consumers who performed sports on a regular basis. Age and prior experience with digital games were assumed to influence the effectiveness of gamification.; Findings – Purchase intentions of conventional products were predicted by attitudes, subjective norm and perceived control, whereas purchase intentions of gamified products were predicted by attitudes and the perceived usefulness. Enjoyment and flow were significant mediators between motivational incentives and purchase intentions. Consumers with prior gaming experience had higher purchase intentions for gamified products.; Practical implications – Gamify products for younger target groups with gaming experience; use intrinsic and extrinsic motivational incentives; focus on enjoyment, flow and the perceived usefulness.; Social implications – Game-elements in sports advertisements might also be suitable for public health campaigns. They may motivate people be more physically active and lead a healthier lifestyle.; Originality/value – This study specifies predictors for purchase intentions of gamified products and emphasizes the importance of flow and enjoyment as mediators. Age differences indicate that young consumers had higher intentions to purchase the gamified product, judged it as more useful and perceived more flow and enjoyment than the older age group. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Advertising; Flow; Gamification; Intrinsic motivation; Purchase intentions","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84916244407"

Little research is directly devoted to personality Issues, and if consumer personality is investigated at all, it tends to be from the narrow perspective of developing yet another Individual difference measure in an already crowded field of personality scales or considering the moderating effects of a given trait on some relationship of Interest. Understanding the individual person in his or her role as a consumer should be a key Issue in the study of consumer behavior, but in order to realize this vision the scope of personality research has to be broadened. In this essay I discuss recent work in personality psychology that may serve as the foundation for the development of a personology of the consumer, in which people are seen as dispositional, goal-striving, and narrative entities engaged in consumption In the broadest sense.","","","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0036377395"
