Because close elections are related to economic downturns, I find that the effect of close elections on investment is understated by more than half by ordinary least squares (OLS).

From a conceptual perspective, such health and economic threats can severely disrupt consumers’ sense of ontological security and elicit adaptive responses by both consumers and marketers. Given the opportune timing, this issue of the Journal of Consumer Research is focused on articles that address questions of consumers’ responses to external threats. The purpose of this introduction is to provide an organizing “conceptual tapestry” to connect the articles appearing in the issue. This framework is provided as a tool to help researchers structure their particular projects within the broader landscape of consumer threat response and to present some potential directions for future research. In conjunction with these articles, we hope that this conceptual framework will provide a point of departure for researchers seeking to enhance the understanding of how consumers and markets collectively respond over the short term and long term to threats that disrupt consumers’ routines, lives, or even the fabric of society. © The Author(s) 2020.

Using age as a proxy for managers' investment experience, we find that around the peak of the technology bubble, mutual funds run by younger managers are more heavily invested in technology stocks, relative to their style benchmarks, than their older colleagues. Furthermore, young managers, but not old managers, exhibit trend-chasing behavior in their technology stock investments. As a result, young managers increase their technology holdings during the run-up, and decrease them during the downturn. Both results are in line with the behavior of inexperienced investors in experimental asset markets. The economic significance of young managers' actions is amplified by large inflows into their funds prior to the peak in technology stock prices. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Second, the aforementioned relationship is also highly economic event-dependent, as it is influenced by the Great Recession of 2007 and the ongoing Eurozone debt crisis that began in 2010.

There has been extensive research on the linkage between transport infrastructure and economic performance since the late 1980s, characterised by widely varying evidence. We conduct a meta-analysis of the empirical evidence on the output elasticity of transport infrastructure, based on a sample of 563 estimates obtained from 33 studies. Previous meta-analyses have focused on total public capital and hence cannot appropriately explain the wide variation in the productivity effect of transport infrastructure nor provide guidance to policymakers on the returns to investment in different types of transport infrastructure. Our results indicate that the existing estimates of the productivity effect of transport infrastructure can vary across main industry groups, tend to be higher for the US economy than for European countries, and are higher for roads compared to other modes of transport. The variation in the estimates of the output elasticity of transport is also explained by differences in the methods and data used in previous studies. Failing to control for unobserved heterogeneity and spurious associations tends to result in higher values, while failing to control for urbanisation and congestion levels leads to omitted variable bias. These findings can be used to inform future research on the choice of model specification and estimation and transport-related policy making. © 2013 The Authors.","Economic performance; Meta-analysis; Transport infrastructure","Europe; United States; capital formation; decision making; economic growth; estimation method; future prospect; investment location; meta-analysis; model test; planning method; research work; transportation infrastructure; transportation mode; transportation policy","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84879514391"

This article formally addresses the link between private-label success and economic expansions and contractions using recently developed time-series/econometric techniques. The findings confirm conventional wisdom that a country's privatelabel share increases when the economy is suffering and shrinks when the economy is flourishing. However, asymmetries are found in the extent to and speed with which private-label share changes in cyclical up- versus downturns. Consumers switch more extensively to store brands during bad economic times than they switch back to national brands in a subsequent recovery. In addition, the switch to private-label brands is faster than the opposite movement to national brands after the recession ends. Finally, not only are consumers more prone to buy private labels during economic downturns, but some keep buying them when bad economic times are long over as well, leaving permanent ""scars"" on national brands' performance level. The authors argue that national-brand manufacturers can mitigate the effect of an economic downturn on their shares by intensifying their marketingsupport activities in recessions. Such a proactive strategy is not often observed. On the contrary, available evidence suggests that many manufacturers exacerbate their predicament by cutting back on their marketing expenses when the economy turns sour. Most retailers invest more strongly in their private-label program when the economy deteriorates, making it even more difficult for national brands to catch up with the share lost during contractions. © 2007, American Marketing Association.","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-34247098270"

Using daily data from 2017 to 2020, we employ tail dependence as copulas and the Generalized Forecast Error Variance Decomposition to examine the volatility connectedness. Our results suggest that, first, portfolios consisting of these assets exhibit heavy-tail dependence which implies that in the times of economic turbulence, there will be a high probability of large joint losses. Second, volatility transmission is higher in the short term, implying that short-term shocks can cause higher volatility in the assets, but in the long run, volatility transmission decreases. Third, Bitcoin and gold are vital assets for hedging, though the Bitcoin is also affected by its past volatility, a feature it shares with green bonds and NASDAQ AI. During economic downturns, gold may act as a safe haven, as its shock transmission to NASDAQ AI is just around 1.41%. Lastly, the total volatility transmission of all financial assets is considerably high, suggesting that the portfolio has an inherent self-transmitting risk which requires careful diversification. The NASDAQ AI and general equity indexes are not good hedging instruments for each other. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","4th industrial revolution; Artificial intelligence; Cryptocurrencies; Green bonds; NASDAQ AI; Portfolio diversification","Artificial intelligence; Bitcoin; Financial markets; Gold; Green manufacturing; Industry 4.0; Transmissions; Economic downturn; Environmental challenges; Forecast Error Variance Decomposition; Hedging instruments; Industrial revolutions; Portfolio diversification; Shock transmission; Volatility transmissions; artificial intelligence; currency; industrial history; robotics; Fintech","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85087855013"

Inadequate modelling of the financial sector meant they were ill-suited for predicting or responding to a financial crisis; and a reliance on representative agent models meant they were ill-suited for analysing either the role of distribution in fluctuations and crises or the consequences of fluctuations on inequality.

Now, as the world struggles to recover, it's tempting to blame what happened on just a few greedy bankers who took irrational risks and left the rest of us to foot the bill. In Fault Lines, Rajan argues that serious flaws in the economy are also to blame, and warns that a potentially more devastating crisis awaits us if they aren't fixed. Rajan shows how the individual choices that collectively brought about the economic meltdown--made by bankers, government officials, and ordinary homeowners--were rational responses to a flawed global financial order in which the incentives to take on risk are incredibly out of step with the dangers those risks pose. He traces the deepening fault lines in a world overly dependent on the indebted American consumer to power global economic growth and stave off global downturns. He exposes a system where America's growing inequality and thin social safety net create tremendous political pressure to encourage easy credit and keep job creation robust, no matter what the consequences to the economy's long-term health; and where the U.S. financial sector, with its skewed incentives, is the critical but unstable link between an overstimulated America and an underconsuming world. In Fault Lines, Rajan demonstrates how unequal access to education and health care in the United States puts us all in deeper financial peril, even as the economic choices of countries like Germany, Japan, and China place an undue burden on America to get its policies right. He outlines the hard choices we need to make to ensure a more stable world economy and restore lasting prosperity. © 2010 by Princeton University Press.

The COVID-19 crisis provides an unprecedented opportunity to investigate this considerably further. Further, whether cryptocurrencies provide a diversification for equities is still an unsettled issue. We employ several econometric procedures, including wavelet coherence, and neural network analyses to rigorously examine the role of COVID-19 on the paired co-movements of four cryptocurrencies, with seven equity indices (matching countries particularly impacted by COVID-19). Our period of study includes one year prior to the onset of COVID-19, and one year during the pandemic, extending deeper into the pandemic period (February 2021) than most previous studies. We find co-movements between cryptocurrencies and equity indices gradually increased as COVID-19 progressed. However, most of these co-movements are either modestly positively correlated, or minimal, suggesting cryptocurrencies in general do not provide a diversification benefit during either normal times or downturns. An exception, however, is the co-movement of tether. Tether co-moves negatively with equities to an economically significant degree, both pre COVID-19, and considerably more during COVID-19. Co-movements between tether and equity indices spiked sharply during identified waves of the pandemic. Tether appears to be an important safe haven during times of market turmoil, consistent with investors seeking USD liquidity during periods of volatility. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Bitcoin; Co-movement; COVID-19; Safe haven; Wavelet","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85104906672"

This in turn reduces corporate value. However, it is still unclear whether corporate financial distress is related to these corporate governance characteristics. To answer this question, we adopt three variables to proxy for corporate governance risk, namely, the percentage of directors occupied by the controlling shareholder, the percentage the controlling shareholders shareholding pledged for bank loans (pledge ratio), and the deviation in control away from the cash flow rights. Binary logistic regressions are then fitted to generate dichotomous prediction models. Taiwanese listed firms, characterised by a high degree of ownership concentration, similar to that in most countries, are used as our empirical samples. The evidence suggests that the three variables mentioned above are positively related to the risk for financial distress in the following year.

We propose a new explanation for the appeal of Proposition 187 to California voters during the 1994 election and offer a new approach to studying the political context in which it gained voter approval. We argue that support for this proposition was an example of cyclical nativism, which was provoked primarily by California's economic downturn during the early 1990s. We also argue that the issue of illegal immigration was politicized during the election by the gubernatorial and senatorial candidates and that this endogeneity must be considered in any analysis of voter support for this proposition. Methods. To test this theory, we develop hypotheses about how nativist attitudes might be reflected in the voting behavior of specific groups based on economic perceptions, race, education, and area of residence. We test these hypotheses using Voter News Service (VNS) exit-poll data from the 1994 California election. We formulate a two-stage probit model to allow for the endogeneity. Results. We find support for our nativist theory and our endogeneity argument in the data. Voters who perceived the economy as poor, perceived themselves as threatened financially by illegal immigrants, or who lived closer to the immigrant source were more likely to support the measure. We also find that voters were relying on candidate endorsements, rather than on party identification or political ideology, in making their vote choice. Conclusions. These findings cause us to conclude, specifically, that nativism, fueled by economic conditions, was a salient factor leading many Californians to support Proposition 187 and, generally, that it is necessary to consider the effects of candidate endorsements on proposition voting.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0040805980"

One of the interesting points of overlap is a renewed interest in notions of austerity with optimistic commentators offering up hope that a (re)turn to frugality represents a unique opportunity for the pursuit of sustainable consumption. Against this backdrop the analysis sets out an approach to frugality as a social practice and drawing on a qualitative study of persons who identified themselves as attempting to reduce their environmental impacts, it considers the links between frugality and sustainable consumption. Crucially, a distinction is drawn between thrift and frugality in relation to: (1) the scale at which they exercise care and compassion; (2) their relationship to the normative expectations of consumer cultures, and; (3) their consequences in terms of environmental impacts. Taking these distinctions alongside historical analyses of changing consumption patterns, a note of caution is offered that the passage from the economic downturn to sustainable consumption may not be as clear as might be hoped. © 2011.","Ethics; Frugality; Recession; Sustainable consumption; Sustainable lifestyles; Thrift","Armeria; climate change; crisis management; economic impact; environmental impact; ethics; financial crisis; nature-society relations; sustainability","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-79960918041"

The brands constantly struggle to secure profits by providing novel value to customers through quality products and services, customer management, retail strategies, and innovative marketing mixes. However, the recent entry of numerous fashion brands in the luxury market coupled with decreased sales related to economic downturns have led to new challenges for luxury firms. Because the luxury fashion business is considered high value-added with guaranteed high profit margins and secure regular customers, the lower sectors have begun to heat up the competition. To survive the recent unforeseen challenges of heated competition, they have turned toward marketing communication using social media. Social media are the two-way communication platforms that allow users to interact with each other online to share information and opinions. Use of social media sites such as Twitter and Facebook has already expanded to almost every luxury fashion brand and been evaluated as business take-off tools. With the increased use of social media as a means of marketing communication for luxury brands, it has become necessary to empirically analyze the effect of social media marketing (SMM). Thus, the study presented here investigated the effects of this SMM on customer relationships (involving intimacy and trust) and purchase intention. A preliminary test was conducted in order to draw a sample of a luxury fashion brand for this study. Self-administrated questionnaires with visual stimuli were used to collect data from luxury consumers in the Seoul area. Respondents were restricted to consumers who had purchased any luxury fashion brand item within the previous two years. Among 150 questionnaires distributed, 133 questionnaires were finally employed for statistical analysis. Principal component analysis using varimax rotation was conducted to figure out the properties of luxury fashion brands’ SMM. The social media contained five properties: entertainment, customization, interaction, word of mouth, and trend. Factor loadings ranged from .84 to .52. Cronbach’s α lay between .80 and .88, demonstrating adequate construct reliability. Multiple regression analysis was conducted to test the effects of SMM on customer relationship (i.e., intimacy and trust) and purchase intention, as well as relationship between customer relationship (i.e., intimacy and trust) and purchase intention. Results show that entertainment has a significant positive effect on intimacy (β=.25, t=3.48, p<.01), trust (β=.34, t=5.75, p<.001), and purchase intention (β=.31, t=4.32, p<.001). Other positive effects are customization on trust (β=.13, t=2.28, p<.05), interaction on purchase intention (β=.25, t=3,54, p<.01), word of mouth on intimacy (β=.14, t=1.92, p<.05) and purchase intention (β=.19, t=2.65, p<.01), and trend only on trust (β=.32, t=5.30, p<.001). It seems that entertainment, customization, and trend were satisfying what customers expected from a luxury fashion brand. Because the luxury industry aims to provide value to customers in every way possible, the brands should focus on providing free entertainment content, customized services, and trend forward social media site which all act positively toward enhancing customer relationship. Trust has a significant relationship with purchase intention (β=.34, t=4.85, p<.001). Since the trust variable within a customer relationship was only significantly associated with purchase intention, the mediating effects of customization and trend were found. The study proves the effectiveness of luxury brands’ SMM on both customer relationships and purchase intention, and proposes a strategy to enhance the brands’ performance by defining specific factors influencing both. The result show that the chosen brand’s SMM includes distinctive elements in comparison to old-fashioned marketing performances. Every property found in luxury brands’ SMM positively influenced customer relationships and purchase intention, with entertainment affecting more variables than any other properties. Luxury brands should heavily supply an entertainment aspect of social media contents and activities. Every activity enabled by use of the media, such as creating relationships with other users, providing customized service and free entertainment contents, and obtaining genuine information on personal interest should all be entertaining. By focusing on providing such features, customer relationships and purchase intention will be enhanced. Concerning the association between customer relationship and purchase intention, trust and purchase intention were highly related. Customers’ trust was strengthened via interaction with other users as well as brand on social media sites. Trust gained while enjoying entertainment and communication provided on the sites seems to contribute greatly toward a luxury brand’s profit. With the growing interest of luxury fashion brands in providing luxurious value to customers in every way possible, using social media appears to be appropriate for retaining old customers and attracting cross-shoppers. As competition among luxury fashion brands becomes more intense by providing plenty of alternatives to customers, the brands’ prosperity seems no longer quite so promising. The importance of managing customers as valuable assets cannot be emphasized more. As such, more luxury brands should engage in social media marketing activities to anticipate a positive contribution to the brands by providing new luxury value to customers. © 2010 KAMS.","Customer relationship; Intimacy; Luxury fashion brand; Purchase intention; Social media marketing; Trust","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84864919519"

It led to a major sovereign debt crisis, which is arguably the biggest challenge for the European Union (EU) and its common currency. Not since the 1950s have advanced democracies experienced such a dramatic external imposition of austerity and structural reform policies through inter- or supranational organisations such as the EU and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) or as implicitly requested by international financial markets. Did this massive interference with the room for maneuver of parliaments and governments in many countries erode support for national democracy in the crisis since 2007? Did citizens realise that their national democratic institutions were no longer able to effectively decide on major economic and social policies, on economic and welfare state institutions? And did they react by concluding that this constrained democracy no longer merited further support? These are the questions guiding this article, which compares 26 EU countries in 2007-2011 and re-analyses 78 national surveys. Aggregate data from these surveys is analysed in a time-series cross-section design to examine changes in democratic support at the country level. The hypotheses also are tested at the individual level by estimating a series of cross-classified multilevel logistic regression models. Support for national democracy - operationalised as satisfaction with the way democracy works and as trust in parliament - declined dramatically during the crisis. This was caused both by international organisations and markets interfering with national democratic procedures and by the deteriorating situation of the national economy as perceived by individual citizens. © 2013 European Consortium for Political Research.","Crisis; Democracy; European Union; External influence; Legitimacy","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84903816046"

Although startling in scope and urgency, the populist wave has been developing in declining regions of wealthy countries for some time. Trade, offshoring, and automation have steadily reduced the number of available jobs and the wages of industrial workers since at least the 1970s. The decline in manufacturing employment initiated the deterioration of social and economic conditions in affected communities, exacerbating inequalities between depressed rural areas and small cities and towns, on the one hand, and thriving cities, on the other. The global financial crisis of 2008 catalyzed these divisions, as communities already in decline suffered deeper and longer economic downturns than metropolitan areas, where superstar knowledge, technology, and service-oriented firms agglomerate. We document many of these trends across the United States and Europe, and demonstrate that populist support is strongest in communities that experienced long-term economic and social decline. Institutional differences in labor markets and electoral rules across developed democracies may explain some of the variation in populists' electoral success. Renewed support for the Liberal International Order may require a rejuvenation of distressed communities and a reduction of stark regional inequalities. © The IO Foundation 2021.","globalization backlash; liberal international order; Populism","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85100752462"

A recent work [Dijkstra, L., Garcilazo, E. & McCann, P. (2013) The economic performance of European cities and city regions: Myths and realities, European Planning Studies, 21(3), pp. 334–354] claims that second-rank cities have in fact outperformed first-rank cities, becoming the main driving forces in national economic performance. In the debate that emphasizes the role of second-rank cities in national growth, a simplified view of the role of agglomeration economies is provided; they are taken for granted in small- and medium-sized cities and only in large cities will the problem of a downturn in urban returns to scale emerge. In this paper, a more complex view is assumed, claiming that the oversimplified interpretation that urban economic performance simply depends on the exploitation of agglomeration economies and that these agglomeration economies merely depend on urban size alone should be abandoned. Some already existing theoretical frameworks in urban economics can help in recalling the role of possible bifurcations in the development path of cities, linked to the capability to attract or develop new and higher-order functions, increase internal efficiency and reach scale economies through cooperation networks with other cities (the city-network theory). All these elements work as conditions for fully exploiting agglomeration economies and ways to overcome urban decreasing returns. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84927699220"

And, in much the same way, tourism aficionados, policy makers and communities are asking a similar question—what will the tourism landscape, and indeed the world, look like after the pandemic? As casualties from the crisis continue to fall by the wayside, the rethinking about what an emergent tourism industry might resemble is on in earnest. Many are hopeful that this wake-up call event is an opportunity to reshape tourism into a model that is more sustainable, inclusive and caring of the many stakeholders that rely on it. And some indicators, though not all, point in that direction. In line with this, the concept of ‘human flourishing’ offers merits as an alternative touchstone for evaluating the impacts of tourism on host communities. Human flourishing has a long genesis and its contemporary manifestation, pushed by COVID-19 and applied to travel and tourism, further expands the bounds of its application. Human flourishing has the potential to offer more nuanced sets of approaches by which the impact of tourism on host communities might be measured. The challenge remaining is how to develop robust indices to calibrate human flourishing policy successes. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","COVID-19; host community; Human flourishing; sustainable tourism indicators; tourism impacts","COVID-19; ecotourism; Great Depression; stakeholder; viral disease","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85085489296"

To avoid below-par performance, firms need to adapt quickly to this significant change in their environment, making real options very valuable to them. Although firms' international investments can potentially provide such flexibility, this issue has not been empirically examined in a context of such dramatic negative change. We consider two types of international investments by firms in this regard, foreign direct investments and export-related international investments, developing two measures that directly assess the flexibility derived from each that are new to the literature. Based on these measures, we find evidence that both types of international investments provided valuable flexibility for Korean firms during the economic crisis conditions. This study contributes to the literature by showing that firms with real options investments in place have a greater ability to flexibly adapt their overall operations in line with unforeseen negative environmental change, in contrast to firms without such investments.

These parents struggle with how to handle children's consumer wants, which continue unabated despite the economic downturn. And, indeed, parents and other adults continue to spend billions of dollars on children every year. Why do children seem to desire so much, so often, so soon, and why do parents capitulate so readily? To determine what forces lie behind the onslaught of Nintendo Wiis and Bratz dolls, Allison J. Pugh spent three years observing and interviewing children and their families. In Longing and Belonging: Parents, Children, and Consumer Culture, Pugh teases out the complex factors that contribute to how we buy, from lunchroom conversations about Game Boys to the stark inequalities facing American children. Pugh finds that children's desires stem less from striving for status or falling victim to advertising than from their yearning to join the conversation at school or in the neighborhood. Most parents respond to children's need to belong by buying the particular goods and experiences that act as passports in children's social worlds, because they sympathize with their children's fear of being different from their peers. Even under financial constraints, families prioritize children ""feeling normal"". Pugh masterfully illuminates the surprising similarities in the fears and hopes of parents and children from vastly different social contexts, showing that while corporate marketing and materialism play a part in the commodification of childhood, at the heart of the matter is the desire to belong. © 2009 by The Regents of the University of California.

On the one hand, the empirical growth literature finds a positive effect of financial depth as measured by, for instance, private domestic credit and liquid liabilities (e.g., Levine, Loayza, and Beck 2000). On the other hand, the banking and currency crisis literature finds that monetary aggregates, such as domestic credit, are among the best predictors of crises and their related economic downturns (e.g., Kaminsky and Reinhart 1999). The paper accounts for these contrasting effects based on the distinction between the short- and long-run impacts of financial intermediation. Working with a panel of cross-country and time-series observations, the paper estimates an encompassing model of short- and long-run effects using the Pooled Mean Group estimator developed by Pesaran, Shin, and Smith (1999). The conclusion from this analysis is that a positive long-run relationship between financial intermediation and output growth co-exists with a mostly negative short-run relationship. The paper further develops an explanation for these contrasting effects by relating them to recent theoretical models by linking the estimated short-run effects to measures of financial fragility (namely, banking crises and financial volatility) and by jointly analyzing the effects of financial depth and fragility in classic panel growth regressions.

In the context of significant economic, social and environmental changes such as the economic downturn, public spending cuts, an ageing population and climate change, the broader social and environmental contributions of the private sector to local resilience have begun to be recognised by researchers and policy-makers. However, we lack a detailed understanding of the nature of, and motivations for, these different contributions.This paper discusses the findings of a case study in South Australia which aimed to enhance our understanding of the role of private sector enterprises in local development and resilience. In particular, this article explores What, How and Why questions: What are the economic and social contributions of rural businesses to local resilience?, How are these contributions made? and Why do business owners make these contributions?The findings reveal that rural businesses contribute to local resilience in both direct and indirect ways. Direct contributions include, for example, the creation of local employment and local product and service delivery. Indirect contributions can be understood as the knock-on effect or added value of primary business activities. For example, the provision of employment opportunities helps to reduce the risk of out-migration and depopulation. With reference to the concept of embeddedness, the study demonstrates the importance of the rural context in shaping the behaviour of rural business owners and encouraging them to operate in economically, socially and environmentally responsible ways. However, this is not a passive relationship; rural business owners have the motivation and resources to respond to specific local challenges, opportunities and characteristics, and to proactively and skilfully turn them into entrepreneurial opportunities. As such, they become part of the adaptation process, acting as agents of change in supporting rural resilience. This adaptation process contributes to enhanced community resilience which enables the modification of existing structures and the seeking of solutions to economic, social and environmental challenges. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Embeddedness; Local (economic, social, environmental) development; Private sector businesses; Resilience; Rural","Australia; South Australia; economic development; employment; entrepreneur; private sector; rural economy; rural society; social development","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84936765007"

Research Question/Issue: Considering the recent financial and economic crisis as a unique exogenous shock, our study investigates the financial performance of family-controlled firms in “steady-state” conditions as opposed to situations of severe economic distress. In addition, we focus our attention within family firms in order to tease out the leadership (family or non-family CEO) and family ownership (family ownership concentration or dispersion) conditions that allow some governance arrangements to perform better than others during an economic downturn. Research Findings/Insights: Examining the entire population of Italian industrial family and non-family publicly listed companies over the period 2002–2012, we observe a significantly and consistently better performance of family-controlled firms during the financial and economic crisis, a finding that proves to be robust to several analytical specifications, as well as to different performance measures (ROA, ROE). Then, focusing on family firms only, we find that mixed configurations (family CEOs with relatively lower family ownership concentration) produce better performance in the face of an external hazard. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Our study confirms the pivotal assumption of the socioemotional wealth perspective that the advantages of family firms show up exactly when ownership is at stake. Our results also add to the growing literature on the resilience of family firms, showing that they are more able than others to absorb exogenous shocks. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our findings suggest the importance of crafting governance structures well in advance of a crisis. Our research speaks to policymakers, indicating the importance of family firms for national economies, and the political opportunity to sustain their growth and managerial development. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Corporate Governance; Family Firms; Financial Crisis; Leadership; Ownership","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84949894815"

While much research focuses on the impacts of industry downturn and closure on well-being, this paper is focused on the implications of large-scale resource development and rapid growth in boomtowns. In contrast to a long tradition of research in other parts of the developed world, relatively few studies explicitly examine the relationship between resource reliance and socio-economic well-being in Australia's resource-dependent regions. Within the context of a nationwide resources boom, this paper presents an analysis of resource dependence and socio-economic well-being in the remote mining towns of Kalgoorlie-Boulder, Port Hedland and Karratha-Dampier in Western Australia. The paper looks into the anatomy of the resources boom in terms of local demographic and economic change, and examines a range of socio-economic indicators, such as income, cost of living, housing affordability, welfare receipts and unemployment. The paper then contemplates the implications of rapid growth in Western Australia's resource boomtowns and the associated challenges for regional governance. © 2011 Geographical Society of New South Wales Inc.","Boomtowns; Resource dependence; Socio-economic well-being; Western Australia","Australia; Western Australia; economic growth; mining industry; resource development; socioeconomic conditions; socioeconomic impact; socioeconomic indicator; socioeconomic status","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-79958085595"

These parents struggle with how to handle children's consumer wants, which continue unabated despite the economic downturn. And, indeed, parents and other adults continue to spend billions of dollars on children every year. Why do children seem to desire so much, so often, so soon, and why do parents capitulate so readily? To determine what forces lie behind the onslaught of Nintendo Wiis and Bratz dolls, Allison J. Pugh spent three years observing and interviewing children and their families. In Longing and Belonging: Parents, Children, and Consumer Culture, Pugh teases out the complex factors that contribute to how we buy, from lunchroom conversations about Game Boys to the stark inequalities facing American children. Pugh finds that children's desires stem less from striving for status or falling victim to advertising than from their yearning to join the conversation at school or in the neighborhood. Most parents respond to children's need to belong by buying the particular goods and experiences that act as passports in children's social worlds, because they sympathize with their children's fear of being different from their peers. Even under financial constraints, families prioritize children ""feeling normal"". Pugh masterfully illuminates the surprising similarities in the fears and hopes of parents and children from vastly different social contexts, showing that while corporate marketing and materialism play a part in the commodification of childhood, at the heart of the matter is the desire to belong. © 2009 by The Regents of the University of California.","","","Book","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-61049408882"

Land use transformations have resulted in significant losses of arable land, and new state policies to conserve land and control land use through the revised Land Administration Law. Critical comparison of industrial development in the special zone phenomenon and the evolving land use disposition system demonstrates contradictory domestic political and economic policies of land development, land management, and land conservation. This analysis assesses land development trends in the south China coastal zone and adopts a geographical approach to examine the spatialities of the land use regime, across the administrative hierarchy, in the nature of the distinct rural and urban land use markets, and in land monitoring problems. Problems revealed in the land disposition system demonstrate how the state's land use regime has promoted land development. New controls over land use coincided with the need to restrict service sector development in real estate and related industries at the onset of the regional economic downturn in 1997.","","China; arable land; export led development; land market; land use planning; zoning policy","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0034890923"

In line with historic crises and shock events including the 2002-04 SARS outbreak, the 2011 Christchurch earthquake and 2017 Hurricane Irma, COVID-19 has significantly impacted global economic conditions, causing significant economic downturns, company and industry failures, and increased unemployment. To understand how conditions created by the pandemic to date compare to the aforementioned shock events, we conducted a thorough literature review focusing on the presentation of panic buying and herd mentality behaviours, changes to discretionary consumer spending as defined by Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs, and the impact of global media on these behaviours. The methodology utilised to analyse panic buying, herd mentality and altered patterns of consumer discretionary spending (according to Maslow’s theory) involved an analysis of consumer spending data, largely focused on Australian and American markets. Here, we analysed the volume and timing of consumer spending patterns; the volumes of spending on specific, highly-demanded consumer goods during the investigative period; and the distribution of spending on luxury and non-durable goods to identify the occurrence of these consumer behaviours. Moreover, to identify the presence of the media in influencing consumer behaviour we focused on web traffic to media sites, alongside keyword and phrase data mining. We conclude that, to date, consumer behaviour during the COVID-19 crisis appears to align with behaviours exhibited during historic shock events. We hope to contribute to the body of research on the early months of this pandemic before longer-term studies are available. © 2020 by the authors.","consumer behaviour; coronavirus; COVID-19; discretionary spending; herd mentality; media; panic buying","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85165773226"

A cubic (i.e. N-shaped) relationship between GDP and CO2 emissions is found to fit the data most appropriately for the period 1960-1999, and a structural break is identified in the mid-seventies due to the oil price shock. Furthermore, two variables are additionally significant: import shares reflecting the well-known pollution haven hypothesis, and the share of the tertiary (service) sector of total production (GDP) accounting for structural changes in the economy. Emission projections derived from this single country specification support the widely held opinion that significant policy changes are asked for when implementing the Kyoto Protocol in order to bring about a downturn in future carbon emissions. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

Results show no significant difference between companies with higher and lower reputations in 1987, when the market dropped over 20 per cent in one day. During this crisis, there was a high volume of automated computer trading and a great deal of investor panic which may have precluded rational investment decision making. In 1989, however, when the market took a less severe sudden, unexpected downturn, the stock prices of companies with better reputations dropped significantly less than those of companies not favored with such positive standing. This supports the hypothesis that good corporate reputations provide a reservoir of goodwill which buffers companies from market decline in times of uncertainty and economic turmoil (short of a panic), underscoring the importance of attentive reputation management. © 2000, Palgrave Macmillan.","advertising; brand; communications; corporate branding; e-communication; identity; image; intangibles; philanthropy; positioning; reputation; stakeholder","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85053851575"

As cost pressures continue to mount in this era of economic downturns, a growing number of firms have begun to explore the possibility of managing product returns in a more cost-efficient manner. However, few studies have addressed the problem of determining the number and location of centralized return centers (i.e., reverse consolidation points) where returned products from retailers or end-customers were collected, sorted, and consolidated into a large shipment destined for manufacturers'; or distributors'; repair facilities. To fill the void in such a line of research, this paper proposes a nonlinear mixed-integer programming model and a genetic algorithm that can solve the reverse logistics problem involving product returns. The usefulness of the proposed model and algorithm was validated by its application to an illustrative example dealing with products returned from online sales. © 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Genetic algorithm; Location-allocation; Reverse logistics","Costs; Integer programming; Logistics; Sales; Cost pressures; Cost saving; Cost-efficient; Economic downturn; Genetic algorithm approach; Location-allocation; Multiechelon; Product returns; Reverse logistic networks; Reverse logistics; Genetic algorithms","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-24144451811"

This article explores two aspects of this set of rules: its decentralization and the unusual powers it gives to private actors to invoke dispute settlement. Decentralization has contributed to a competitive environment for ratification of bilateral investment treaties (BITs) and has elevated the importance of dyadic bargaining power in the formation of the regime. Governments of developing countries are more likely to enter into BITs and tie their hands more tightly when they are in a weak bargaining position, which in turn is associated with economic downturns of the domestic economy. Once committed, investors have sued governments with surprising regularity, arguably contributing disproportionately to legal awards that favor the private corporate actors who have the power to convene the dispute settlement system. States have begun to push back, revising their obligations and attempting to annul arbitral awards. One of the conclusions is that it is important not only to consider whether BITs attract capital - which has been the focus of nearly all the empirical research on BIT effects - but also to investigate the governance consequences of the international investment regime generally.

In this article, I argue that this is a systemic crisis - a crisis of what Hyman Minsky called money manager capitalism. I link this to the analyses of Hilferding and Veblen of an earlier period, finance capitalism, and argue that this is, in effect, the second failure of this type of capitalism. The essential characteristics of early finance capitalism are: relatively small government, use of external finance for investment, and growing concentration of economic power in the hands of 'trusts' - or what we might today call megacorporations with varied interests and diverse affiliations across 'industry' and 'finance' and 'insurance'. Unlike the first phase, the second phase of finance capitalism took place in the context of a big government, neoconservative model. Minsky's analysis helps us to understand how the New Deal and big government created a paternalistic capitalism after World War II, which favoured high consumption, high employment, greater equality and financial stability; however, that stability was destabilising because it permitted the rise of managed money. Over time, innovation and deregulation increased fragility, which generated increasingly frequent and severe financial crises. While previous crises were resolved quickly enough to prevent 'it' (another debt deflation) from happening again, this crisis appears to be sufficiently severe that the very survival of money manager capitalism is thrown into question. The article examines the contributing factors to the current crisis, including the real estate boom and bust, the rise of risky financial instruments such as securitised debts and credit default swaps, the commodities market bubble and the fiscal squeeze. The article concludes with some suggestions concerning the possible outcome of the failure of this form of finance capitalism. © The Author 2009.

Now, as the world struggles to recover, it's tempting to blame what happened on just a few greedy bankers who took irrational risks and left the rest of us to foot the bill. In Fault Lines, Rajan argues that serious flaws in the economy are also to blame, and warns that a potentially more devastating crisis awaits us if they aren't fixed. Rajan shows how the individual choices that collectively brought about the economic meltdown--made by bankers, government officials, and ordinary homeowners--were rational responses to a flawed global financial order in which the incentives to take on risk are incredibly out of step with the dangers those risks pose. He traces the deepening fault lines in a world overly dependent on the indebted American consumer to power global economic growth and stave off global downturns. He exposes a system where America's growing inequality and thin social safety net create tremendous political pressure to encourage easy credit and keep job creation robust, no matter what the consequences to the economy's long-term health; and where the U.S. financial sector, with its skewed incentives, is the critical but unstable link between an overstimulated America and an underconsuming world. In Fault Lines, Rajan demonstrates how unequal access to education and health care in the United States puts us all in deeper financial peril, even as the economic choices of countries like Germany, Japan, and China place an undue burden on America to get its policies right. He outlines the hard choices we need to make to ensure a more stable world economy and restore lasting prosperity. © 2010 by Princeton University Press.

Librarians are responding with service innovations in areas such as bibliometrics and research data management. Previous surveys have investigated research data support within North America and other research services globally with small samples. An online multiple-choice questionnaire was used to survey bibliometric and data support activities of 140 libraries in Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, and the United Kingdom, including current and planned services, target audiences, service constraints, and staff training needs. A majority of respondents offered or planned bibliometrics training, citation reports, and impact calculations but with significant differences between countries. Current levels of engagement in data management were lower than for bibliometrics, but a majority anticipated future involvement, especially in technology assistance, data deposit, and policy development. Initiatives were aimed at multiple constituencies, with university administrators being important clients and partners for bibliometric services. Gaps in knowledge, skills, and confidence were significant constraints, with near-universal support for including bibliometrics and particularly data management in professional education and continuing development programs. The study also found that librarians need a multilayered understanding of the research environment. © 2013 The Board of Trustees, University of Illinois.","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84878452777"

We study how economic downturns, as measured by various indicators, especially by declining GDP levels, falling consumer confdence, and rising unemployment, were found to affect fertility. We also discuss particular mechanisms through which the recession may have influenced fertility behavior, including the effects of economic uncertainty, falling income, changes in the housing market, and rising enrollment in higher education, and also factors that influence fertility indirectly such as declining marriage rates. Most studies find that fertility tends to be pro-cyclical and often rises and declines with the ups and downs of the business cycle. Usually, these aggregate effects are relatively small (typically, a few percentage points) and of short durations; in addition they often influence especially the timing of childbearing and in most cases do not leave an imprint on cohort fertility levels. Therefore, major long-term fertility shifts often continue seemingly uninterrupted during the recession-including the fertility declines before and during the Great Depression of the 1930s and before and during the oil shock crises of the 1970s. Changes in the opportunity costs of childbearing and fertility behavior during economic downturn vary by sex, age, social status, and number of children; childless young adults are usually most affected. Furthermore, various policies and institutions may modify or even reverse the relationship between recessions and fertility. The first evidence pertaining to the recent recession falls in line with these findings. In most countries, the recession has brought a decline in the number of births and fertility rates, often marking a sharp halt to the previous decade of rising fertility rates. © 2011 The Population Council, Inc.","","Birth Rate; Developed Countries; Economic Recession; Fertility; History, 20th Century; History, 21st Century; Population Dynamics; Public Health; business cycle; childbearing; economic conditions; economic impact; fertility; financial crisis; Gross Domestic Product; higher education; unemployment; birth rate; developed country; economic recession; economics; education; ethnology; fertility; history; legal aspect; population dynamics; public health; review","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-79959513250"

Yet this widespread public concern has not been matched by attention from political scientists regarding how citizens experience and understand the economic risks they face or how those experiences and understandings shape their views of public policy. We develop here an argument about the role of personal economic experiences in the formation of policy attitudes that we validate using a distinctive opinion survey of our own design, fielded not long after the onset of the Great Recession. The survey tracks citizens' economic experiences, expectations, and policy attitudes within multiple domains of risk (employment, medical care, family, and wealth arrangements). These investigations show that economic insecurity systematically and substantially affects citizens' attitudes toward government's role. Citizens' economic worries largely track exposure to substantial economic shocks. Citizens' policy attitudes in turn appear highly responsive to economic worries, as well as to the experience of economic shocks-with worries and shocks creating greater support for government policies that buffer the relevant economic risk. Attitudes seem most affected by temporally proximate shocks, shocks befalling households that have weak private safety nets, and shocks occurring within the domain most relevant to the policy in question, though attitudes are also (more weakly) correlated with shocks in other domains. The magnitude of these associations rivals partisanship and ideology and almost always exceeds that for conventional measures of socio-economic status. Given the long-term increase in economic insecurity and current sluggish recovery, understanding how insecurity shapes citizens' policy attitudes and political behavior should be a major concern of political science. © 2013 American Political Science Association.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84875499222"

We then evaluate representative papers in the empirical literature on banks' financial reporting and stability, pointing out the research design issues that empirical accounting researchers need to confront to develop well-specified tests able to generate reliably interpretable findings.

Is this because crises tend to take place during economic downturns, or do banking sector problems have independent negative real effects? If banking crises exogenously hinder real activity, then sectors more dependent on external finance should perform relatively worse during banking crises. The evidence in this paper supports this view. The differential effects across sectors are stronger in developing countries, in countries with less access to foreign finance, and where banking crises were more severe.

Design/methodology/approach: Aside from the health and humanitarian crisis, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused an acute economic downturn in most sectors, forcing public and private organizations to rethink and reconfigure service provision. The paper introduces the concept of imposed service innovation as a new strategic lens to augment the extant view of service innovation as a primarily discretionary activity. Findings: The identified imposed service innovations were assigned to 11 categories and examined in terms of their strategic horizon and strategic stretch. The innovations are characterized by spatial flexibility, social and health outreach and exploitation of technology. Research limitations/implications: As a new area of service innovation research, imposed service innovations highlight strategic issues that include the primacy of customers and the fragility of institutions. Practical implications: Situations involving imposed service innovation represent opportunities for rapid business development when recognized as such. A severe disruption such as a pandemic can catalyze managerial rethinking as organizations are forced to look beyond their existing business strategies. Social implications: As a strategic response to severe disruption of institutions, markets and service offerings, imposed service innovations afford opportunities to implement transformation and enhance well-being. This novel strategic lens foregrounds a societal account of service innovation, emphasizing societal relevance and context beyond the challenges of business viability alone. Originality/value: While extant service innovation research has commonly focused on discretionary activities that enable differentiation and growth, imposed service innovations represent actions for resilience and renewal. © 2020, Kristina Heinonen and Tore Strandvik.","Disruption; Dynamic capabilities; Pandemic; Resilience; Service innovation","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85090991750"

This paper contributes to the literature by exploring the relationship between industry diversity and economic resilience over time. Using fixed effects models with data from the Bureau of Labour Statistics and the Census Bureau, the paper examines the influence of industrial diversity and concentration on unemployment rate stability in Ohio counties between 1977 and 2011. Results indicate that while more concentrated counties had lower unemployment rates when times were good, counties with more diverse industry structures fared better during times of national or local employment shocks. The paper also finds that there is a relationship between concentration in particular industries and the ability to withstand a shock changes over the 35 years examined, thus highlighting the need to take care when interpreting findings over shorter periods and the need to consider the particular industry of dependence. While local policymakers have little ability to affect industrial concentration in the short run, the paper recommends that highly concentrated counties adopt policies that may help buffer their economies to effects of negative shocks. © 2016, © Urban Studies Journal Limited 2016.","agglomeration economies; economic resilience; industrial concentration; industrial diversity; unemployment","Ohio; United States; agglomeration; economic development; empirical analysis; employment; industrial agglomeration; industrial enterprise; labor policy; policy making; sustainability; temporal analysis; unemployment","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85016330844"

The crisis was deepened, but by no means caused, by the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. The root cause was the end of a temporary revenue ""bubble"" after the first Iraq war, leading to historically high airline profits and major capacity expansions. After the end of the ""golden"" 90s, an economic downturn and a fear of terrorism resulted in massive overcapacities, with yields showing a return to continued long-term decline. Surprisingly at first glance, low-cost carriers (LCCs) were not only spared, but boosted by this massive downturn. Their lean business model offered a compelling alternative at a time when passengers began looking for ways to avoid paying the high prices NCs demanded in order to maintain their complex hub&spoke systems. On continental travel routes, LCCs arc able to deliver 80% of the service quality at less than 50% of the cost of NCs. Consequently, LCCs can-at least in theory-tackle more than 70% of continental O&Ds (in the US as well as in Europe), taking them far from their origins as niche businesses. However, for most intercontinental routes (as well as some continental ones) bundling demand in a hub remains an indispensable requirement. The challenge for NCs is now to reinvent their own business model. If they succeed in providing almost the same service level at drastically reduced cost, they would not only stabilize their position, but also lead the industry as a whole to the next level of efficiency. This article analyzes the key drivers of the current transition phase and outlines the vision of advanced airline business models that potentially lead to a new era of equilibrium. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Christopher Achen and Larry Bartels deploy a wealth of social-scientific evidence, including ingenious original analyses of topics ranging from abortion politics and budget deficits to the Great Depression and shark attacks, to show that the familiar ideal of thoughtful citizens steering the ship of state from the voting booth is fundamentally misguided. They demonstrate that voters-even those who are well informed and politically engaged-mostly choose parties and candidates on the basis of social identities and partisan loyalties, not political issues. They also show that voters adjust their policy views and even their perceptions of basic matters of fact to match those loyalties. When parties are roughly evenly matched, elections often turn on irrelevant or misleading considerations such as economic spurts or downturns beyond the incumbents’ control; the outcomes are essentially random. Thus, voters do not control the course of public policy, even indirectly. Achen and Bartels argue that democratic theory needs to be founded on identity groups and political parties, not on the preferences of individual voters. Democracy for Realists provides a powerful challenge to conventional thinking, pointing the way toward a fundamentally different understanding of the realities and potential of democratic government. © 2016 by Princeton University Press.","","","Book","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85199505007"

Liquidation values and debt capacity: a market equilibrium approach. Journal of Finance 47, 1343-1366]. We find the fire-sales effect to be also at work: Creditors recover less if the industry is in distress and non-defaulted firms in the industry are illiquid, particularly if the industry is characterized by assets that are specific, that is, not easily redeployable by other industries, and if the debt is collateralized by such specific assets. The interaction effect of industry-level distress and asset-specificity is strongest for senior unsecured creditors, is economically significant, and robust to contract-specific, firm-specific, macroeconomic, and bond-market supply effects. We also document that defaulted firms in distressed industries are more likely to emerge as restructured firms than to be acquired or liquidated, and spend longer time in bankruptcy. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

We further demonstrate the special role of input-output linkages in generating tail comovements, whereby large recessions involve not only significant GDP contractions, but also large simultaneous declines across a wide range of industries.","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85009168128"

The resource community cycle was accelerated and local communities forced to consider ways of attracting secondary investment and/or alternative industries early in the operational life of the Coppabella mine in order to secure significant economic benefits and to guard against the erosion of social capital and the ability to cope with future downturns in the mining sector. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

It concludes that financial turmoil characterized by banking distress is more likely to be associated with deeper and longer downturns than stress mainly in securities or foreign exchange markets.

Flatters and Willmott trace the paths of eight trends as they entered the recession and project their trajectories into the recovery. The authors' analysis paints a picture of chastened new consumers who will seek simplicity in products and services; take companies' boardroom ethics into account in purchase decisions; pursue ""discretionary"" thrift (virtuous but not essential cost cutting); flit capriciously from brand to brand; make green consumption more a matter of reducing waste than purchasing premium products; and steer away from frivolous, extreme leisure experiences in favor of wholesome, authentic ones.

They did not predict that the financial crisis would happen; and when it did, they understated its effects. Monetary authorities allowed bubbles to grow and focused on keeping inflation low, partly because the standard models suggested that low inflation was necessary and almost sufficient for efficiency and growth. After the crisis broke, policymakers relying on the models floundered. Notwithstanding the diversity of macroeconomics, the sum of these failures points to the need for a fundamental re-examination of the models-and a reassertion of the lessons of modern general equilibrium theory that were seemingly forgotten in the years leading up to the crisis. This paper first describes the failures of the standard models in broad terms, and then develops the economics of deep downturns, and shows that such downturns are endogenous. Further, the paper argues that there have been systemic changes to the structure of the economy that made the economy more vulnerable to crisis, contrary to what the standard models argued. Finally, the paper contrasts the policy implications of our framework with those of the standard models. © 2011 by the European Economic Association.","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-79960032862"

This paper discusses four central issues that have emerged in the academic and policy debates related to firm financing during the downturn. First, the economic crisis triggered by the pandemic is radically different from past crises, with important consequences for optimal policy responses. Second, it is important to preserve firms’ relationships with key stakeholders (e.g., workers, suppliers, customers, and creditors) to avoid inefficient bankruptcies and long-term detrimental economic effects. Third, firms can benefit from “hibernation,” incurring the minimum bare expenses necessary to withstand the pandemic while using credit to remain alive until the crisis subdues. Fourth, the existing legal and regulatory infrastructure is ill-equipped to deal with an exogenous systemic shock like a pandemic. Financial sector policies can help channel credit to firms, but they are hard to implement and entail different trade-offs. © 2020","Cash crush; Coronavirus; Credit risk; Financial policies; Firm relationships","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85099248251"

It reveals considerable diversity of experience, with one in seven cities described as resurgent on a strict definition of decline followed by growth. They are outnumbered by cities that have experienced continuous growth and those that have had a recent downturn. Taking a long-term overview, the growth of European cities has generally slowed over the last few decades. A short-term perspective suggests something of a recovery within the last five years. Growth and revival are more common in Western Europe and decline is more widespread in the East.

Design/methodology/approach - This paper uses a case-based approach to demonstrate how supply chain financial management techniques, such as cash-to-cash and shared weighted average cost of capital (WACC), can reduce the financial costs experience by a supply chain. Findings - This paper provides a methodology to identify and quantify the potential opportunities to increase profitability throughout the supply. Scenarios are offered that illuminate potential supply chain improvements gained by collaborative management of cash-to-cash cycles and sharing WACC with trading partners. Research limitations/implications - These financial techniques are readily available for use in collaborative supply chain structures. Practical implications - Coordinating financial management across the supply chain is a potential tool to align and improve the financial performance of collaborating firms. This method extends to the supply chain those historically firm-centric financial management concepts such as return on capital and cash flow. The impact is reduced overall cost generated by leveraging the financial strength of the entire supply chain. During economic downturns and times of tight credit proactively managing financials across the supply chain may be the only way some suppliers remain afloat. Originality/value - Two firm level financial management approaches are extended and they are adopted for use across the supply chain: cash-to-cash management; and leveraging a shared supply chain financing rate. This paper builds on the increasing body of research and practice that suggests trading firm-optimized for supply chain optimized performance reduces overall cost and improves customer value. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Cash flow; Finance; Supplier relations; Supply chain management","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-70350399357"

The structure of UK house prices has been impacted markedly by the Labour Government's efforts to ingrain a particular notion of financial literacy amid the move towards an increasingly asset-based system of welfare. New model welfare recipients and new model homeowners have thereby been co-constituted in a manner consistent with a new UK growth regime of 'house price Keynesianism'. However, the investor subjects who drive such growth are necessarily rendered uncertain compared with the idealised image of government policy because of their reliance on the credit-creating decisions of private financial institutions. The recent steep decline in UK house prices is explained here as an epiphenomenon of the disruptive effect on the idealised image caused by the dependence of investor subjects on pricing dynamics not of their making. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.","Asset-based welfare; House price Keynesianism; Investor subjects; New Labour; UK house price collapse","United Kingdom; conceptual framework; economic structure; governance approach; homeowner; homeownership; housing market; investment; Keynesian theory; price dynamics; welfare economics","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-77951787987"

In August 2008 the Chinese government launched a three-year reconstruction plan. This paper examines the progress made in the first year of reconstruction in rural Wenchuan and the challenges that remain. As the area struck by the earthquake was poor, the paper pays particular attention to the relationships between reconstruction, disaster mitigation and poverty alleviation. The research shows that the speed and quality of state-led reconstruction is high, and that the effectiveness of reconstruction depended vitally on a clear action plan and consistent and effective co-ordination and integration of actors involved in its implementation. Existing research also shows that poverty is a major driver of the impact of disasters. This research shows that priority was attached to resettlement of the rural population and that poverty alleviation features strongly in the reconstruction plans. Although there is evidence of pro-poor policies, most resources were not concentrated on the poor population within the zone. The main reason why is that the allocation of resources was driven by damage assessments. House reconstruction in particular has however occurred at the expense of substantial increases in household indebtedness.

This is most clearly evident for automobile, the industry with the largest drop in trade. However, relative to the magnitude of the U.S. downturn, these movements in trade are quite typical. The paper develops a two-country general equilibrium model with endogenous inventory holdings in response to frictions in domestic and foreign transactions costs. With more severe frictions on international transactions, in a downturn, the calibrated model shows a larger decline in output and an even larger decline in international trade, relative to a more standard model without inventories.

Design/methodology/approach: The data comprise two national-level surveys conducted in Finland in 2008, representing an economic boom, and in 2010 when the global economic crisis had hit the Finnish market. Partial least square path analysis is used to test the potential mediating effect of innovation capability on the relationship between MO and business performance during economic boom and bust. Findings: The results show that innovation capability fully mediates the performance effects of a MO during an economic upturn, whereas the mediation is only partial during a downturn. Innovation capability also mediates the relationship between a customer orientation and business performance during an upturn, whereas the mediating effect culminates in a competitor orientation during a downturn. Thus, the role of innovation capability as a mediator between the individual market-orientation components varies along the business cycle. Originality/value: This paper is one of the first studies that empirically examine the impact of the economic cycle on the relationship between strategic marketing concepts, such as MO or innovation capability, and the firm's business performance. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Business performance; Economic fluctuation; Financial crisis; Innovation capability; Market orientation; PLS","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84897063982"

For years, the dominant paradigm in macroeconomics, which assumed that income distribution did not matter, at least for macroeconomic behavior, ignored inequality-both its role in causing crises and the effect of fluctuations in general, and crises in particular, on inequality. But the most recent financial crisis has shown the errors in this thinking, and these views are finally beginning to be questioned. Economists who had looked at the average equity of a homeowner-ignoring the distribution-felt comfortable that the economy could easily withstand a large fall in housing prices. When such a fall occurred, however, it had disastrous effects, because a large fraction of homeowners owed more on their homes than the value of the home, leading to waves of foreclosure and economic stress. Policy-makers and economists alike have begun to take note: inequality can contribute to volatility and the creation of crises, and volatility can contribute to inequality. Here, we explore the variety of channels through which inequality affects fluctuations and fluctuations affect inequality, and explore how some of the changes in our economy may have contributed to increased inequality and volatility both directly and indirectly. After describing the two-way relationship, the paper discusses hysteresis-the fact that the consequences of an economic downturn can be long-lived. Then, it examines how policy can either mitigate or exacerbate the inequality consequences of economic downturns, and shows how well-intentioned policies can sometimes be counterproductive. Finally, it links these issues to human development, especially in developing countries. © 2012 Human Development and Capability Association.","Development; Financial crises; Hysteresis; Inequality; Volatility","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84868158934"

In this paper, we take a structural approach to investigate the effects of wages and working hours on health behaviors of low-educated persons using variations in wages and hours caused by changes in local economic activity. In the empirical analysis, we adopt a two-sample instrumental variables approach to combine the data on individual health behaviors from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) with the data on individual employment from the Current Population Survey (CPS). The total sample size of the combined CPS-BRFSS data for the time period of 1984-2005 is 967,594, while that of the combined CPS-NHIS data for the time period of 1976-2001 is 364,078. We find that increases in wages caused by economic expansions are associated with greater consumption of cigarettes in the United States. We also find that increases in hours of work caused by economic expansions are associated with more cigarette consumption, but less physical activity and physician visits. More importantly, the evidence suggests that most of such effects associated with changes in hours of work can be attributed to the changes at the extensive margin of employment, meaning the changes in employment status, rather than the changes at the intensive margin, meaning changes in hours of work conditional on being employed. These findings imply that changes in employment may have heterogeneous impacts on time-intensive and less time-intensive health behaviors and also provide additional evidence on the importance of time in health production, particularly for time-intensive activities. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Binge drinking; Cigarette smoking; Doctor visits; Hours of work; Physical activity; Two-sample instrumental variables; United States; Wage","Adult; Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System; Binge Drinking; Educational Status; Empirical Research; Employment; Health Surveys; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Motor Activity; Office Visits; Salaries and Fringe Benefits; Smoking; Time Factors; United States; Workload; United States; business cycle; empirical analysis; employment; health care; public health; smoking; wage; article; commercial phenomena; economic development; educational status; employment status; health behavior; human; medical care; physical activity; productivity; salary; sample size; smoking; socioeconomics; United States; work schedule","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84871610907"

The debt initiation decisions of these firms are not preceded by shocks to their entrenchment, such as takeover threats or the emergence of activist blockholders. Our evidence supports the hypothesis that these firms are financially constrained. Zero-debt firms are small, young, conserve cash from cash-flow, and are more likely to lease their assets. When they have access to a line of credit, they face stricter covenants and higher all-in costs than comparable control firms.

Exploring systematic SDG strategies is urgently needed to aid recovery from the pandemic and reinvigorate global SDG actions. Based on available data and comprehensive analysis of the literature, this paper highlights ongoing challenges facing the SDGs, identifies the effects of COVID-19 on SDG progress, and proposes a systematic framework for promoting the achievement of SDGs in the post-pandemic era. Progress towards attaining the SDGs was already lagging behind even before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Inequitable distribution of food–energy–water resources and environmental crises clearly threaten SDG implementation. Evidently, there are gaps between the vision for SDG realization and actual capacity that constrain national efforts. The turbulent geopolitical environment, spatial inequities, and trade-offs limit the effectiveness of SDG implementation. The global public health crisis and socio-economic downturn under COVID-19 have further impeded progress toward attaining the SDGs. Not only has the pandemic delayed SDG advancement in general, but it has also amplified spatial imbalances in achieving progress, undermined connectivity, and accentuated anti-globalization sentiment under lockdowns and geopolitical conflicts. Nevertheless, positive developments in technology and improvement in environmental conditions have also occurred. In reflecting on the overall situation globally, it is recommended that post-pandemic SDG actions adopt a “Classification–Coordination–Collaboration” framework. Classification facilitates both identification of the current development status and the urgency of SDG achievement aligned with national conditions. Coordination promotes domestic/international and inter-departmental synergy for short-term recovery as well as long-term development. Cooperation is key to strengthening economic exchanges, promoting technological innovation, and building a global culture of sustainable development that is essential if the endeavor of achieving the SDGs is to be successful. Systematic actions are urgently needed to get the SDG process back on track. © 2022, The Author(s).","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135582175"

From witnessing a technological boom and awareness about the environment to renewable energy and conscious use of natural resources, the current century had offered a lot in the previous two decades. However, the question of natural resources being a curse or a blessing to the natural resource-producing economies is still unanswered and gathers many scholars' attention. The current study investigates the volatility of natural resources, oil and gold, and studies the impact of volatility in natural resource prices for resource-producing economies. The global market for crude oil has experienced significant downturns during the last two decades, the financial crisis of 2008 and the Covid 19 crisis of 2020, for instance. Compared to that, the global gold market has experienced relatively less impactful downturns during the same period. We explore how the volatility in oil and gold prices impact the growth of the resource-producing economies. The study is conducted on the top oil-producing countries and the top gold-producing countries on data from 2000 to 2020. The study finds that in the long run, the volatility in both oil and gold markets could be detrimental to the economic growth as measured by the GDP for the resource-producing economies. Our research also shows that the impact of the volatility in prices on the growth of economies is not consistent for all resource-producing economies in the short-term using PMG/ARDL methodology. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","ARDL; Economic growth; Gold; Natural resources; Oil; Volatility","Costs; Economic analysis; Gold; International trade; 'current; ARDL; Economic growths; Global market; Gold; Gold market; Oil; Renewable energies; Resource price; Volatility; COVID-19; crude oil; economic growth; financial crisis; gold; Gross Domestic Product; natural resource; price dynamics; Natural resources","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85105326732"

Countries introduced public health measures to contain and reduce its spread. These measures included closures of educational institutions, non-essential businesses, events and activities, as well as working from and staying at home requirements. These measures have led to an economic downturn of unprecedented proportions. Generally, as economic activity declines, travel decreases and drivers are exposed to a lower risk of collisions. However, research on previous economic downturns suggests economic downturns differentially affect driver behaviours and situations. COVID-19 pandemic effects on road safety are currently unknown. However, preliminary information on factors such as the increased stress and anxiety brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, more “free” (idle) time, increased consumption of alcohol and drugs, and greater opportunities for speeding and stunt driving, might well have the opposite effect on road safety. Using an interactionist model we identify research questions for researchers to consider on potential person and situation factors associated with COVID-19 that could affect road safety during and after the pandemic.

As the civic voluntarism model and grievances theory predict different effects of economic downturn on political participation, the crisis provides a unique context to evaluate the explanatory power of these two theories. It is found that, when investigating a period of eight years (2002–2010), economic growth is positively associated with non-institutionalised political participation, which is in line with the civic voluntarism model. However, when focusing on the changes in political participation that occurred between 2008 and 2010 it is found that rising unemployment is associated with rising levels of non-institutionalised political participation, suggesting that grievance theory is especially useful in exceptionally negative conditions as suddenly imposed grievances can lead to various forms of protest behaviour. The article argues that these shock experiences can lead to momentary peak periods of mobilisation. © 2015, © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","","Europe; economic growth; economic instability; financial crisis; political participation; unemployment; voluntary approach","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84924164698"

Design/methodology/approach – A research project was designed in the Spanish services sector. Companies that had already participated in activities with regard to business excellence were randomly selected and approached through a structured questionnaire, yielding a sample of 151 responding companies. By analyzing TQM implementation and company performance through the exploratory factor analysis, specific TQM factors and performance dimensions are extracted. The TQM factors that significantly influence the performance dimensions are determined through multiple linear regression analyses. Findings – According to the findings, the factors describing TQM implementation in service companies concern quality practices of top management, employee quality management, process management, employee knowledge and education and customer focus. Similarly, the performance dimensions revealed concern financial performance, operational performance, customer satisfaction and product/service quality performance. The TQM factors concerning customers, employees and top management significantly affect the performance dimensions. Research limitations/implications – The subjective data were collected from quality managers of a small-sized sample of companies operating in a European Union country and belonging to different services sub-sectors. Based on these limitations, future research studies are recommended. Practical implications – By focussing on specific TQM factors, a service company can improve its performance dimensions. In doing so, it can lay the foundations not only to survive but to be competitive in the current global scenario that is characterized by an economic downturn. Originality/value – This paper describes a reliable TQM model that can be implemented in the services sector and a means by which a service company can improve its performance. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Company performance; Service companies; Spain; Total quality management","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84960425765"

Scholars have long argued that environmental preferences decline during economic downturns as individuals prioritize short-term economic needs over longer-term environmental concerns. Yet, this assumption has rarely been subjected to rigorous empirical scrutiny at the individual level. The presumed link between economic and environmental preferences is revisited, using the first individual-level opinion panel (n = 1043) of US climate attitudes, incorporating both self-reported and objective economic data. In contrast with prior studies that emphasize the role of economic downturns in driving environmental preference shifts, using a stronger identification strategy, there is little evidence that changes in either individual economic fortunes or local economic conditions are associated with decreased belief that climate change is happening or reduced prioritization of climate policy action. Instead, the evidence suggests that climate belief declines are associated with shifting political cues. These findings have important implications for understanding the dynamics of political conflict over environmental policy globally. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Climate change; economy–environment tradeoff; public opinion","United States; climate change; economic conditions; environmental economics; environmental policy; political conflict; trade-off","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85019028257"

The common form of carbon dioxide utilization in CCUS is to use carbon dioxide as an oil displacement medium to enhance oil recovery (EOR). However, affected by the global economic downturn and the impact of low oil prices, the future development of CCUS-EOR is full of uncertainty. As a market-oriented policy tool, it is widely recognized that carbon trading mechanism can effectively improve the value of CCUS projects and promote the deployment of CCUS projects. In this context, a deferred option model is proposed to quantitatively evaluate the impact of low oil price shocks and carbon trading mechanism on CCUS-EOR project investment based on real options theory. This model takes uncertain factors such as oil price, carbon price and technological learning rate into account, and provides an analytical framework for relevant investment decisions and policymaking. It is found that the current economic environment is not enough to trigger immediate investment of the CCUS project, but the introduction of a carbon trading mechanism can significantly improve the investment value of the project and reduce the investment failure probability. The sensitivity analysis of key parameters such as carbon price, oil price, and their volatility are carried out. The results show that a higher carbon and oil price is needed to make the optimal investment time of the project move forward. It is suggested that the establishment and improvement of the carbon trading mechanism are useful to promote CCUS-EOR investment. However, to accelerate the development of CCUS-EOR in the short term, it also needs the joint efforts of other powerful policy incentive tools. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon capture utilization and storage; Carbon trading mechanism; Oil shock; Real option","Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Developing countries; Global warming; Investments; Sensitivity analysis; Carbon capture utilization and storage; Carbon price; Carbon trading; Carbon trading mechanism; Climate change policies; Enhance oil recoveries; Oil Prices; Oil shock; Real Options; Trading mechanism; Emission control","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85103390852"

Facing the specter of another Great Depression, policymakers across the globe responded in sharply different ways to avert an economic collapse. Why did the response to the crisis—and its impact on individual countries—vary so greatly among interdependent economies? How did political factors like public opinion and domestic interest groups shape policymaking in this moment of economic distress? Coping with Crisis offers a rigorous analysis of the choices societies made as a devastating global economic crisis unfolded. With an ambitiously broad range of inquiry, Coping with Crisis examines the interaction between international and domestic politics to shed new light on the inner workings of democratic politics. The volume opens with an engaging overview of the global crisis and the role played by international bodies like the G-20 and the WTO. In his survey of international initiatives in response to the recession, Eric Helleiner emphasizes the limits of multilateral crisis management, finding that domestic pressures were more important in reorienting fiscal policy. He also argues that unilateral decisions by national governments to hold large dollar reserves played the key role in preventing a dollar crisis, which would have considerably worsened the downturn. David R. Cameron discusses the fiscal responses of the European Union and its member states. He suggests that a profound coordination problem involving fiscal and economic policy impeded the E.U.’s ability to respond in a timely and effective manner. The volume also features several case studies and country comparisons. Nolan McCarty assesses the performance of the American political system during the crisis. He argues that the downturn did little to dampen elite polarization in the U.S.; divisions within the Democratic Party—as well as the influence of the financial sector—narrowed the range of policy options available to fight the crisis. Ben W. Ansell examines how fluctuations in housing prices in 30 developed countries affected the policy preferences of both citizens and political parties. His evidence shows that as housing prices increased, homeowners expressed preferences for both lower taxes and a smaller safety net. As more citizens supplement their day-to-day income with assets like stocks and housing, Ansell’s research reveals a potentially significant trend in the formation of public opinion. Five years on, the prospects for a prolonged slump in economic activity remain high, and the policy choices going forward are contentious. But the policy changes made between 2007 and 2010 will likely constrain any new initiatives in the future. Coping with Crisis offers unmatched analysis of the decisions made in the developed world during this critical period. It is an essential read for scholars of comparative politics and anyone interested in a comprehensive account of the new international politics of austerity. . © 2012 by the Russell Sage Foundation.

We use longitudinal survey data that include pre- and post-reports from the same individuals on a range of health-compromising and health-promoting behaviors. We find that the crisis led to large and significant reductions in health-compromising behaviors (such as smoking, drinking alcohol or soft drinks, and eating sweets) and certain health-promoting behaviors (consumption of fruits and vegetables), but to increases in other health-promoting behaviors (consumption of fish oil and recommended sleep). The magnitudes of effects for smoking are somewhat larger than what has been found in past research in other contexts, while those for alcohol, fruits, and vegetables are in line with estimates from other studies. Changes in work hours, real income, financial assets, mortgage debt, and mental health, together, explain the effects of the crisis on some behaviors (such as consumption of sweets and fast food), while the effects of the crisis on most other behaviors appear to have operated largely through price increases. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Economic crisis; Health behaviors; Iceland; Recessions","Adult; Alcohol Drinking; Costs and Cost Analysis; Diet; Dietary Supplements; Economic Recession; Health Behavior; Health Surveys; Humans; Iceland; Longitudinal Studies; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Smoking; Socioeconomic Factors; Economic crisis; Health behaviors; Iceland; Recessions; alcohol; fish oil; sugar; vitamin; adult; attitude to health; clinical indicator; controlled study; drinking behavior; economic aspect; Economic Crisis; feeding behavior; female; financial asset; health compromising behavior; health impact assessment; human; Iceland; income; male; mental health; middle aged; mortgage debt; normal human; price increase; review; smoking; working time; young adult; aged; alcohol consumption; anxiety; Article; data analysis; diet supplementation; dietary intake; drinking; economic crisis; economic crisis of 2008; economic recession; fast food; fruit; health behavior; health promotion; health survey; Icelander; longitudinal study; major clinical study; questionnaire; soft drink; vegetable; work schedule","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84896708598"

Results suggest that asymmetries in the corporate tax code could have made recent bonus depreciation tax incentives at most 4% less effective than they would have been if all firms were fully taxable. Cash flows have more important effects on the impact of tax incentives. Recent declines in cash flows would predict a 24% decrease in the effectiveness of bonus depreciation.

They examined trends in one major driver of utilization: insurance coverage. The results suggest that the recent economic downturn did not result in an overall decrease in the utilization of dental services. Rather, the findings suggest an earlier decline from 2003 to 2008. In this article, the authors report that the overall trend masked significant variation by age and poverty level. Among children, there was steady growth in utilization from 1997 to 2010. This appears to have coincided with a shift away from private insurance toward public coverage and a significant drop in the percentage of uninsured children. Among non-elderly adults, however, utilization has been falling steadily since 1997 among all but the wealthiest income group. During the great recession from December 2007 to June 2009, the decline in utilization accelerated among those in the lowest income group. The decrease in adult utilization appears related to a decrease in private insurance coverage and an increase in public coverage and noninsured rates. As a consequence of these trends in coverage, the authors predict a continued decline in the utilization of dental services among non-elderly adults.","Dental insurance; Economics; Oral health; Oral health care access; Oral health services","Adolescent; Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Child; Child, Preschool; Dental Care; Dental Health Services; Economic Recession; Humans; Income; Insurance Coverage; Insurance, Dental; Medicaid; Medically Uninsured; Middle Aged; Poverty; Private Sector; United States; Young Adult; adolescent; adult; age; aged; article; child; dental procedure; economic recession; health insurance; human; income; insurance; medicaid; middle aged; organization and management; patient; poverty; preschool child; statistics; United States; utilization review","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84865072135"

This link between RRs and default rates has traditionally been neglected by credit risk models, as most of them focused on default risk and adopted static loss assumptions, treating the RR either as a constant parameter or as a stochastic variable independent from the probability of default (PD). This traditional focus on default analysis has been partly reversed by the recent significant increase in the number of studies dedicated to the subject of recovery-rate estimation and the relationship between default and RRs. This paper presents a detailed review of the way credit risk models, developed during the last 30 years, treat the RR and, more specifically, its relationship with the PD of an obligor.

Some observers argue that external shocks, including a drop in aggregate demand and a shortage of working capital, explain the corporate sector's poor performance. Others assert that the difficulties were apparent well before the crisis and that the risky financial policies pursued by these firms left them vulnerable. A survey of the literature shows little microeconomic evidence to support either view. This article compares the growth and financing patterns of East Asian corporations in the years before the crisis with those in other countries. It finds little microeconomic evidence that corporate growth was weakening but some support for the argument that many firms had a weak financial structure that left them vulnerable to an economic downturn. Based on a sample of more than 850 publicly listed firms in the four crisis countries-Indonesia, Malaysia, the Republic of Korea, and Thailand-and two comparators, Hong Kong (China) and Singapore, it appears that firm-specific weaknesses already in existence before the crisis were important factors in the deteriorating performance of the corporate sector.","","(East); (Southeast); Asia; corporate strategy; financial crisis; industrial performance","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0034040429"

The arguments focus on a specific case in point: the behavioral theory of organizational decline and the economic modeling of immediate exit. The arguments come in three steps. First, the literature on organizational decline is reviewed by organizing a framework that summarizes arguments from varying economic and organizational perspectives that have, for the most part, developed independently. Observations from empirical and theoretical studies are combined in order to investigate the causes, conditions, courses, and consequences of organizational downturn. Second, a theoretical argument is developed that explains voluntary exit and chronic failure by introducing a proxy of organizational inertia in a model of strategic Cournot duopoly. The key assumptions, which have a behavioral flavour that seemingly contradicts orthodox economics, are grounded in the theoretical and empirical literatures. The results of the model support the claim that ""pure profit maximizing behavior may be at the expense of organizational survival"" (D'Aveni 1990, p. 135). Third, by formulating two hypotheses and presenting tentative evidence from the chemical industry, the paper hopes to convincingly argue that such integrative models lead to empirical testing of interesting hypotheses. A key finding here is that inefficient firms may outlast their efficient rivals (cf. D'Aveni 1989a).","Game Theoretical Modeling and Nonprofit Maximizing Behavior; Organizational Decline","Competition; Game theory; Industrial economics; Marketing; Mathematical models; Strategic planning; Cournot duopoly; Organizational decline; Organizational inertia; Management science","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0032045741"

Commonly portrayed as rooted in the national economic downturn and functionally undifferentiated, this paper demonstrates that large-scale encampments are rather shaped by urban policies and serve varied and even contradictory roles in different localities. Drawing on interviews and observations in 12 encampments in eight municipalities, this study reveals four distinctive socio-spatial functions of encampments shaped by administrative strategies of city officials and adaptive strategies of campers. I demonstrate how large-scale encampments paradoxically serve as both tools of containing homeless populations for the local state and preferred safe grounds for those experiencing homelessness. The paper concludes with a discussion on the implications of homeless seclusion for social analysis and policy, arguing that exclusion and seclusion are two sides of the same coin of the management of marginality in the American city. La Nueva Lógica de Reclusión de los Campamentos de Personas Sin Techo: Un Estudio Comparativo de Campamentos a Gran Escala de Personas Sin Techo en el Oeste de Estados Unidos: Resumen Desde los finales de los 90, algunas ciudades norteamericanas han sido testigo por primera vez desde La Gran Depresión del resurgimiento de campamentos a gran escala de personas sin techo. Comúnmente retratados como enraizados en la recesión económica nacional y como indiferenciados funcionalmente, este artículo demuestra que estos campamentos a gran escala son formados por políticas urbanas y que cumplen roles variados e incluso contradictorios en lugares distintos. En base a entrevistas y observación en doce campamentos en ocho municipalidades, este estudio revela cuatro funciones socio-espaciales típicas de campamentos formados por estrategias administrativas de oficiales de la ciudad y estrategias adaptativas de los acampadores. Demuestro cómo campamentos a gran escala paradójicamente sirven tanto como instrumentos para contener a personas sin techo para el gobierno local y como lugares seguros para los que experimentan el no tener hogar. El artículo concluye con una discusión sobre las implicancias del auge de la reclusión de las personas sin techo para el análisis social y las políticas públicas, y se argumenta que la exclusión y reclusión son dos caras de la misma moneda de las tácticas disciplinarias de control social. © 2014 American Sociological Association.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84919654149"

Lynne Hamill and Nigel Gilbert, Centre for Research in Social Simulation (CRESS), University of Surrey, UK. New methods of economic modelling have been sought as a result of the global economic downturn in 2008.This unique book highlights the benefits of an agent-based modelling (ABM) approach. It demonstrates how ABM can easily handle complexity: heterogeneous people, households and firms interacting dynamically. Unlike traditional methods, ABM does not require people or firms to optimise or economic systems to reach equilibrium. ABM offers a way to link micro foundations directly to the macro situation. Key features: Introduces the concept of agent-based modelling and shows how it differs from existing approaches. Provides a theoretical and methodological rationale for using ABM in economics, along with practical advice on how to design and create the models. Each chapter starts with a short summary of the relevant economic theory and then shows how to apply ABM. Explores both topics covered in basic economics textbooks and current important policy themes; unemployment, exchange rates, banking and environmental issues. Describes the models in pseudocode, enabling the reader to develop programs in their chosen language. Supported by a website featuring the NetLogo models described in the book. Agent-based Modelling in Economics provides students and researchers with the skills to design, implement, and analyze agent-based models.

The findings suggest different fund balance portions have marginal but nonetheless important effects on expenditures. © 2017 Wiley.

For a country which was once seen as emblematic of the process of African urbanisation, and was very often cited (erroneously) as being among the first in sub-Saharan Africa to have reached the stage where over half the population was urban, this is a dramatic shift. This paper has both an empirical and theoretical element. Empirically, it seeks to demonstrate the scale and pattern of the shift within Zambia through careful examination of census data which, although occasionally problematic, are generally sufficiently accurate to provide a basis for analysis. It is shown that counter-urbanisation is mainly characteristic of Copperbelt Province, but that other urban centres have also experienced a marked downturn in their growth rates. Changes in fertility and mortality rates have played a part, but the most important factor is shown to be shifts in migration patterns, with many centres clearly experiencing net out-migration, including that of some urban-born people, as a response to urban economic decline. These dynamics are also discussed theoretically in relation to longstanding debates in African urban studies about the implications of urbanisation and migration dynamics, which date back to the early days of the famous Rhodes-Livingstone Institute which was based in colonial Zambia. © 2005 The Editors of Urban Studies.","","Africa; Copperbelt; Eastern Hemisphere; Southern Africa; Sub-Saharan Africa; World; Zambia; counterurbanization; internal migration; population dynamics; urban population; urban-rural migration","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-17844397480"

Design/methodology/approach - A research project was carried out in 90 Greek food companies, using the questionnaire method. Two measurement models have been formulated. The first model includes the TQM philosophical elements and quality tools/techniques, while the second model includes the quality management benefits. Exploratory factor analyses are applied to extract the latent factors. The factors that significantly influence the quality management benefits are determined through multiple linear regression analyses. Findings - The analysis of the models confirms the binary character of TQM (the ""soft"" and ""hard"" TQM elements) in food companies and the existence of internal and external quality management benefits. The ""soft"" TQM elements have a significant direct impact on quality improvement, employee benefits and customer satisfaction. However, the impact of the ""hard"" TQM elements on the above quality management benefits is not direct but indirect, through their significant correlation with the ""soft"" TQM elements. Finally, quality improvement is also a significant factor that directly influences employee benefits, customer satisfaction and business performance. Research limitations/implications - The small size of the sample of the responding food companies, the diversity of these companies and the subjective character of the data collected are limitations that suggest future research recommendations. Practical implications - Food companies should realize the leading role of the ""soft"" aspect of TQM and the supporting role of the ""hard"" aspect in maximizing the quality management benefits and as a consequence in withstanding the current economic downturn. Originality/value - Focusing on ""quality-oriented"" food companies that have ample experience in quality and food safety management systems, the present study reveals a significant direct impact of the ""soft"" TQM elements and an indirect impact of the ""hard"" TQM elements on the quality management benefits. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Food companies; Quality management benefits; Soft and hard TQM elements","Customer satisfaction; Factor analysis; Linear regression; Philosophical aspects; Regression analysis; Total quality management; Business performance; Design/methodology/approach; Exploratory factor analysis; Food companies; Food safety management systems; Multiple linear regression analysis; Quality improvement; Total quality managements (TQM); Quality management","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84927562387"

As these measures are exhausted, non-COVID-19 related issues such as those associated with the mental and physical well-being of people under lockdowns became an emerging concern. As these issues are evident, not to mention the economic downturn, governments are currently looking at designing lockdown relaxation efforts by simultaneously considering both public health and economic restart. Without documented experiences to rely on, governments are resorting to trial-and-error approach in creating a lockdown exit strategy while preventing succeeding waves of cases that may overwhelm healthcare facilities. Thus, this work pioneers the use of the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) method with intuitionistic fuzzy (IF) sets along with the domain of public health and the emerging COVID-19 pandemic. The DEMATEL handles the intertwined causal relationships among guideline protocols for the relaxation strategy. The intuitionistic fuzzy set theory addresses the vagueness and uncertainty of human judgments in the context of the DEMATEL. A case study of the Philippine government response for the lockdown exit is presented to evaluate the applicability of the proposed method. Findings reveal that compliance of minimum public health standards, limited movement of persons, suspension of physical classes, the prohibition of mass gatherings, non-operation of category IV industries, and non-operation of hotels or similar establishments are the most crucial protocols for such strategy. These findings offer practical insights for the government to allocate resources and impose measures to ensure their implementation, as well as for developing mitigation efforts to cushion their socio-economic impacts. Policy insights and avenues for future works are also discussed. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","COVID-19; DEMATEL; Intuitionistic fuzzy sets; Lockdown; Pandemic; Relaxed measures","Philippines; COVID-19; epidemic; fuzzy mathematics; health policy; local government; national security; numerical model; policy implementation; viral disease","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85087934956"

India's woolen knitwear industry, concentrated in Ludhiana, recently survived two crises-the collapse of its largest export market (the former Soviet Union), and the simultaneous opening up of the domestic market to freer trade. After an unusually short downturn, the cluster not only recovered rapidly, but is increasingly diversifying into more demanding and competitive external markets. Four factors are key to explaining this surprisingly resilient recovery. First, the best performing firms had a strong and simultaneous presence in dynamic segments of the domestic market alongside exports. This generated key organizational learning, and built managerial and production capacities that helped firms adapt quickly to more demanding markets later. Second, an important feature of the learning relationship between first-time exporters and their foreign buyers was the small-scale nature of contracts and a 'customization of fit' between the producer and the feedback-giving intermediary. Third, better performing firms paid equal if not greater attention to making organizational changes in their work practices than to the purchase of new equipment. Fourth, the embedded nature of production networks, and the government's past programs to assist local firms have indirectly helped create a dynamic middle-tier of locally-rooted exporters who appear to be leading the cluster's transformation and modernization.","","India; economic data; knitting industry; wool industry; clothing industry; manufactured export; manufacturing","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0032847685"

Rural migrants moving to urbanized areas serve as a floating labour pool, providing flexible and cheap labour for urbanization and industrialization processes (increasingly over the past three decades). During periods of slow economic development, however, there is a pattern of return migration from the urban back to the rural. Over the last decade, older rural migrants, or first-generation migrants, tend to return to their home villages periodically, during times of economic downturn, but this does not imply that migration to cities has decreased. Younger people from rural villages continue to migrate to the city in search of urban economic opportunities and to escape rural poverty, regardless. The purpose of this paper, then, is to explore the intentions and context of floating migrants’ decisions to return “home” or to remain in the city. This research examines how notions of gender, age and sense of belonging affect the choice of rural migrants to stay or return, including different calculations in the decision-making process across age and gender. The question of whether to stay or return is framed through the lens of belonging, which allows us to explore the changing priorities of a younger generation of floating migrants. Based on fieldwork in Shanghai and Anhui, we find that the floating workers interviewed prefer to remain in mega-cities as opposed to smaller cities or returning home to rural areas. The findings contextualize the residential dilemmas facing floating migrants, and points to different factors across age in deciding whether to stay in the city, or return to the village during economic slumps. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Belonging; Hukou; Rural migrants; Urban settlement","Anhui; China; Shanghai; decision making; human settlement; megacity; migrant worker; return migration; rural-urban migration; urban area; young population","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85007422314"

This study tests this hypothesis, especially in reference to the current global economic crisis, by drawing lessons from the Asian crisis of 1997, for which relevant data are available. The study pertains specifically to the case of Japanese family and non-family companies. The empirical investigation uses a matched pair methodology, which allows for strong controls of size and industry variables. The sample consists of 98 carefully selected pairs (one family and one non-family) of firms that are of the same size and from the same industry.

One perspective is to focus on the guiding beliefs and values of the People's Action Party (PAP) governing elite and its nature of state governance since its assumption of power in 1959; it has ruled the state continuously since then. Its success in turning Singapore into a modern metropolis the envy of many has helped to buttress and legitimise its rule. Despite the growing criticisms, especially by the opposition parties, of the highly regulated manner by which the country has been managed, the PAP government, led by its first and former prime minister Lee Kuan Yew, and now by Goh Chok Tong, has unrepentantly stuck to its long-held world-view and governing paradigm. To the government, Singapore's rapid economic growth and political stability could not have been achieved if the country were to follow the Western liberal democratic path and its attendant notions of development. While gradually allowing for greater citizen participation in the formulation of policies in more recent times, the present leadership, mindful of opening up a Pandora's box, is still cautiously wary of the growth of a more pluralistic political environment; hence, its preference for what can be described as an illiberal, (soft) authoritarian democratic culture. Given this particular regime mindset and its parameters of governance, it is indeed a Herculean task for Opposition parties to make any significant inroads in the Republic's future politics. However, all may not be lost for opposition parties and for those aspiring to see the evolution of a civil society.

The growth of the gig economy has been partly attributed to technological advancements that enable flexible work environments. In this study, we consider the role of an alternative driver, economic downturns, and associated financial stressors in the offline economy, for example, unemployment. As the exact nature of the relationship between online labor supply and offline unemployment is not immediately clear, in this work, we seek to quantify the relationship, exploring heterogeneity across a variety of county-specific characteristics. We study these relationships in the context of a leading online labor market, combining data on the participation of workers residing in counties across the United States with county-level data on unemployment from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Our results demonstrate a positive and significant association between local (county) unemployment in the traditional offline labor market and the supply of online workers residing in the same county, as well as significantly larger volumes of online project bidding activity from workers in the same county. Specifically, we estimate that a 1% increase in county unemployment is associated with a 21.8% increase in the volume of county residents actively working online at the platform. Furthermore, our results suggest significant heterogeneity in the relationship, such that a significantly larger supply of online labor manifests when unemployment occurs in counties characterized by better internet access, younger and more educated populations, and populations whose social ties are dispersed over a wider geographic area. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications for workers, online labor markets, and policy makers.

This paper examines the use of contagion as a model for assessing the dynamics of both episodes: the spread of infection and the diffusion of shock through an intrafinancial system. The argument is put that a discourse of globally emerging and re-emerging infection helped to shape a theory of financial contagion, which developed, particularly from 1997, in relation to financial crises in emerging markets in Southeast Asia. Conversely, concerns about the economic impact of a global pandemic have been influential in shaping public health responses to communicable diseases from the early 1990s. The paper argues that tracing the conceptual entanglement of financial and biological contagions is important for understanding the interconnected global environment within which risk is increasingly being evaluated. The paper also considers the consequences of this analogizing for how financial crises are understood and, ultimately, how responses to them are formulated.

In the early 1990s, when the Italian carmaker was going through troubling times (along with many other players in the automotive industry), CEO Gian Carlo Michellone radically turned around CRF's organization and innovation strategy, adopting and mastering a strategic approach to innovation that resembles what would become known as the open innovation paradigm. This revolution allowed the Fiat Group to keep its ""innovation engine"" running, despite the heavy downturn of the industry. The CRF case demonstrates how open innovation can protect the firm's innovation capability from the risk of severe resource rationalizations during periods of crisis while proffering a starting point to replicate innovation capability once the downturn is over. The efforts to streamline the adoption of open innovation need to be targeted at several aspects of a firm's organization, i.e. the structures, organizational roles, the planning and control and performance management systems, corporate values, and individual competencies and attitudes. The role played by the senior executive leadership in promoting the successful implementation of open innovation is critical, especially during tough economic times.

The Fragile Families study collected the latest wave of data during the Great Recession, the worst recession since the Great Depression. The data provide a unique opportunity to examine how high unemployment affects the well-being of low-income families. This study finds that the unemployment rate is associated with increased overall material hardship, difficulty paying bills, having utilities disconnected, and increased usage of welfare, food stamps, unemployment insurance, and Medicaid.

Design/methodology/approach - The paper takes the approach of econometrics studies to gauge the impact of intellectual assets on national accounts and a stocktake of all existing initiatives, frameworks and guidelines relating to extra-financial corporate reporting on intellectual assets. Findings - The paper provides macro data on the contribution of investments in intellectual assets to productivity and economic growth in OECD countries and presents the challenges in terms of corporate reporting and corporate governance that result from the increasing importance of intellectual assets for growth and competitiveness. It then provides a stock-take of existing guidelines and frameworks in OECD countries that encourage companies to report on their intellectual assets and their strategies to create value. Practical implications - The paper provides policy recommendations to better understand the role of intellectual assets, improve their contribution to economic growth, and to enhance information on intellectual assets and the diffusion of good practices. Originality/value - The value of the paper is that it contributes to mitigating the difficulties to assess the contribution of intellectual assets on national accounts that is crucial to obtain an accurate picture of economic growth, downturns and investments. It also contributes to the debate on how to overcome the limits of accounting standards to recognize intellectual assets so as to improve companies' valuation and lower their cost of capital.","Competitive strategy; Corporate communications; Innovation; Intangible assets; Intellectual capital","","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-42549120084"

Focusing on television broadcasters in the UK, it analyses the recent migration of conventional media towards multi-platform strategies and asks whether digitization is making content delivery more resource-intensive than before or whether it is facilitating greater efficiency. Findings suggest that adaptation to a multi-platform outlook on the part of conventional media requires investment in staffing and re-versioning of content. Funding this, especially in a period of economic downturn, has encouraged a more selective approach towards content, with concomitant implications for diversity. Notwithstanding generally low commercial returns from online activities so far, the potential economic advantages to be had from multi-platform are significant. The experience of UK broadcasters suggests a well-executed '360-degree' approach to commissioning and distribution will increase the value that can be realized from any given universe of content, partly because of extended opportunities for consumption of that content, but also because modes of engagement in a digital multi-platform context allow for an improved audience experience and for better signalling of audience preferences back to suppliers. © The Author(s), 2010.","360-degree commissioning; cross-platform; economies of scale; economies of scope; multi-platform","","Review","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-78650546598"

At the start of this period there was considerable conformity in price levels among the eight centres, but by the mid-1990s wide disparity in the price structure had emerged, with Vancouver and Toronto (and their satellites) having broken away from the rest as a result of rapid price inflation after 1985. At the same time, the cities showing the most marked gains also suffered the heaviest losses during economic downturns. The geography and timing of rapid- price inflation coincided with the onset of heavy and concentrated immigration in Toronto and Vancouver after 1985, and the remainder of the paper considers the relations in these cities between price change and globalisation in general, immigration in particular. In both cities, and especially Vancouver, aside from growth in the provincial GDP, conventional regional and national factors seem to have declining significance in accounting for price movements, while indicators of globalisation, including immigration, exert stronger effects. These effects are consistent not only with globalisation but also with economic polarisation in post-industrial cities.","Gateway cities; Globalisation; House prices; Immigration","Canada; globalization; housing market; immigration; price dynamics; urban economy","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0035082654"

We find that Spanish banks use loan loss provisions to smooth earnings but we find no evidence that they practice capital management. We also find that credit risk variables weigh more and net operating income weighs less as determinants of generic and specific loan loss provisions after the introduction of the statistical provision than they did before this provision was introduced.

Recently, with their diminishing informational role combined with the economic downturn, libraries have had to reassert their relevance to communities in a period of severely reduced municipal budgets. One role that is often assumed but rarely examined in depth is the library as a generator of social capital. This preliminary study investigates the relationship between public libraries and indicators of social capital using a questionnaire survey administered in three branch libraries in a large Midwestern American city. Library users had significantly higher levels of social capital in terms of community involvement and trust than a random sample of city residents. When frequency of library use was correlated with indicators of social capital there were mixed results. Library use was significantly associated with community involvement, but not with trust. Lack of trust in neighbors may be the incentive for people to become more involved in their communities in order to create a safer environment. The findings suggest that there is a strong relationship between public libraries and social capital but that further research is needed to broaden the base of the study and to include interviews with library patrons and staff so as to get a more nuanced view of how social capital is created. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

This paper quantitatively assesses the potential of government investments in eco-friendly construction projects to boost the economy and simultaneously realise environmental gains through reduced energy consumption and related greenhouse gas emissions. The analysis uses a Computable General Equilibrium model that examines the macroeconomic impact of the COVID-19 crisis in a small open economy (Belgium). Subsequently, the impact of the proposed policy is assessed through comparative analysis for macroeconomic parameters as well as CO2 equivalent emissions for four scenarios. Our findings demonstrate that the COVID-19 pandemic damages economies considerably, however, the reduction in emissions is less than proportionate. Still, well-designed public policies can reverse this trend, achieving both economic growth and a disproportionally large decrease in emissions. Moreover, the positive effect of such a decoupling policy on GDP is even stronger during the pandemic than compared to the pre-COVID-19 period. This is the result of a targeted, investment-induced green transition towards low energy-intensive economic activities. Finally, this paper describes how the net effect on the government budget is positive through the indirect gains of the economic uptake. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","CGE model; Climate change; COVID-19; Economic recession; Greenhouse gas emissions; Pandemic; Policy analysis; Recovery plans; Small open economy; Sustainable investment","World; Budget control; Economic and social effects; Economics; Energy utilization; Greenhouse gases; Investments; Military operations; Public policy; Comparative analysis; Computable general equilibrium model; Eco-friendly construction; Economic activities; Economic downturn; Government investment; Green transitions; Macroeconomic impact; economic conditions; emission; green economy; greenhouse gas; Gross Domestic Product; macroeconomics; policy approach; virus; Gas emissions","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85087816715"

One of these studies was a detailed geological mapping of the late Quaternary alluvium and soils in the area. Dated by means of thorium-uranium disequilibria, archaeological finds, and historical information, seven periods of alluviation were identified, each of short duration relative to long intervening periods of stability and soil formation. The three earliest alluvial phases, falling before and during the last glacial interval, range from about 330,000 to 32,000 years in age. No alluviation accompanied the last glacial maximum around 20,000 years ago. In fact, a stable landscape persisted until about 4500 years ago, when debris flows and widespread aggradation in the valleys resulted from major slope destabilization and soil erosion, probably as a result of extensive land clearance in the Early Bronze Age. A subsequent stable period lasted through the many upheavals of the later Bronze Age, the Dark Ages, and the early historical period. It came to an end with a brief phase of alluviation between about 300 and 50 BC. Stability returned through the late Roman period, notwithstanding considerable expansion of the settled area. Another period of destabilization, this one marked by debris flows and hence major soil erosion, is poorly fixed in time, but probably coincides with expanded maquis clearance accompanying the resettlement of the area around AD 1000. Subsequent events of soil erosion and aggradation vary in nature and timing from one drainage to the next and, in some areas, continue today. Nature and chronology of the soil forming and alluviation events show that simple correlations with climatic events do not suffice to explain them. For the latter ones, past about 2500 BC, human activity seems to be the dominant cause, but once again the relation between cause and effect is not straightforward. Land clearing, or neglect of soil conservation efforts during economic downturns, appear to have a more devastating effect upon the landscape than do intensive land use or total land abandonment. © 1984.","geoarchaeology; geomorphology; Greece; holocene; land use; pleistocene; soils","geoarchaeology; geomorphology; Greece; Holocene.; land use; Pleistocene; soils","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0021617682"

However, the official poverty measure (OPM) does not account for the effect of near-cash transfers on the financial resources available to families, an important omission since such transfers have become an increasingly important part of government antipoverty policy. Applying the historical SPM, which does count such transfers, we find that trends in poverty have been more favorable than the OPM suggests and that government policies have played an important and growing role in reducing poverty-a role that is not evident when the OPM is used to assess poverty. We also find that government programs have played a particularly important role in alleviating child poverty and deep poverty, especially during economic downturns. © 2015 by the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management.","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84930574351"

When the growth target size of cities exceeds that of higher-level governments or if governments overfulfill their growth target tasks, then public service expenditure will decrease. We interpret the empirical findings as evidence that promotion evaluation based on economic performance distorts the composition of public expenditure, hinders sustainable economic development, and even accelerates the start of an economic downturn.

We argue that when whites perceive threats to their relative advantage in the racial status hierarchy, their resentment of minorities increases. This increased resentment in turn leads whites to withdraw support for welfare programs when they perceive these programs to primarily benefit minorities. Analysis of American National Election Studies data and two survey-embedded experiments support this reasoning. In Study 1, we find that whites' racial resentment increased beginning in 2008, the year of Barack Obama's successful presidential candidacy and a major economic downturn, the latter a factor previously shown to amplify racial threat effects. At the same time, whites' opposition to welfare increased relative to minorities'. In Study 2, we sought to better establish the causal effect of racial status threats. We found that experimentally presenting information suggesting that the white majority is rapidly declining increased whites' opposition to welfare, and this effect was mediated by heightened racial resentment. Finally, in Study 3 we found that threatening whites' sense of their economic advantage over minorities led whites to report greater opposition to welfare programs, but only if these programs were portrayed as primarily benefiting minorities, not if they were portrayed as benefiting whites. These findings suggest that whites' perceptions that minorities' standing is rising can produce periods of ""welfare backlash"" in which adoption of policies restricting or curtailing welfare programs is more likely. © The Author(s) 2018.

Given the economic benefits of helping, it seems important that, during difficult economic periods, the amount of helping does not decline. Yet, in this research, we propose and show that it does. We argue that cues that signal the economy is performing poorly prompt a construal that the success of one person implies less success for others. This zero-sum construal of success in turn makes employees less inclined to help. Four studies found evidence consistent with our theory. Study 1 found that worse economic periods are associated with a more zero-sum construal of success, using data from 59,694 respondents surveyed across 51 countries and 17 years and objective indicators of their macroeconomic environments. Studies 2 and 3 experimentally induced the perception that the U.S. economy was performing poorly with a sample of U.S. employees and found that this perception led employees to have a more zero-sum construal of success and made them less inclined to help. Study 4 was an unobtrusive experiment carried out among freelance professionals from 47 countries, and it found that participants' perception that the economy in their country was in a downturn was associated with a more zero-sum construal of success and less helping behavior.

We empirically investigate the performance of firms with powerful CEOs when industry conditions deteriorate. We focus on industry downturns as these represent an exogenous shock to a firm's environment and on settings in which CEO power and access to quality information is likely more consequential: innovative firms, firms with relatively little related-industry board expertise, firms operating in competitive industries, and firms operating in industries characterized by relatively greater managerial discretion.

This paper modifies previous models by adding on-the-job search, which leads to an additional sullying effect. Calibration of the model suggests this offsetting sullying effect is likely to be much larger than the cleansing effect, and can account for the procyclical match quality we observe in the data.","","economic conditions; employment; job search; labor market; labor productivity","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0036183121"

Although some authors invoke the socialization of citizens under authoritarian regimes as a cause, others hint at the fact that these countries still experience corruption, lack of good governance and low levels of economic development. In this article, we test both theoretical claims, by conducting a multilevel analysis on the full sample of the European Social Survey in the period 2002-2008, introducing a distinction between institutionalized and non-institutionalized forms of participation. The analysis demonstrates that, controlling for all relevant individual level characteristics, an authoritarian legacy, the perception of corruption, bad governance and low income levels have a negative impact on participation levels. Controlling for corruption levels and lack of good governance, the effect of an authoritarian legacy is rendered non-significant. An analysis by age and cohort suggests that the effect of current experiences with corruption are more powerful than the effect of an authoritarian legacy. As such, our findings support the claim that especially bad governance and corruption have a strong negative impact on civic engagement in Central and Eastern Europe. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.","Central and Eastern Europe; corruption; democratic transition; European Social Survey; political participation; political socialization","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84893977460"

While the sharing economy may contribute to addressing sustainability issues, its actual economic, social and environmental impacts remain poorly understood. Advancing more sustainably promising forms of sharing and leveraging its benefits, while circumventing its pitfalls, is becoming increasingly important in the era of Covid-19 and climate crisis, economic downturn and uncertainty, and loss of social connectedness, particularly in anonymous urban environments. The ways to capitalise on strengths of the sharing economy are still poorly understood. In particular, the roles and perspectives of users, businesses and municipal governments in institutionalising the sharing economy in various geographical contexts are essential to examine. This volume seeks to advance the research field by focusing on four research areas: 1) understanding the sharing economy conceptually; 2) user perspectives on the sharing economy; 3) business perspective on the sharing economy; and 4) urban governance perspective on the sharing economy. The twenty articles in this volume discuss sustainability implications of the sharing economy from different perspectives, in various geographical contexts, and drawing on a range of disciplines. The volume makes a significant contribution by bringing in empirical findings from emerging and developing economies, including Brazil, China, Indonesia, Poland, the Philippines, South Korea, Thailand and Vietnam, thereby supplementing more frequently discussed perspectives from high-income countries.

Even in highly developed and densely populated countries, such regions and settlements are scarred by economic decline and demographic shrinking, leading to a spatial form of inequalities that can be described as “peripheralisation”. The discourse on peripheralisation processes is relatively new. It was introduced by the German sociologist Karl-Dieter Keim (2006), who identified the socio-spatial decoupling of rural areas from the dominant processes of centralisation and the weakening of economic potential as central features of peripheralisation. In this paper Keim's approach is applied to analyse and to compare the current situation in two small towns that have experienced serious population decline from about 10,000 (1965) to about 4000 inhabitants (2015): Johanngeorgenstadt in Germany and Ōya in Japan. Although the course of regional policy in the two countries has differed to some extent, processes of peripheralisation have been similar in the two towns, including tendencies of economic downturn and a loss of original functions. Against this backdrop, the main finding of the paper is that market-oriented strategies like neoliberal austerity policy or a Keynesian approach have not yielded the expected positive results in the past and cannot be viewed as the remedy for small towns in decline as seen here. Since endogenous development approaches also did not play a major role in either case, it is concluded that strategies negating quantitative growth like Slow City and Life Beyond Growth, which focus on quality-of-life factors, well-being and deceleration, could be a viable alternative. However, more cross-country comparative research on peripheralisation processes and their connection with socio-economic decline in small towns amidst demographic change seems to be necessary. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Demographic change; Development strategies; Regional policy; Rural areas","Germany; Japan; development strategy; peripheral region; population decline; regional policy; rural area; socioeconomic impact","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84979779081"

Following are some of the key findings. First, the data analysis indicated a significant long-term positive link between negative shocks to innovation in environmental-related technologies and carbon dioxide emissions during the economic downturn. Second, positive shocks to innovation in environmental-related technologies minimize carbon dioxide emissions during the economic upturn. Third, the relationship between innovation shocks in environmental-related technologies and carbon dioxide emissions was counter-cyclical during business cycles. Fourth, impact of positive shocks to innovation in environmental-related technologies on carbon dioxide emissions was more than the impact of negative shocks to innovation in environmental-related technologies on carbon dioxide emissions. Fifth, increasing the export tax serve as an effective measure to mitigate carbon dioxide emissions. Sixth, an increase in exports, use of fossil fuels, and household consumption expenditures contributed to the carbon dioxide emissions.

Certainly, the Great Recession has influenced the financial well-being of older adults, but has it had discernible effects on mental health? Method: This study draws on 5,366 respondents from the Health and Retirement Study (2006-2010) to examine objective and subjective measures of financial well-being in the period surrounding the Great Recession. Guided by cumulative inequality theory, this research investigates whether the economic downturn contributed to worsening anxiety and depressive symptoms over a 4-year period. Results: Results from linear fixed effects models reveal that decreases in objective financial resources were associated with increased financial strain during the Great Recession. Unlike the objective indicators, however, financial strain was a strong and robust predictor of worsening mental health between 2006 and 2010. Discussion: Building on prior research, this study elucidates the factors that shape financial strain and provides evidence that the Great Recession not only affected the financial well-being of older adults but also had adverse effects on mental health. © The Author 2016","Financial strain; Great Recession; Mental health","Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cohort Studies; Economic Recession; Female; Health Behavior; Health Status; Humans; Male; Mental Health; Quality of Life; Resilience, Psychological; Retirement; Risk Factors; United States; aged; cohort analysis; economic recession; female; health behavior; health status; human; male; mental health; psychological resilience; psychology; quality of life; retirement; risk factor; statistics and numerical data; United States; very elderly","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85012987885"

They identify certain core similarities in the experiences of unemployed professionals and then discern three narrative strategies through which unemployed professionals tried to make sense of their dismissal and sustain their sense of selfhood. The term 'narrative coping' is proposed as a way of describing each unemployed professional's struggle to construct a story that offers both meaning and consolation. The study reveals that individuals expressing the most profound despair (those for whom job loss was the 'end of the line') were those whose stories had achieved 'closure'. By contrast, most of those who maintained more open-ended narratives were better able to contain their emotions, either by holding on to the belief that unemployment was a temporary career aberration or by abandoning the idea that life is the same as career and by moving on to a new stage of experimentation and bricolage akin to an identity moratorium. © The Author(s), 2010.","career narratives; identity; job loss; narrative coping; psychological trauma; storytelling methodology; unemployment","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-78650357468"

The diversity of participants as well as the occurrence of extreme socio-political events yields a market with complex price evolution. This paper uses entropy methods to monitor the evolution of crude oil price movements. As the complexity of the price can depend of the time horizon, entropy computations are performed for different time scales via low-pass filtering of the price difference dynamics. The results are interpreted in term of relative market efficiency concepts in the sense that high entropy values should be related to a more complex and, hence, less predictable market evolution. It is shown that the highest market efficiency is found for small time scales up to one or two weeks. The multiscale entropy pattern for high time scales, longer than one quarter, is interesting as it shows alternating periods of high and low entropy levels. Interestingly, this alternating pattern has a dominant spectral component of about 4.3. years, which could be related to macroeconomic (Kitchin) business cycles. It is shown that U.S. recessions in the recent 25. years are coincident with periods of reduced entropy levels, meaning that during economic downturn the long-run market complexity is drastically reduced. The possible effects of extreme events (e.g., Iraq War) are analyzed in terms of the relative market efficiency, suggesting that some events have affected the short-term but not the long-term market complexity. Overall, these results show that methods based on entropy concepts can shed light on the structure of crude oil markets as well as on its link to macroeconomic conditions and socio-political extreme events. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Crude oil; Economic recessions; Impact of extreme events; Multiscale entropy pattern","Commerce; Costs; Crude oil; Economics; Efficiency; Time measurement; Business cycles; Crude oil market; Crude oil prices; Different time scale; Economic downturn; Economic recessions; Entropy concept; Entropy methods; Entropy value; Extreme events; Iraq War; Low entropy; Low-pass filtering; Market efficiency; Market evolution; Multiscale entropy; Price difference; Price evolution; Price formation; Reduced entropy; Spectral components; Time horizons; Time-scales; business cycle; complexity; crude oil; economic conditions; energy market; macroeconomics; price dynamics; Entropy","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-80052159211"

This paper aims to examine the behavior of consumers, firms, and government in Turkey in response to the recent global economic crisis. Turkey was one of the few countries that emerged from the economic downturn relatively quickly. The demographics of consumers, the solidity of financial sector, and the government policies led to a speedy recovery from the crisis through an increase in consumption expenditures. During the initial shock, consumers switched to cheaper goods and decreased consumption expenditures in total. The government emphasized that the impact of crisis would be limited. The opening of credit lines, the temporary reduction in value-added tax and special consumption tax on certain commodities, aggressive marketing campaigns, and a rosy future drawn by chambers of commerce and NGOs in specific promotional activities were influential in increasing consumption.

In the UK, it has led to sharp falls in labour demand in many sectors of the economy and to initial acute labour shortages in other sectors. Much more than in a typical downturn, the current crisis is not simply a general slowdown in economic activity but also a radical short-term shift in the mix of economic activities – of which an unknown, but possibly significant, amount will be persistent. The initial policy response has focused on cushioning the blow to families’ finances and allowing the majority of workers and firms to resume their original activities once the crisis subsides. These are crucial priorities. But there should also be a focus on reallocating some workers, either temporarily if working in shut-down sectors or permanently by facilitating transitions to sectors and jobs offering better prospects and facing labour shortages. The phasing-out of the furlough subsidies, which is projected to happen in Autumn 2020, brings this into even sharper focus since the alternative for many workers will be unemployment. Active labour market policy will need to be front and centre. © 2020 The Authors.

Particularly, it sheds some light on those factors that turn a social innovation initiative into a success, both in terms of meeting social needs and achieving economic sustainability. Design/methodology/approachBy using a grounded theory approach, an inductive comparative case study is conducted. Two work integration social enterprises in the hospitality and tourism sector are selected. Both companies are located in Barcelona (Spain) under the same legal regulation and economic situation and initially run a manufacturing business. Due to the economic crisis they were forced to reinvent themselves to survive. Data were collected from different sources and coded using content analysis procedures. FindingsResults indicate that three factors, namely, value proposition, appropriate market research and stakeholder involvement, heavily contributed to firm’s success, corroborating previous studies. Furthermore, our study reveals that social need pressures and managerial trust on employees are additional factors that drive social business model innovation. Practical implicationsChanges in the demand, the rules governing the market or economic downturns are external drivers for demand-pull innovations. In such context, firms need to reformulate their business models if they wish to survive. Acknowledging the factors that help firms overcome these obstacles is of great interest for both academics and entrepreneurs. Originality/valueSocial innovation in business models is a topic still poorly defined in the literature, yet, its boundaries to other fields are still fuzzy. This paper aims to fulfill this gap by presenting the theoretical domain in which this topic fits in and evidencing those successful factors that should be considered when designing and implementing a business model innovation which may help other firms facing a similar process. © 2016, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Hospitality and tourism sector; Social business models; Social enterprises; Social innovation","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84975038269"

Our results suggest that first, investors take into account the reliability of sustainability information when determining the market value of a company and second, the benefits of increased reliability of sustainability information vary cross-sectionally. More specifically, companies that carry higher risks for investors (e. g., higher systematic investment risk, higher financial leverage, and higher levels of opportunistic management behavior) react more strongly to an increase in the reliability of sustainability information. Finally, we show that the benefits of an increase in the reliability of sustainability information are higher in times of economic uncertainty (e. g., during economic downturns and generally high stock price volatilities). © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Corporate social responsibility; Event study; Market reactions; Reliability; Sustainability","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84859848909"

Recent research on wage cyclicality has suggested that wages are very procyclical (tending to rise and fall with economic upturns and downturns), even for workers who remain with the same employer. The author finds, however, that the evidence for wage procyclicality within the matches he examines is rather weak except for the small group of workers who were paid by piece rate or commissions. Despite having acyclical wage rates, men who were paid hourly had earnings movements that were very procyclical. Salaries exhibited little cyclicality, but salaried workers who had income sources from bonuses, commissions, or overtime had procyclical earnings. The results suggest that the increasing prevalence of incentive-based pay will increase the procyclicality of wages within matches.","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-0041077622"

The situation was reversed in the 1980s as a result of economic downturn in Brazil and labour shortages in Japan. This book examines the construction and reconstruction of the ethnic identities of people of Japanese descent, firstly in the process of emigration to Brazil up to the 1980s, and secondly in the process of return migration to Japan in the 1990s. The closed nature of Japan's social history means that the effect of return migration' can clearly be seen. Japan is to some extent a unique sociological specimen owing to the absence of any tradition of receiving immigrants. This book is first of all about migration, but also covers the important related issues of ethnic identity and the construction of ethnic communities. It addresses the issues from the dual perspective of Japan and Brazil. The findings suggest that mutual contact has led neither to a state of conflict nor to one of peaceful coexistence, but rather to an assertion of difference. It is argued that the Nikkeijin consent strategically to the social definitions imposed upon their identities and that the issue of the Nikkeijin presence is closely related to the emerging diversity of Japanese society. © 2003 Daniela de Carvalho.

Monitoring this dynamic at the population-level can be accomplished by examining not only rates of illness and mortality, but variability in rates, either between populations or within populations over time. We used mortality data from New York City neighborhoods between 1990 and 2001 to test two related hypotheses consistent with this model of population health: (a) There is greater variability in mortality rates at a point in time between neighborhoods that are characterized by socioeconomic vulnerability; and (b) there is greater variability in mortality rates over time within neighborhoods that are characterized by socioeconomic vulnerability. We found that neighborhoods characterized by social and economic vulnerability displayed substantial variability in particular mortality rates. Mortality rates displaying the greatest variability were from causes that may be sensitive to social conditions (e.g., homicide or HIV/AIDS rates). Variability in population health existed both between neighborhoods with underlying vulnerability at one point in time and within vulnerable neighborhoods over time. The results of this analysis are consistent with a theory of underlying socioeconomic vulnerabilities of human populations and suggest that variability in population health may be an important consideration in population health assessment. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The economic recession in 2020 is expected to be the most serious since the Second World War. This study aims to analyse the likely consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic crisis on entrepreneurship and new venture activity. Design/methodology/approach: The paper focuses first on the major shocks caused by the pandemic that may affect entrepreneurial activity. To do so, the authors briefly review the literature about the previous financial crisis and its effects on entrepreneurship. Then, the manuscript means to disentangle how these shocks will impinge on the different stages and motives within the entrepreneurial process. Findings: This analysis reveals that the consequences of the pandemic for entrepreneurship will be generally damaging, but they may not be so tremendously negative as originally thought. We could initially expect a broad downturn in entrepreneurial activity. Soon after that, however, necessity entrepreneurship is likely to boom. At the same time, but to a lesser extent, high-potential entrepreneurial activity could also be fostered, provided the recovery is quick and there is sufficient support from the environment and institutions. Originality/value: This is probably one of the first academic reflections on the likely effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on entrepreneurship. It specifically addresses the role of institutions and how they may differently affect necessity and opportunity entrepreneurship. It also suggests interesting related research areas and some basic recommendations on how to help entrepreneurs overcome it. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Covid-19; Crisis; Entrepreneurship; High-quality entrepreneurship; Necessity entrepreneurship; Opportunity entrepreneurship; Pandemic; Potential entrepreneurs; Shock","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85096551905"

Over recent years there has been a push to develop more explicit evidence-based priority-setting processes, which aim to be transparent and inclusive in their approach and a number of analytical tools and sources of evidence have been developed and utilised at national and local levels. This paper reports findings from a qualitative research study which investigated local priority-setting activity across five English Primary Care Trusts, between March and November 2012. Findings demonstrate the dual aims of local decision-making processes: to improve the overall effectiveness of priority-setting (i.e. reaching 'correct' resource allocation decisions); and to increase the acceptability of priority-setting processes for those involved in both decision-making and implementation. Respondents considered priority-setting processes to be compartmentalised and peripheral to resource planning and allocation.

Taking as illustrations the cases of Spain, France, Austria, Belgium and Germany, this article examines how regularization policies frame work. Employment provisions follow a civic-performance frame that breaks with the criterion of vulnerability. While secure forms of employment paying standard wages are privileged, the crisis has made such jobs even less accessible to migrants seeking to regularize or maintain their status. Residence permits granted through legalization have become increasingly temporary and conditional, often involving repeated transitions in and out of illegality. A vicious circle of ""disintegration"" thus threatens to set in where employment precariousness becomes both the source and the consequence of legal precariousness. Policy Implications: The article shows how employment provisions are tightly linked to policies of ""earned legalization"". The article shows that employment can be part of a broader regularization policy emphasizing ties to the host country. The article brings attention to potential conflicts between access requirements based on migrant vulnerability, and those based on migrant integration. The article warns against the exclusionary workings of employment-based regularization in times of economic downturn. © 2013 IOM.","","Austria; Belgium; France; Germany; Spain; economic conditions; employment; immigrant population; labor migration; labor policy; regulatory framework; vulnerability","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84888136975"

Using a large panel of US companies over the 1980 to 2011 period, I find a robust empirical relation between R&D and distress risk, primarily among financially constrained firms. Moreover, the effect of R&D on distress risk is magnified during economic downturns.

In our analysis, we examine how the unemployment rate affects retirement and whether the Social Security (SS) system and Unemployment Insurance (UI) system influence how older workers respond to labor market shocks. We use pooled cross-sectional data from the March Current Population Survey (CPS) in our analysis. We find that downturns in the labor market increase retirement transitions and that the magnitude of this effect is comparable to that associated with moderate changes in financial incentives to retire and to the threat of a health shock facing older workers. Interestingly, retirements only increase in response to an economic downturn once workers become SS-eligible, suggesting that retirement benefits may help to alleviate the income loss associated with a weak labor market. We also estimate the impact of UI generosity on retirement and find little consistent evidence of an effect. This suggests that in some ways SS may serve as a more effective form of unemployment insurance for older workers than UI. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

We study the mobility patterns among three states, formal sector employment, informal sector work, and not working, and analyze how these patterns vary across groups with different characteristics and family resources. We use data from Mexico's quarterly Urban Employment Survey. We focus on eight panel waves drawn in 1999-2000 but also compare these with estimates for panels covering 1992-93 and 1994-95. The period 1992-93 was a time of steady economic growth; the 1994-95 period is characterized by the economic downturn after the peso crisis. After some years of recovery, the 1999-2000 period is again characterized by economic growth. It seems interesting to compare the results for these three time periods, particularly since the nature of the difference between the formal and informal sector may have changed because of institutional reforms and the growth of foreign-owned in-bond manufacturing industries. The model estimates are used to predict the probabilities of changing from one state to another for benchmark individuals with given observed and unobserved characteristics. These predicted probabilities are used to test the null hypothesis that the transition patterns between sectors are in line with the symmetric view of formal and informal sector jobs. To be precise, we show that the null hypothesis that formal and informal sector jobs have the same entry and access rates implies restrictions on the state probabilities and the transition rates for both sectors. On the basis of our model estimates, we test restrictions for the benchmark workers. © 2004 by The University of Chicago.

How can accountability mechanisms contribute to halting democratic erosion before breakdown, even if they could not prevent the onset of erosion? To study this question, we use the V-Dem Electoral Democracy Index to systematically identify three recent cases–Benin (2007–2012), Ecuador (2008–2010), and South Korea (2008–2016)–where substantial democratic erosion happened but democracy did not break down. Studying these cases in depth we find that accountability mechanism–parliamentary and judicial oversight (horizontal accountability), pressures from civil society and the media (diagonal accountability), or electoral competition between parties and within parties (vertical accountability)–played a part in halting democratic erosion in all of them. They effectively halted erosion when institutional constraints–such as presidential term limits or judicial independence–and contextual factors–in particular economic downturns and public outrage about corruption scandals–worked together to create simultaneous pressures on the incumbents from civil society and from vertical or horizontal accountability actors. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","accountability; autocratization; backsliding; Benin; Democracy; democratization; Ecuador; South Korea","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85104407695"

While numerous policy prescriptions for regional growth that built on this phenomenon have been devised, none has enjoyed more popularity among policy makers than the ""cluster"" based economic development strategy put forward by Harvard Business School's Michael Porter. In Porter's views, clusters are made up of firms that are linked in some ways and that are geographically proximate. Upon closer examination, however, this concept turns out to be so fuzzy that it is now commonly used in a variety of ways by a wide array of academics, consultants and policy makers. It is further argued that the regional specialization strategy commonly associated with clusters makes regions more likely to experience economic downturns, prevents the spontaneous creation of inter-industry linkages and hampers the creation of new ideas and businesses.","Cluster; Industrial districts; Industrial policy; Michael Porter; Regional development","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-4043111918"

This data is complemented with a survey of resilience related governance and organizational practices in 41 EOBs and 22 non-EOBs. Our results show that: (a) employee ownership that is combined with employee involvement in firm governance is associated with greater stability in business performance over a business cycle; (b) EOBs have longer investment payback horizon when compared to non-EOBs across a number of activities; (c) Top management in EOBs are more likely to seek employee input in strategic decision making; (d) EOBs are more likely to use employee involvement to achieve tighter coupling between feedback from operations and the setting of strategic direction for the firm.

The object of research is financial indicators of different Lithuanian economic sectors. The proposed procedure for multi-criteria comparison of economic sectors encompasses: 1) the indicator system, 2) application of fuzzy MCDM methods, and 3) inter-sectoral comparison based on ranks provided by fuzzy MCDM methods. The research covers period of 2007-2010, starting at the very beginning of the economic recession and, hopefully, ending with the upcoming recovery. The application of the three MCDM methods was successful. The results suggested the best performing sector being that of forestry and logging. Furthermore, enterprises operating in trade sector, hospitality sector, mining and quarrying sector, information sector, or manufacturing sector can be considered as working more efficiently than an average Lithuanian enterprise. At the other end of spectrum, construction, real estate, and transportation sectors were those severely damaged by the economic crisis: they were ranked below the average alternative. Meanwhile, relatively low positions of utilities sectors may be caused by their specifics. Finally, the transport sector can be considered as the typical victim of economic downturn. © 2012 Copyright Vilnius Gediminas Technical University (VGTU) Press Technika.","ARAS strategic management; economic sectors; financial ratios; fuzzy number; Lithuania; strategic management; TOPSIS; VIKOR","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84866320490"

We use two sets of panel data for seventeen states spanning a thirty-eight year period to test these hypotheses. When state heterogeneity is controlled for properly, our results show that a strong link exists between industrial diversity and reduced unemployment.

Literature on the resource-based view, the best-fit perspective and resource dependency theory is used to frame a qualitative study of nine global pharmaceutical firms that explores how multiple actors view GTM during the global downturn. The study investigates how actors perceive the strategic priorities of the firm during the downturn; the challenges of aligning GTM to address these priorities; the values of top management in supporting investment in GTM and the challenges encountered in coordinating and controlling GTM processes. The findings reveal that actors considered GTM to be strategically important because it enabled firms to simultaneously manage downsizing, expansion and structural alignment, and it helped them to prepare for growth in the future. Multi national companies exercised control and coordination of GTM during the global downturn through increased use of structural reporting, greater involvement of headquarter (HQ) and regional HQ in subsidiary talent decisions, networking and cognitive control strategies.

This existential threat, together with their crucial role in the economy, is the reason for the plethora of public financial support schemes being implemented throughout the entire world. However, support schemes for mental health are lacking. We aim to investigate, first, whether burnout levels have increased during the crisis and, second, whether burnout levels during the COVID-19 crisis depend on the threat of becoming ill, having to stay at home due to the lockdown, and/or having to file for bankruptcy due to the economic downturn. We do so using seven data sets of French entrepreneurs with a temporal comparison of averages and two data sets of French entrepreneurs with a cross-sectional analysis of individuals. Our findings show that indeed, the risks of burnout have increased during the pandemic and that the threat of bankruptcy is the dominant threat. As an increasing number of studies in the entrepreneurship literature indicate that entrepreneurs’ mental health influences their activities, as well as the growth and sustainability of their ventures, our study is important and timely in its contribution, as it takes a close look at the perception of burnout in general and more specifically during the COVID-19 pandemic. Plain English Summary: The risk of burnout in French entrepreneurs has increased significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic, which calls for not only financial support but also other forms of support. The COVID-19 pandemic presents many threats for entrepreneurs since their business survival is often directly at stake. These threats are not just financial but also related to health, such as the threat of burnout. The findings of our study show that for French entrepreneurs, the threat of burnout increased after the arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic. This finding raises the question whether this outcome is due to the threat to health, the effects of the lockdown, or the threat of bankruptcy. It appears that all three factors play important roles, although the financial threat is the dominant threat. These findings call for the extension of entrepreneurial support systems beyond the financial area by also involving an “entrepreneurship care” aspect, which includes telephone support, webinars, and mental help facilities. © 2021, The Author(s).","Burnout; COVID-19 pandemic; Entrepreneurs; France; Small business owners","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85107755259"

Firstly, to disentangle several debates with regard to regional economic resilience: What is it exactly? Which types can we distinguish? How can we operationalise it? And how can we conceptualise how it works? The second objective is to outline new directions for researching regional economic resilience. Thus far, research on regional economic resilience has been dominated by quantitative studies looking at how regional economies resisted and recovered from macro-economic downturns (especially the most recent one). I will argue that fruitful new directions are to be found in further developing evolutionary conceptions of regional economic resilience, especially in relation to structural changes in the wider economy. Such evolutionary conceptions do away with notions of equilibrium altogether and can thus encompass the complete transformation of regional economies. In terms of research focus, this entails homing in on the possible mechanisms through which the processes of reorganisation and reorientation take place within regional economies that undergo adaptation. And in terms of research methodology, this will require more research based on a comparative case study design, using a mix of quantitative and qualitative methods. © 2017 The Author(s) Geography Compass © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","","adaptive management; comparative study; macroeconomics; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; regional economy; structural change","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85028861571"

The COVID-19 pandemic has already imposed a heavy human cost—taken together, this public health crisis and its attendant economic downturn appear poised to dwarf the scope, scale, and disruptiveness of most modern pandemics. What evidence we do have about other modern pandemics is largely limited to short-run impacts. Consequently, recent experience can do little to help us anticipate and respond to COVID-19’s potential long-run impact on individuals over decades and even generations. History, however, offers a solution. Historical crises offer closer analogues to COVID-19 in each of its key dimensions—as a global pandemic, as a global recession—and offer the runway necessary to study the life-course and intergenerational outcomes. In this paper, we review the evidence on the long-run effects on health, labor, and human capital of both historical pandemics (with a focus on the 1918 Influenza Pandemic) and historical recessions (with a focus on the Great Depression). We conclude by discussing how past crises can inform our approach to COVID-19—helping tell us what to look for, what to prepare for, and what data we ought to collect now. © 2020","COVID-19; Early-life health; Human capital; Long-run effects; Pandemics; Public health; Recessions; Scarring","","Short survey","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85095818191"

With the number of migrant workers at a record high, the regulation of labour immigration is one of the most controversial public policy issues in high-income countries. A central question in these debates is how to link the admission of migrant workers to the 'needs' of the domestic labour market and national economy more generally. What these needs are, how they vary across sectors and occupations, and how they change during periods of economic growth and crisis are highly contested. A key theme is the importance of 'system effects' that 'produce' certain types of domestic labour shortages. Heavily influenced by the state, system effects arise from the institutional and regulatory frameworks of the labour market and from wider public policies (e.g. welfare policies), many of which are not ostensibly to do with the labour market hence the book's emphasis of the link between immigration and public policy more generally. The empirical chapters include quantitative analysis of the changing role of migrant workers, and in-depth examinations of demand for migrant workers in six sectors: health; social care; hospitality; food production; construction; and financial services. The book concludes with a comparative analysis of research and policy approaches to assessing labour shortages, with a particular focus on the potential lessons of the UK's Migration Advisory Committee (MAC), whose work has been heavily influenced by the research for this book, for current debates about immigration reform in the US. © Oxford University Press, 2013.","Economic downturn; Immigration; Labour shortages; Public policy","","Book","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84920114573"

This specification explains the observed persistence in individual and aggregate output fluctuations even in the presence of i.i.d shocks because individuals respond to the same shock differently depending on their recent past experience. The exact process for output, the sharpness of turning points and the degree of asymmetry are determined by the form of heterogeneity. Our general formulation, under certain assumptions, reduces to a number of popular state space (unobserved components) models. We find that on US data our general formulation performs better than many of the existing econometric models, largely because it allows sharper downturns and more pronounced asymmetries than linear models, and is smoother than discrete regime shift models. Our estimates imply that only modest intertemporal returns are needed for our model to explain US GNP, and that heterogeneity across agents plays an important role in the propagation of business cycle shocks. © 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

In contrast to existing evidence on bond maturities in economic downturns, we document that maturities exceed those of bonds issued before by the same firms as well as the average maturities during normal times. Determinants of corporate bond spreads substantially differ between COVID-19 and normal times. Most prominently, asset tangibility has a highly significant negative effect on spreads during normal times. During COVID-19, this is reversed, especially in industries heavily affected by lockdown measures, reflecting the inflexibility associated with fixed assets. A different picture emerges for equity issues, which slowed considerably during the first 4 weeks of the pandemic, before accelerating again. Capital raised during COVID-19 via equity issues is approximately 5% of capital raised via bond issues. © The Author(s) 2020.

The relations between the gross domestic product and advertising expenditures were not universal across the nations, however. It appears that nature of the economies, the degree of economic fluctuation, segments of industry affected, national economic policies, and other factors may play roles in the advertising expenditure choices. The study also finds that print media are more affected by recessions than broadcast media.

The results show that, for the most part, individuals' perceptions of their own economic situations have no significant effect on their policy support. Negative perceptions of the national economic outlook reduce support for climate policy in the US, but not in Germany. However, the magnitude of this national economy effect in the US is small. On the other hand, individuals' climate risk perceptions consistently have a statistically significant and large effect across various model specifications, and interestingly, this pattern holds for the US, whose government is among the less ambitious in global climate policy, as well as Germany, which is among the frontrunners. Our study indicates that the state of the economy may not trump climate risk considerations as conventional wisdom claims. © 2015.","","Germany; United States; assessment method; economic analysis; environmental policy; numerical model; risk perception","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84927720571"

This dissatisfaction reflects the growing questioning of the benefits of privatization, the general downturn of global markets in the past few years and the resulting swing of the pendulum back toward increased governmental supervision, the overselling of privatization as a panacea for all economic problems, and the concern that privatization does not produce macroeconomic and distributional gains equivalent to its microeconomic benefits. This article takes stock of the empirical evidence and shows that in competitive sectors privatization has been a resounding success in improving firm performance. In infrastructure sectors, privatization improves welfare, a broader and crucial objective, when it is accompanied by proper policy and regulatory frameworks. The article argues that despite the growing concerns privatization should be neither abandoned nor reversed. Rather, there should be a strengthening of efforts to privatize correctly: by better tailoring privatization to local conditions, deepening efforts to promote competition and regulatory frameworks, enforcing transparency in sales processes, and introducing mechanisms to ensure that the poor have access to affordable essential services. © The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / THE WORLD BANK 2004; all rights reserved.","","economic policy; privatization; public attitude; state role","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-3042823538"

The satisfaction levels of the mainland Chinese travelers on 34 hotel service attributes were studied using the disconfirmation paradigm. A total of 203 mainland Chinese travelers were interviewed. The results indicated that mainland Chinese travelers were satisfied with “Availability of personal care amenities”, “Quietness of the room”, “Availability of food and beverage variety” and dissatisfied with “Recreation facilities” “Availability of frequent travelers’ program” and the “Baggage handling service”. Eight dimensions of hotel services were identified. “Service quality and value” and “Augmented product quality” dimensions were found to be more important than others in influencing their overall satisfaction levels and the likelihood of returning to the same hotels.

This paper argues that researchers need to draw more careful distinctions amongst different types of recessionary hardships and the mechanisms that may underlie their associations with health behaviors. We focus on unemployment experience, measured decline in economic resources, and perceived decline in economic resources, all of which are likely to occur more often during recessions, and explore whether their associations with health behaviors are consistent or different. We use population-based longitudinal data collected by the Michigan Recession and Recovery Study in the wake of the Great Recession in the United States. We evaluate whether those who had experienced each of these three hardships were more likely to adopt new negative health behaviors, specifically cigarette smoking, harmful and hazardous alcohol consumption, or marijuana consumption. We find that, net of controls and the other two recessionary hardships, unemployment experience was associated with increased hazard of starting marijuana use. Measured decline in economic resources was associated with increased hazard of cigarette smoking and lower hazard of starting marijuana use. Perceived decline in economic resources was linked to taking up harmful and hazardous drinking. Our results suggest heterogeneity in the pathways that connect hardship experiences and different health behaviors. They also indicate that relying on only one measure of hardship, as many past studies have done, could lead to an incomplete understanding of the relationship between economic distress and health behaviors. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Alcohol; Economic decline; Health behavior; Marijuana; Recession; Smoking; U.S.A.; Unemployment","Adult; Alcoholism; Economic Recession; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Male; Marijuana Abuse; Michigan; Middle Aged; Perception; Qualitative Research; Risk-Taking; Smoking; Socioeconomic Factors; Unemployment; Young Adult; United States; Cannabis sativa; Alcohol; Economic decline; Health behavior; Marijuana; Recession; Smoking; U.S.A.; Unemployment; alcohol; economic impact; economic instability; public health; smoking; unemployment; adult; alcohol consumption; article; cannabis addiction; controlled study; coping behavior; economic recession; educational status; female; health behavior; human; longitudinal study; male; population research; self report; smoking; unemployment; United States","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84896896997"

Especially, the current surge of individual car use is worrying and the question remains which users might be able and willing to substitute public transport by cycling. This effect is interesting to study for the case of Hanover Region, because of the well-developed biking infrastructure that makes biking a viable alternative to individual car use. In this paper, we analyze survey data from June 2020 on the use of transportation modes before and during the pandemic in the Hanover Region. We ask if and how the over 4.000 participants substitute public transport and what characterizes those who chose biking over individual car use. We use multivariate regression models and find evidence that Stadtbahn (local light rail) and bus are substituted by bike, car and working from home, while train use is not significantly replaced by car and seems to be positively related to bike use. The data also shows that women have a higher level of fear of infection than men have during public transport use and therefore reduce public transport use more. Moreover, income displays a positive effect on increased car use while cycling is independent of socio-economic indicators but instead driven by the eco-consciousness of users. Surprisingly, we find that car use was increased in particular by residents of Hanover city, while it was decreased by residents of less densely populated urban areas in the region. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Covid 19; Public transport; Spatial embeddedness; Substitutability; Transport disruption; Travel behavior","Germany; Hannover; Lower Saxony; Automobiles; Economic analysis; Regression analysis; Car use; Covid 19; Embeddedness; Pollution emissions; Public transport; Spatial embeddedness; Substitutability; Transport disruption; Transport sectors; Travel behaviour; bus transport; car use; COVID-19; cycle transport; public transport; railway transport; regression analysis; spatial analysis; travel behavior; Bicycles","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85115634620"

Resistance is expected because reforms typically produce economic downturns, at least over the short term. Under normal circumstances, we expect citizens to withdraw support from governments during periods of economic decline. If citizens withdraw support, then governments, worried about the next election, may abandon reforms. But our expectations should be different of new democracies pursuing promarket reforms. Citizens may believe governments when they claim that things have to get worse before they get better or that economic stagnation is the fault of the past model. Research in Poland, Peru, and Mexico, reported in this special issue, supports these expectations. Hence under democracy there is more scope for support of painful reforms than frequently acknowledged. © 1996, SAGE Periodicals Press.

The failure rate among this group by mid-year 1991 had risen 37% from the previous year. Thus, recessions pose a serious threat to the survival of entrepreneurial firms. Understanding how the business cycle influences performance and what strategies are effective in such turbulent times has practical value for managers of entrepreneurial firms. In this paper we report a large-scale empirical research study involving subjective and financial information from 118 publicly traded U.S. manufacturing firms. The participating firms are involved in technologically demanding and highly innovative industry segments: Industrial and Computer Equipment; Electrical Equipment and Components; and Measuring, Analysis, and Control Instruments. None of the firms has achieved a market share of more than one half of one percent (< 0.5%). The goal of the study was to determine the components of a marketing strategy that enabled a firm in these industries to withstand the negative financial consequences of a recession. We find that, in these industries, a company's marketing strategies preceding a recession strongly impact the extent of economic downturn on the firm, and influence its odds of a timely and complete recovery. Our specific prescriptions follow: First, maintain marketing activities in the core business as assurance against recession. Increasing sales and advertising, increasing breadth of production, and increasing geographic coverage improve performance during both the peak and the contraction of the business cycle. Second, during the peak period, cautiously expand with an emphasis on marketing efficiency. Increasing the number of channels of distribution and cutting price have a negative effect unless accompanied by sales-force performance measurement. A simple emphasis on incentives and efficiency alone hurts a firm as a recession hits. All of these prescriptions run counter to existing views that suggest that recession simply requires cutbacks and retrenchment. Recessions seem to be different from other threats to firm viability, and marketing activities appear to help pull the firm through a macroeconomic downturn. © 1997 Elsevier Science Inc.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0031184888"

Furthermore, many but not all economic downturns are also accompanied by a dramatic change in the dynamic behavior of short-term interest rates. It is suggested that these nonlinearities are most naturally interpreted as resulting from short-run failures in the employment and credit markets and that understanding these short-run failures is the key to understanding the nature of the business cycle. © 2005, The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.","","","Review","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-33646425618"

However, a synthesis of the research done in developed and emerging markets is missing. This paper attempts such a synthesis by comparing and contrasting the past cumulative empirical research evidence on the relationship between diversification and firm performance in the context of developed economies to the more recent work in the emerging economies. The empirical literature has been divided into three broad perspectives, and the paper highlights the considerable diversity in its findings in developed and emerging markets across each of these perspectives. Based on this study, it is proposed that related diversification is preferable in developed economies and should be based on specific resources, whereas unrelated diversification is appropriate in emerging economies and should be based on generic resources. Although agency problems exist in both contexts, it is argued that the type of problem differs in developed and emerging markets. The paper concludes by identifying three directions for future research. First, the relationship between diversification and performance should be examined across each industry separately and not in aggregate. Secondly, future research needs to examine the organizational mechanisms required to make diversification successful. Finally, the relationship needs to be examined under unstable and dynamic situations such as the current global economic downturn. © 2011 The Authors.

Comedy is currently enjoying unprecedented growth within the British culture industries. Defying the recent economic downturn, it has exploded into a booming billion-pound industry both on TV and on the live circuit. Despite this, academia has either ignored comedy or focused solely on analysing comedians or comic texts. This scholarship tends to assume that through analysing an artist’s intentions or techniques, we can somehow understand what is and what isn’t funny. But this poses a fundamental question - funny to whom? How can we definitively discern how audiences react to comedy? Comedy and Distinction shifts the focus to provide the first ever empirical examination of British comedy taste. Drawing on a large-scale survey and in-depth interviews carried out at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, the book explores what types of comedy people like (and dislike), what their preferences reveal about their sense of humour, how comedy taste lubricates everyday interaction, and how issues of social class, gender, ethnicity and geographical location interact with patterns of comic taste. Friedman asks: • Are some types of comedy valued higher than others in British society? • Does more ‘legitimate’ comedy taste act as a tangible resource in social life - a form of cultural capital? • What role does humour play in policing class boundaries in contemporary Britain? This book will be of interest to students and scholars of sociology, social class, social theory, cultural studies and comedy studies. © 2014 Sam Friedman.","Contemporary social theory; Cultural theory; Popular culture; Social class; Sociology & social policy; Sociology of culture","","Book","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84954593852"

We use three cross-national longitudinal surveys to address this issue: two collected in Costa Rica in the midst of a severe economic crisis in the late 1970s and early 1980s; and one in West Germany during the recession of the mid-1970s. We show that in both countries, overall support for the political regime remained extremely high during the economic decline, while satisfaction with incumbent performance fluctuated much more sharply. Moreover, at the individual level, changes in satisfaction with incumbent performance were only weakly related to changes in regime support. These results provide strong evidence suggesting that if democracies enter economic downturns with initially high levels of regime support, they will be able to withstand even severe, prolonged crises of economic performance. © 1989, Cambridge University Press.

Our study used data from 256 U.S. consumers to test hypothesized relationships between frugality measured as a personality- or lifestyle-type construct characteristic embedded in the social psychology of consumption. We identified four key constructs as likely antecedents of frugality: materialism, status consumption, brand engagement, and consumer independence.

The study draws on data collected for the Longitudinal Study of Young People in England (LSYPE), a cohort of young people born in 1989/90 completing compulsory education in 2006 - just before the onset of the Great Recession. Data on parental worklessness collected between 2004 and 2006 was linked to information about subsequent employment activities of their offspring, in particular the experience of not being in education, employment or training (NEET) between 2007 and 2010 (ages 16 to 20 years). Parental worklessness was significantly associated with their sons' and daughters' experience of being NEET for longer periods of time (months spent in NEET). However, much of this association was explained by a number of other socio-economic risks facing these young people and their families (e.g. low parental education level, living in rented accommodation and in highly deprived neighbourhoods). Furthermore, the role of individual agency, in particular educational achievement orientation (EAO) as a potential mediator was examined. Although parental worklessness was associated with lower levels of EAO, especially among young males, the findings also suggest that EAO can serve as a potential resource for young men and women in adverse economic circumstances. The study does not support the assumption of an inter-generational transmission of a 'culture of worklessness' but points to the role of multiple deprivations and lack of local opportunities in shaping the life chances of young people.","Achievement orientation; Gender; Inter-generational; Socio-economic resources; Worklessness","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84901666249"

To date, however, there has been limited exploration into whether long-run evolutionary growth paths or trajectories influence regional economic resilience and what types of trajectories might be more associated with resilience. This article explores the connections between regional economic resilience and regional and national growth trajectories by utilizing a novel set of methods to group regions according to the similarity of their growth paths, identifying the relative importance of national growth for regional growth, and categorizing regions according to their resilience to the 2007–2008 economic crisis. The results suggest that regions have empirically identifiable long-run and path-dependent development trajectories that are significantly associated with industrial employment shares and observed resilience outcomes. Critically, however, these regional growth paths are significantly shaped by national trajectories. Furthermore, regions with greater employment shares in sectors that are less susceptible to demand fluctuations are likely to experience more stable growth rates and be more resilient to economic downturns. This has implications for understanding the importance of evolutionary trends and specifically the role of national contexts and industrial legacies in shaping regional resilience. © 2018, © 2018 Clark University.","evolutionary economic geography; GVA; R11; R23; R58; resilience; trajectories","Europe; economic geography; empirical analysis; employment; financial crisis; growth rate; regional economy; trend analysis","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85042216728"

This article aims to examine the challenges of supply chain management and to propose a triple-C (cease-control-combine) remedy for the North American auto industry's supply chain management. The authors applied management theories, collected information from managers at different levels of the auto industry's supply chain management, and developed a novel theoretical model of sustainability in supply chain management for the auto industry. It is argued that outsourcing to low cost countries – the current supply chain strategy – is not only unsustainable but also irresponsible for the auto industry and society. A triple-C (cease-control-combine) remedy is proposed for the auto industry's supply chain management. The proposed triple-C strategy will save the auto industry money in R&D investment, reduce quality cost and inventory waste, help the industry go through the volatile economy, and achieve sustainable development. With close relationships and strong supports from suppliers, the industry can speed up technology development, introduce new gas efficiency models quickly, and become less dependent on gas price. Finally, the triple-C strategy will help the industry keep jobs and generate new jobs in the USA. These activities lead to public support and restored corporate image.

Specifically, the municipalities showing higher innovation and entrepreneurial environment (i.e. major cities) are preferred locations.

The impact of the recent economic crisis in Italy is controversial in the current demographic literature. OBJECTIVE We wish to evaluate whether the recent changes in male and female unemployment are differently linked to fertility in different geographic areas of Italy. METHODS We used the following official aggregate data for the period 1995-2012: unemployment quarterly rates from the Labour Force Surveys conducted by the National Institute of Statistics (Istat) and quarterly general fertility rates. We applied a monitoring approach for the identification of structural breaks inside both of the time series and used a dynamic regression to identify specific temporal links between unemployment and fertility. RESULTS Both male and female unemployment rates are negatively associated with fertility in the northern and central regions of Italy. Unemployment rates seem to be good predictors of fertility in these regions, although male unemployment appears to further reduce fertility beyond the reduction predicted by female unemployment. CONCLUSIONS In northern and central Italy, the recent rise in unemployment is negatively correlated with the fertility rate. The recent economic downturn seems to be linked in a more ambiguous and weak way to the fertility rate in the southern area. © 2016 Alberto Cazzola, Lucia Pasquini & Aurora Angeli.","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85006856352"

In particular, the paper tackles two important topics. The first concerns the justification for EU regional policies in a period of economic downturn, since they may seem less urgent and appropriate than short term demand policies. Instead, as the paper argues, the crisis exerts considerable pressure on several EU countries, and may even, in the worst case, jeopardize two decades of efforts towards EU enlargement and cohesion. In this circumstance, regional policies are required to rebalance the spatial effects that the ongoing crisis is determining on interregional convergence trends, in strict relationship with some new monetary and fiscal policy tools agreed at the EU level lifting the pressure that present austerity measures are exerting on many, mainly Southern, European countries. The second topic relates to the most appropriate design that cohesion policies should follow, building in a critical way on the results of the robust policy debate of the last decade. The message that the paper conveys from a conceptual point of view is that the winning strategy is neither to focus on champion places and regions, in search of the highest efficiency, nor on lagging areas only, in search of equity, but on the development potential of all places, represented by its territorial capital - material, human, cognitive, social and relational. Policies should be tailored on each region's specificities, competitive advantage and needs, engaging all possible assets and enlarging existing excellences. This pathway simultaneously avoids the social and economic costs of a concentrated development and is able to guarantee the highest returns in terms of both competitiveness and cohesion. The paper concludes by proposing suggestions on how to respond to the specific and particular challenges that the New Member countries of the EU are now facing, on the basis of the previous conceptual and empirical evidence. © 2015 Regional Science Association International.","Economic crisis; EU cohesion policies; Regional growth and disparities","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84940849812"

Emerging out of popular unrest over the economic downturn of 2008 and the perceived radical agenda of President Barack Obama, the Tea Party quickly captured the imagination of disenchanted conservatives. Media coverage of the movement was abundant, with a frame contest between the TPM and its political opponents swiftly surfacing. Media frames bracketed discussions over the authenticity of the Tea Party, the composition of its members, the movement's message, and whether the TPM was poised for a long-term impact. This study systematically analyzes the predominant media frames that materialized in 882 news packets from nine major print and television news sources between 19 February 2009 and 30 November 2010 in order to better understand the role the US media played in defining the Tea Party, and to determine whether Tea Party perceptions of its media coverage were accurate. Four sets of diametric frames appeared in the media-the Everyday American vs. Non-Mainstream, Grassroots vs. Establishment-Affiliated, Fiscal-Federal Frustrations vs. Amalgam of Grievances, and Election Impact vs. Flash in the Pan.

They have also coincided with the highest rates of growth of the global economy on record. The downturn of house prices in the US that began in late 2006 has been the trigger for the US sub-prime crisis, itself the catalyst for the broad financial crisis that began in August 2007 which by September 2008 had become the worst US financial crisis since 1929. As a result, the structure of the highly influential US mortgage finance system has already changed fundamentally. These US problems will lead to a thorough review of mortgage securitization processes and of the wholesale funding of mortgage finance across the world. However, housing markets and housing finance systems differ significantly between countries and will channel the shocks originating from the US with varying intensity. Given the interdependence of the global economy, the quality of the US policy response and its impact on the depth and duration of the US recession will influence house price downturns in all other countries. This paper, written in the midst of the US crisis, looks to our understanding of fundamental economic and financial relationships: first, to describe the key features of the house price boom; second, to examine the likely impacts of the unwinding of that boom; and, finally, to bring out implications for affordability, the provision of housing credit and the most appropriate forms of tenure for higher risk households.","Affordability; Global credit boom; Housing price; Volatility","North America; United States; commodity price; financial crisis; global economy; housing market; mortgage lending","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-58849150260"

Design/methodology/approach: The paper uses secondary data obtained from DataStream covering 63 financial institutions over a period of 12 years. A number of additional statistical estimations, including random effects and fixed effects, are conducted to test the robustness of the findings. Findings: The outcome of this empirical research shows that the presence of females on the corporate boards of UK financial institutions has a positive and statistically significant relationship with firm value. The authors’ evidence reveals a positive and statistically significant impact on the firm’s value prior to the financial crisis, that is, during the pre-crisis period (2000-2006), meaning that women contributed significantly to the firm’s value. However, after the financial crisis, the presence of females on the board had no significant effect on the firm’s value. A reasonable explanation may be that, whilst the financial crisis was over in the period 2009-2011, the entire UK economy was still experiencing an economic downturn, and financial firms were no exception, irrespective of whether there was female representation on any corporate board. Overall, the findings are consistent with the prior studies. Practical implications: The results have practical implications for governments, policy-makers and regulatory authorities, by indicating the importance of women to corporate success. Originality/value: Despite several research projects on board gender diversity (BGD), this research is unique compared to the previous empirical studies, primarily because it is the first-time research of this nature is empirically ascertaining BGD and firm value in UK financial institutions, also during the pre-/post-financial crisis era. This paper contributes to the corporate governance literature by offering new insights on board diversity and firms’ value relationship.

To control high driver turnover, trucking firms have attempted to implement various driver recruitment and retention strategies, including pay raises, bonuses, equipment upgrades, and flexible schedules. Based on exploratory findings of selected U.S. firms, this article has studied the impact of these strategies on turnover.

I show that this discretion of whether to honor borrowing requests under commitments generates reputational concerns on the part of banks and can lead to an equilibrium in which loan commitments serve their role in increasing credit supply relative to the spot credit market, but produce the inefficiency of excessive credit supply when the real interest rate is low and the economy is doing well.

Prior research shows that bootstrap financing is an important enabler for the growth of resource-constrained early-stage ventures. However, little is known about the use of bootstrap financing in crises, during which the preservation of liquidity is particularly salient. We investigate the determinants of bootstrap financing in the 2020 COVID-19 crisis using a sample of 17,046 German entrepreneurial ventures. We formulate hypotheses about the determinants of bootstrap financing from a necessity, human capital, and opportunity cost perspective. Among others, our results show that the severity of the crisis for the venture, the level of private consumption, and self-employment experience are positively associated with an increased use of bootstrap financing measures. Our study contributes to the literature on bootstrap financing and illuminates how entrepreneurial ventures maintain liquidity in crises. Plain English Summary Economic downturns or crises often lead to financial distress for ventures. To survive such tumultuous times, ventures need to preserve their liquidity. Bootstrap financing refers to measures that entrepreneurial ventures take to preserve liquidity (like sending payment reminders, paying invoices later, reducing tax advances, reducing commercial rent). Because little is known about how bootstrap financing is used during crises, we investigate how it was used during the COVID-19 crisis. Our study builds on a survey of 17,046 German entrepreneurial ventures and self-employed individuals. We find that the use of bootstrap financing is positively related to how severe the crisis was for the venture along with the level of private consumption and self-employment experience of the venture’s owner. In contrast, a negative association exists with private liquidity, business liquidity, how long before the owner retires, and part-time self-employment. The positive association between self-employment experience and bootstrap financing indicates that targeted entrepreneurship education programs or webinars should focus on inexperienced entrepreneurs so that these individuals are prepared to use bootstrapping methods to maintain liquidity during crises. © 2021, The Author(s).","Bootstrap finance; Coronavirus; COVID-19; Crises; Entrepreneurship","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85099741141"

The purpose of this paper is to propose a Fit Manufacturing Framework (FMF), the adoption of which can help manufacturing companies to become economically sustainable and operate effectively in a global competitive market. This contribution extends the previous work by the authors and provides an evolution on the initial work through enhancing the development of Fit manufacture through developing a more robust framework and a more comprehensive functional testing of the framework. Design/methodology/approach - The proposed FMF provides a new manufacturing management perspective and a new manufacturing management strategy for creating economically sustainable manufacturing organisations. It builds upon the principles of existing manufacturing paradigms, along with innovative management concepts, to set up the conditions necessary for sustainability. A pilot application of the framework in three SMEs shows positive initial results when assessed against four Measures of Performance. Findings - Manufacturing strategies such as Lean and Agility allow companies to deliver bottom-line savings in production terms, although their effectiveness depends upon the volume and demand profile of their products. The trend towards mass customisation requires companies to provide personalised products and services at mass production prices. This now places a further burden on companies and therefore a holistic manufacturing framework must be developed in order to ensure that the factory of the future is able to meet this new demand. This paper proposes a Fit manufacturing paradigm which integrates the manufacturing efficiencies achieved through Lean and Agility with the need to break into new markets through effective marketing and product innovation strategies to achieve long term economic sustainability. The small-scale application of the approach in a case company shows the initial results to be positive when measured against key MOPs developed within this paper. Originality/value - The development of a Fit paradigm aimed at tackling directly the issues of economic sustainability is proposed and is considered by the authors as one of a kind. Fit will also provide a framework for the implementation of sustainable manufacturing operations within organisations. Copyright © 2012 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

This is in line with the occupational status maturation hypothesis. Both class origin and educational attainment affect occupational attainment. The effects of educational attainment vary more over the career, but depend on the educational attainment level in question. Successive cohorts of women gain higher occupational prestige, and continue to gain in occupational prestige longer across their careers. We also find that cohorts that entered the labour market in times of economic downturns and restructuring (the oil crisis years and the early 1990s) had more difficulties in establishing their careers. Returns to education generally increase across cohorts, while class background differences decrease, as has been reported in earlier research. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","Careers; Growth curve analysis; Occupational attainment; Stratification; Sweden","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-79960589977"

These effects include supplementation and substitution. This article examines both effects by studying two instruments of state budget stabilization policy: general fund balances and budget stabilization funds. States normally maintain budget surpluses in the general fund. In recent decades, many also created separate budget stabilization funds to guard against economic downturns. Empirical results show that substitution occurs between these instruments. In other words, the influence of the first instrument is partially offset by the second. The second instrument also produces some independent impacts-called supplementation-that increase the overall influence of both instruments. Such self-reinforcement decreases over time, suggesting that multiple policy instruments are most effective in the initial stage of application.

We analyse an overlapping generations model with two pollutants: The flow pollutant causes immediate damages, but the stock pollutant harms the environment only in the future. Hence, a succession of myopic governments lets stock pollution grow with income. In contrast, the flow pollutant follows an EKC whose downturn might be caused by the neglect of future damages and by ever rising stock pollution: Without the stock pollutant the PIR for the flow pollutant can increase monotonically. We also show that the turning point of the EKC for the flow pollutant lies at lower levels of income and of flow pollution if stock pollution is high and harmful. This casts doubts on most empirical EKC studies because they assume that the turning point occurs at the same income level in all countries. However, it is consistent with recent empirical findings that the income level at the turning point of the EKC varies across countries.","abatement; economic growth; environmental Kuznets curve; flow and stock pollution; myopia","Curve fitting; Environmental protection; Mathematical models; Pollution; Environmental Kuznets curve (EKC); Pollution-income relationship (PIR); economic growth; environmental economics; income; Kuznets curve; pollution control; Economics","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-11144270225"

Nonetheless, during times of economic downturn, some industries take the biggest hit, whereas at times of economic boom they reap most benefits. To provide insight into this phenomenon, we map supply networks of industries and firms and investigate how the supply network structure mediates the effect of economy on industry or firm sales. Previous research has shown that retail sales are correlated with the state of the economy. Since retailers source their products from other industries, the sales of their suppliers can also be correlated with the state of the economy. This correlation represents the source of systematic risk for an industry that propagates through a supply chain network. Specifically, we identify the following mechanisms that can affect the correlation between sales and the state of the economy in a supply chain network: propagation of systematic risk into production decisions, aggregation of orders from multiple customers in a supply chain network, and aggregation of orders over time. We find that the first effect does not amplify the correlation; however, the latter two intensify correlation and result in the amplification of correlation upstream in supply networks. We demonstrate three managerial implications of this phenomenon: implications for the cost of capital, for the risk-adjusted valuation of supply chain improvement projects, and for supplier selection and risk. © 2016 INFORMS.","Empirical study; Risk management; Supply chain network","Risk management; Sales; Supply chains; Economic downturn; Empirical studies; Industrial production; Managerial implications; Production decisions; Supplier selection; Supply chain network; Supply networks; Industrial economics","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84975136227"

For low-income migrants in the region, the monetary crisis has not only reorganized the labor market, but it has also brought about an intensification of the stigma placed on young women's independent residence in an export processing zone. Household surveys and in-depth interviews with migrants and members of their origin and destination site neighborhoods, both before and during the economic retrenchment, illustrate that ideas about women's sexual morality are a key part of the context within which migration decisions are gendered. The article situates survey and interview findings within an overview of Indonesia's recent development history, economic crisis, and official state gender ideology. The article argues that migrants and their communities have identified the 'prostitute' as a female-gendered metaphor for the crisis, and finds that post-1997 narratives of women's mobility increasingly revolve around normative judgements regarding young women's independent mobility and sexual behavior.","","Indonesia; Sulawesi; financial crisis; labor market; migration determinant; mobility; womens status","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0034085634"

Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses simple descriptive analysis to examine the COVID-19 situation in Nigeria. Findings: The findings reveal that the economic downturn in Nigeria was triggered by a combination of declining oil price and spillovers from the COVID-19 outbreak, which not only led to a fall in the demand for oil products but also stopped economic activities from taking place when social distancing policies were enforced. The government responded to the crisis by providing financial assistance to businesses and a small number of households that were affected by the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak. The monetary authority adopted accommodative monetary policies and offered a targeted 3.5 trillion loan support to some sectors. These efforts should have prevented the economic crisis from occurring but it did not. Economic agents could not freely engage in economic activities for fear of contracting the COVID-19 disease that was spreading very fast at the time. Practical implications: The implication of the study is that policymakers should pay attention to three areas of the economy for economic and structural reform. One, policymakers should introduce economic reforms to diversify the economy and reduce Nigeria's dependence on revenue from crude oil export. Two, policymakers in Nigeria should invest in healthcare infrastructure to improve the ability of the national health system to withstand the outbreak of contagious diseases. Three, there is also a need to build appropriate digital infrastructure to facilitate the transition from “face-to-face” business activities to a “digital or online” business activities, which can help to grow the digital economy. Also, policymakers should use legislation to create a robust social welfare safety net for all citizens particularly for unemployed citizens and poor households.

This has serious implications for the nature of democratic accountability, since those who are less likely to vote in an economic downturn may also be the ones most likely to punish the incumbent party. In fact, some have used aggregated electoral data to justify such a claim (Radcliff 1994). However, such conclusions are premature. Once the intervening effects of blame attribution are taken into consideration, there are conditions under which economic adversity actually enhances turnout. Data from the American National Election Studies (1990-98) demonstrate that those facing economic adversity are more likely to vote when they blame the government for economic outcomes. These are the same people who have been shown in numerous economic voting studies to be much less supportive of the in-party. These findings suggest that economic adversity does not necessarily constrain democratic accountability and highlight the perils associated with making inferences about individual-level behavior with aggregate data.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0037990105"

International financial institutions, together with Thailand's Democrat-led government, emphasised further market reforms, liberalisation, deregulation, decentralisation, privatisation and a reduced role for the state. The deep economic downturn saw a popular rejection of such policies, meaning that the neo-liberal interregnum was short-lived. The 2001 landslide electoral victory of the Thai Rak Thai Party symbolised the intensity of opposition to neo-liberalism. It also showed that national governments remain critical in shaping markets and that domestic economic actors continue to have significant political roles. In Thailand, far from neutering domestic capital's political capacity, the crisis and opposition to neoliberalism saw this enhanced. One reason for this was that neoliberal restructuring was not simply about the efficient operation of the market. Rather, it demanded a fundamental transformation of the operations of government and of the ways that business was organised and conducted. This threatened domestic capital. Its economic survival required that it seize the state so that it could control economic policy-making. This was achieved through the Thai Rak Thai electoral victory and its subsequent rule, where the protection of domestic capital's interests was achieved through a renegotiation of its social contract with other classes. © 2005 Taylor & Francis Ltd.","","development strategy; economic reform; financial crisis; neoliberalism","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-12144260644"

This study aims to examine how and to what extent RM can be implemented in the hotel industry during low-demand periods, particularly during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) crisis. Design/methodology/approach: This paper used semi-structured interviews to gather information from hotel RM executives, RM consultants and RM system providers. Participants were asked to think about the impact of COVID-19 on their RM practices. This paper interviewed 26 revenue executives between January and March 2020. Findings: Core RM processes are still relevant during the COVID-19 crisis; however, not all components are equally important. Business analysis, pricing strategy and demand modeling and forecasting are the most critical RM processes. Inventory and price optimization and setting booking controls are not as important at this time; along with distribution channel management, these processes will become more relevant as demand picks up. Research limitations/implications: Future research in this area should focus on each core RM process separately and in-depth to understand how implementation changes during the crisis and recovery periods. Future studies should also investigate how these processes operate during the recovery period. The full breadth of consequences of the COVID-19 crisis in hotel RM will likely manifest gradually. Therefore, the core RM processes should also be examined when the crisis is over.

Zimbabwe is among the countries more severely affected, where drought impacts have led to water shortages, declining yields, and periods of food insecurity, accompanied by economic downturns. In particular, the country's agricultural sector, mostly comprised of smallholder rainfed systems, is at great risk of drought. In this study, a multimethod approach is applied, including a remote sensing-based analysis of vegetation health data from 1989-2019 to assess the drought hazard, as well as a spatial analysis combined with expert consultations to determine drought vulnerability and exposure of agricultural systems. The results show that droughts frequently occur with changing patterns across Zimbabwe. Every district has been affected by drought during the past thirty years, with varying levels of severity and frequency. Severe drought episodes have been observed in 1991-1992, 1994-1995, 2002-2003, 2015-2016, and 2018-2019. Drought vulnerability and exposure vary substantially in the country, with the south-western provinces of Matabeleland North and South showing particularly high levels.

In this manner, we add to research considering earnings target as an objective of earnings manipulation. Furthermore, our results suggest that these objectives likely change as crisis becomes worse.

However, the long-term effects of openness have yet to be demonstrated, even if few researchers hypothesized that high openness could increase firms' dynamic capabilities and hence their resilience in the face of adversities, such economic downturns. Hence, this article attempts to investigate this dynamic relationship between openness and firm performance with particular considerations addressing the recent financial crisis in 2008. Based upon the UK Community Innovation Survey (CIS) panel data collected between 2006 and 2012, this study finds evidence that supports the positive influence of openness on long-term firm performance. The results show that (i) increasing a firm's openness is an effective way of enhancing its dynamic capability and hence its resilience, and (ii) of all the various configurations of openness, the collaboration with partners outside the firm's value chain and international partners has the highest impact on turnover recovery, as they will increase the chances of acquiring newer knowledge, which in turn will help firms to identify new opportunities to achieve sustainable growth.

The sample comprised 549 employees, managers and HRM staff across a wide range of types of organisations in Australia, New Zealand, the USA, the UK and Canada. While the results supported the contention that HRM effectiveness can be achieved via both “soft” and “hard” approaches, several barriers to HRM take-up were identified and there was little evidence that organisations generally operated HRM policies and practices that were seen as effective. Although very few differences between countries were found, the authors suggest the barriers identified and related ineffectiveness of HRM may be all the more detrimental to the competitiveness of Australian and New Zealand organisations in light of the recent economic downturn in the Asia-Pacific region. © 1999, MCB UP Limited","Australia; Barriers; Competitive advantage; Human resource management; NewZealand","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0033483832"

This article explores whether a capabilities approach, as originally developed in the work of Amartya Sen and Martha Nussbaum, offers a potential framework for new thinking. It is argued that the capabilities approach is best thought of not as offering a detailed road map for policy, but as providing a critically different conceptualization of the purpose and principles of public policy. In seeking an alternative to neo-liberal hegemony a capabilities approach therefore can provide a framework for new thinking, and an underpinning ideological narrative from which policy development can flow. © The Author(s) 2011.","Amartya Sen; capabilities approach; employment; welfare; work","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-79959354831"

The purpose of this study is to develop a more accurate and stable business failure prediction model by using a majority voting ensemble method with a decision tree (DT) with experimental data on US restaurant between 1980 and 2017. According to the diversity principle and individual optimized principle, DT and logit were selected as basic learning algorithms for the voting ensemble of business failure prediction. Three models, including an entire period (EP) model, an economic downturn (ED) model, and an economic expansion (EE) model, were developed by using WEKA 3.9. The prediction accuracy of the models were 88.02% for the EP model, 80.81% for the ED model, and 87.02 % for the EE model. While the EE model revealed the market capitalization, operating cash flow after interest and dividends (OCFAID), cash conversion cycle (CCC), return on capital employed (ROCE), accumulated retained earnings, stock price, and Tobin's Q as significant variables, the ED model exposed quite different variables such as OCFAID, KZ index, stock price, and CCC. The EP model combined most of the variables from two sub-divided models except for Tobin's Q, stock price, and debt to equity (D/E) ratio. The contribution of the paper is twofold. First, this is the first study to comprehensively evaluate the financial and market-driven variables in the context of predicting restaurant failure, especially during economic recessions. This research has employed several accounting-based measures, market-based variables, and a macro-economic factor to improve the relevance and effectiveness of prediction models. And second, by using an ensemble model with a DT, it has improved both the interpretability of the results and the prediction accuracy. © 2021 Journal of Innovation & Knowledge","Bankruptcy; Business failure prediction; Decision tree (DT); Economic downturns; Ensemble; Financial distress; Macro-Economic factor; Majority voting; Prediction accuracy; Restaurant failure prediction","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85100449727"

Information was gathered through a literature review and interviews of relevant experts, as well as a brainstorming session. It was found that international service trade has greatly affected the Thai health care system and its HRH. From 1965 to 1975 there was massive emigration of physicians from Thailand in response to increasing demand in the United States of America. The country lost about 1,500 physicians, 20% of its total number, during that period. External migration of health professionals occurred without relation to agreements on trade in services. It was also found that free trade in service sectors other than health could seriously affect the health care system and HRH. Free trade in financial services with free flow of low-interest foreign loans, which started in 1993 in Thailand, resulted in the mushrooming of urban private hospitals between 1994 and 1997. This was followed by intensive internal migration of health professionals from rural public to urban private hospitals. After the economic crisis in 1997, with the resulting downturn of the private health sector, reverse brain drain was evident. At the same time, foreign investors started to invest in the bankrupt private hospitals. Since 2001, the return of economic growth and the influx of foreign patients have started another round of internal brain drain. © 2004 Wilbulpolprasert et al, licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-4243082178"

Yet, these explanations can not account for the downturn in birth rates in the 1970s, the delay in childbearing, and the constancy of cohort birth rates which characterize recent Swedish fertility behavior. To summarize the effect of Sweden's economic and policy environment on the observed fertility patterns, I use a neoclassical economic framework to develop the shadow price of fertility. Although strong simplifying assumptions are imposed, the estimated price series exhibit a negative relationship with period fertility rates and the change in the estimated relative prices of fertility over the life cycle lend modest support for the delayed childbearing. © 1995 Springer-Verlag.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0000395264"

It first explores the implications of the global economic downturn of 2008-9 for environmental policies, focusing in particular on the example of action against climate change. The arguments for and against activist fiscal policies in general are then reviewed, and the case made that a demand-induced downturn provides a very good opportunity to undertake a necessary step change in the public spending component of environmental policies and to start working through a backlog of public investment to improve the environment. Fiscal policy should be used to improve the allocation of resources across time and space. Recent fiscal stimuli are considered in the light of this discussion. It is also argued that there is little cause to delay the introduction of price signals to internalize environmental externalities. But the levels at which such signals should be set requires careful analysis; changes over the business cycle may be warranted, depending on the nature of the environmental externality and the cause(s) of the business cycle in question. © The Authors 2010.

It is, however, unclear to what extent only 'marginal' sites were affected, due to the lack of any systematic attempt to view the evidence for settlement and land-use change across a range of landscape types with differing sensitivities to environmental change. This paper addresses this issue by an evaluation of 75 pollen sequences spanning the late Bronze Age and early Iron Age in Britain to assess whether climatic deterioration was sufficient to cause widespread land abandonment. The results provide no evidence for wholesale land-use change at this time; the overall picture is one of continuity of land use or even increased agricultural activity. There are, however, hints of regional variability, with a greater tendency to abandonment of upland areas in Wales, and signs of woodland regeneration in agriculturally productive areas of lowland central southern England. The latter pattern may reflect a combination of rising ground-water levels affecting local land-use in the immediate vicinity of the mires which provide the source of the pollen data, against a backdrop of regional-scale social and economic changes at the Bronze Age-Iron Age transition. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

If so, in what ways?"" Using data on mission statements of 128 large Japanese firms, the paper aims to show that corporate mission has a significant impact on corporate policies that determine employment, board, and financial structures. Design/methodology/approach: The paper provides evidence that strong-mission firms are more likely to retain incumbent employees, promote managers from within firms, and have less debt and a higher percentage of interlocking shareholdings than weak-mission firms. Findings: The evidence supports the view that strong-mission firms value their organizational capital and thus tend to adopt policies to preserve it. It also confirms that corporate mission and its embedded policies contribute to better corporate performance. The paper suggests that the effect of explicit corporate mission and its implementation has practical impacts in corporate policies and business outcomes. Research limitations/implications: The sample is based on firms from Japan. The criteria used to discriminate between strong mission and weak mission firms need further refinement with more rigorous sub-dimensions. In the Japanese context the percentage of inside directors is an important indication of internally promoted managers - one might argue that a measure of external pressures (e.g. law, codes, investors, etc.) might be a better one. The small number of cases and the richness of statements need a richer qualitative analysis in the future. Practical implications: The empirical results provide helpful insight on the organizational behavior of Japanese firms during the long economic downturn from the 1990s to 2000s in Japan and an insight on what to do in view of the challenges facing Japanese firms. Originality/value: The paper presents a model that clarifies the role of mission statement. The extensive literature review includes a diverse set of papers on the role of mission statement. The empirical results suggest how strong Japanese corporate mission, expressed in mission statements, might have impact on corporate outcomes through the formation and utilization of Monozukuri. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Japan; Mission statements","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-77955075470"

Previous research has shown that employment insecurity impedes the entry into homeownership. It is, however, less clear how this delayed entry into homeownership is filtered by contextual arrangements at the country level. Using longitudinal data from the EU Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (2007–11), we confirm prior findings on the negative effect of employment insecurity across European countries. We also find contextual variations. In more marketised housing provision systems in Northern and Western Europe, where mortgages are readily available to those in secure employment, the negative effect of employment insecurity (relative to having secure employment) on the transition into homeownership is accentuated. In more familialistic systems with strongly regulated labour markets in Southern Europe, the difference between young people in different employment situations is smaller, yet still significant. We find similarsized differences between those in insecure and secure employment in the Baltic States, but not in the other Eastern and Central European countries, where housing shortages impede the entry into homeownership for young people across different employment positions. © 2015 Pion and its Licensors.","Cross-national comparison; Employment insecurity; Homeownership; Young people","Baltic States; comparative study; employment; financial crisis; global economy; homeowner; labor market; young population","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84925393683"

For the sector to reduce its emissions in line with climate change objectives, a wholesale transition is required from the current carbon intensive shipping system to one with a lower climatic impact. Drawing on the multi-level perspective from the socio-technical transitions literature, this paper focuses on two technological developments which could reduce the emissions from shipping – slow steaming and wind propulsion. Outlining the landscape changes which may hinder or support the incorporation of each of these innovations into the broader shipping regime the paper shows how slow steaming has been accommodated within this regime, in response to high oil prices and the economic downturn.

The author considers a multiyear perspective on budgeting as a potential solution, with countercyclical fiscal reserves to help ensure stability during fluctuating economic conditions. By adopting budget stabilization funds and keeping sufficient reserves, states can better maintain trend-level public services during recessions. Panel data analysis provides empirical evidence that such funds helped stabilize state general expenditures during downturns. The adoption of countercyclical fiscal policy and budget stabilization funds is a step toward a longer-term perspective on budgeting, thus promoting fiscal stability over the economic cycle.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-33748495979"

The negative psychological effect of unemployment has increasingly garnered attention. Previous literature has offered a formidable prognosis, stating that in response to job-loss, people typically follow a pattern of rapid decline in life satisfaction and never return to preunemployment levels. In this paper, we attempt to search for individual differences in response to job-loss using Latent Growth Mixture Modeling (LGMM) framework. By building homogeneous trajectories within a prospective design from 3 years before to 4 years after job-loss, we find that the majority of individuals (82%) demonstrate no long-term effects on life satisfaction in response to unemployment. We also examine the roll of larger market forces on levels of life satisfaction during and around the event of job-loss. Using a correlation model, demonstrated that life satisfaction is positively influenced by the regional unemployment rate. Clark (2003) argues that people report higher well-being when they lose their job if those in proximity to them are also becoming unemployed. Using the national and local unemployment rate in a regression model nested in the Latent Growth Model, we found that a social comparison effect is present immediately before unemployment but not once individuals became unemployed. This implies that people reference national and local employment trends in an attempt to anticipate their own course of employment rather than referencing those trends after job-loss. © 2010 American Psychological Association.","Latent Growth Mixture Modeling; Life satisfaction; Unemployment","adult; article; attitude to change; controlled study; correlational study; employment status; exploratory behavior; female; human; human experiment; job change; job market; job stress; Latent Growth Mixture Modeling; life satisfaction; male; methodology; psychological model; social behavior; unemployment","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-78549257760"

In addition, we test how two major crises (the financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic) affect the sustainability-financial performance relationship. Firms with better sustainability performance are hit harder on their financial performance, but the benefits of financial performance on sustainability are strengthened during the financial crisis. During the ongoing COVID-19 crisis, firms with strong sustainability performance have been more resilient, and their financial performance has dropped less than firms with poor sustainability performance. However, the benefits of profitability on sustainability are weakened.

The results indicate that while most states have not witnessed a reduction in expenditure volatility over the business cycle, states with rule-bound stabilization funds experience significantly less expenditure volatility from utilizing a budget stabilization fund.

This paper addresses the issue of how the likelihood of individuals to engage in the creation of new firms is affected by a recessionary climate. Furthermore, the study focuses on how the recession-driven shake-out effect varies across local contexts (i.e., sub-national regions). The case of Spain in the critical period of 2007–2010 is examined by using multilevel logistic mediation models on individual-level and sub-national region-level panel data. The results show that entrepreneurship shrinks during economic downturns, suggesting a pro-cyclical trend.

However, no attempt at understanding Belarus can succeed without examining its economic dynamics and political discourse. The analysis that follows will evaluate Belarus' accomplishments under the Soviet regime. The point is made that the socio-economic situation in Belarus does not quite fit the abysmal picture painted by the international media. It is shown that, alongside the vague and ambivalent identity of ethnic Belarusians, the current economic paradigm embraced by the Belarus political regime is rooted in some Soviet-born constraints and in the desire to avert a major downturn in the living standard of Belarusians. The Belarusian political scene is identified as bi-polar with the centrist part being least structured and organised. Because of this the democratisation of Belarus has not succeeded so far. A part of the blame for this outcome lies with the West, which seems to misread the major conflict of interests in Belarus. Finally, attempts to pigeonhole the current socio-political situation in Belarus and the personality of its leader are analysed.","","Belarus; Eastern Europe; Eurasia; Europe; ethnicity; national politics; political ideology; socioeconomic conditions","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0842349459"

Design/methodology/approach – This paper compares the market timing and stock selection abilities of 159 mutual funds listed on the Saudi Arabian stock market from 2007 to 2011 by using the CAPM regression and Treynor and Mazuy models. The paper addresses the benchmark problem from which most prior IMFs studies suffered by using appropriate regional benchmarks. As a robustness check, coefficients of IMFs and conventional funds are compared by using the differences in mean and standard deviation analysis obtained from the standard CAPM model on individual funds. Findings – The empirical results show evidence of better performance of IMFs relative to conventional funds during periods of economic crisis. In addition, although there is no evidence of relative superiority in market timing ability, managers of IMFs appear to have better stock selection ability during times of economic crisis. Research limitations/implications – The combination of superior stock selection ability of IMFs and the negative market timing ability of conventional funds suggest that IMFs offer better hedging opportunities for investors during periods of economic downturn. Practical implications – The findings of this paper suggest that IMFs can provide hedging benefits during adverse economic conditions – an issue of great importance due to the current and forecast insecurity surrounding the global capital markets. By holding a portion of their investment portfolio in IMFs, investors can experience a higher degree of confidence in terms of investment security, growth and returns. Similarly, managers of conventional funds can improve risk adjusted performance by following similar screening criteria as IMFs during economic slowdowns. Originality/value – This paper represents the first comprehensive study on the comparative performance of Islamic and conventional mutual funds during the current financial crisis by including all fund managers listed on the Saudi Arabian stock market. The paper extends the knowledge of the emerging literature of Islamic finance and mutual fund performance. © 2013, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Capital markets; Islamic mutual funds; Market timing ability; Performance evaluation; Saudi Arabia; Stock selection ability","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84901842742"

Findings based on a sample of 275 large publicly listed U.S. firms reveal that family firms outperform non-family firms during recessions. This superior performance is partially driven by family firms' proactive marketing behavior and their relatively strong emphasis on corporate social responsibility (CSR). During recessions, while non-family firms tend to decrease their advertising intensities and rates of new product introduction (NPI), family firms are likely to maintain relatively high levels of advertising intensity and rates of NPI. Unlike non-family firms, family firms are also likely to maintain high levels of corporate social performance (CSP) during recessions. These results underscore the benefits of proactive marketing behavior and a continued emphasis on CSR during economic downturns.

Wages of internal movers, they find, were slightly more procyclical, and wages of external movers considerably more procyclical, than those of stayers. The greater cyclicality of movers' wages is particularly apparent for private sector workers and persons not covered by collective agreements. Nevertheless, because job stayers comprised about 90% of all observations in this large sample of British workers, the procyclicality of their wages was the predominant determinant of the overall procyclical pattern found across all groups. Thus, the analysis does not support the implication of some rigid wage models that employers use job title changes to adjust wages to the business cycle. © by Cornell University.","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-35748977816"

Drawing on feminist economic and stratification economic theories, this quantitative analysis suggests that the greatest losses were cashier jobs in the hotel and restaurant industry, and childcare worker positions in the healthcare and social services industry. These two occupations are low wage, dominated by women, and considered essential. This study posits that Black women disproportionately lost these jobs for three reasons: (1) Black women’s strong attachment to the US workforce; (2) Black women’s overrepresentation in the hotel/restaurant and healthcare/social services industries; and (3) women’s overrepresentation in low-wage occupations. The study offers policy solutions that could help sustain the Black community during the pandemic-inspired economic downturn. HIGHLIGHTS Black women face occupational segregation that is specific to both their gender and their race. Black women’s employment is more narrowly concentrated by industry than any other demographic group. Job losses due to COVID-19 especially hit industries in which Black women are concentrated. Black women lost the most jobs in the cashier occupation.

Sport masculinity now fills a vacuum left by the evacuation of traditional forms of masculinity, which are no longer available to the new generations of men. For them, the possibility of employment in the sport industries in the Global North has had a transformative effect, despite the extremely limited probability of success. During the same period of time, the world of sport has become commoditized, mediatized, and corporatized, transformations that have been spearheaded by the growing importance of privatized media interests. Professional athletes have become neoliberal subjects responsible for their own destiny in an increasingly demanding and unpredictable labor market. In Cameroon, Fiji, and Senegal, athletic hopefuls prospectively embody this new gendered subjectivity by mobilizing locally available instruments that most closely resemble neoliberal subjectivity, such as Pentecostalism and maraboutism. Through the conduit of sport, the masculine self has been transformed into a neoliberal subject in locations where this is least expected. What emerges is a new approach to masculinity that eschews explanations based on the simple recognition of diverse and hierarchically organized masculinities, and instead recognizes masculinity in its different manifestations as embedded, scalar, relational, and temporally situated. © Society for the Comparative Study of Society and History 2018Â.","Body; Cameroon; Fiji; Mobility; Neoliberalism; Religion; Senegal; Sport; Wordsmasculinity","Cameroon; Fiji; Senegal; employment; gender issue; labor market; masculinization; mobility; neoliberalism; religion; sport","Review","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85048966743"

This study focuses on the young adult labour force in Italy, investigating the relationship between employment insecurity and mental health and whether this has changed after years of economic downturn. It enhances understanding by addressing differences in mental health according to several employment characteristics; and by exploring the role of respondents' economic situation and educational level. Data and methods: Data from a large-scale, nationally representative health survey are used to estimate the relationship between employment insecurity and the Mental Health Inventory (MHI), by means of multiple linear regressions. Results and conclusions: The study demonstrates that employment insecurity is associated with poorer mental health. Moreover, neither temporary workers nor unemployed individuals are a homogeneous group. Previous job experience is important in differentiating the mental health risks of unemployed individuals; and the effects on mental health vary according to occupational status and to the amount of time spent in a condition of insecurity. Further, the experience of financial difficulties partly explains the relationship between employment insecurity and mental health; and different mental health outcomes depend on respondents' educational level. Lastly, the risks of reporting poorer mental health were higher in 2013 than in 2005. © 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Economic recession; Employment insecurity; Italy; Mental health; Young adult labour force","Adolescent; Adult; Cross-Sectional Studies; Economic Recession; Employment; Female; Health Surveys; Humans; Italy; Male; Mental Disorders; Risk Factors; Socioeconomic Factors; Unemployment; Young Adult; Italy; economic instability; educational attainment; employment; health impact; health status; labor supply; mental health; occupational exposure; working conditions; young population; adult; economic recession; employment; health survey; human; human experiment; Italy; job experience; mental health; multiple linear regression analysis; unemployment; worker; young adult; adolescent; cross-sectional study; employment; female; male; Mental Disorders; psychology; risk factor; socioeconomics; young adult","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84957895305"

The aggregate data reveal that an improvement in economic conditions produces a decrease in alcohol-related mortality. Microlevel data show that alcohol consumption increases during economic expansion while the probability of being a drinker remains unchanged. This demonstrates that alcohol-related mortality and self-reported alcohol consumption may be delinked in the short-run business cycle context. One explanation for this paradox is that most harmful forms of drinking are not captured in survey-based data used to study the effect of macroeconomic conditions on alcohol consumption.

Design/methodology/approach: A research study was designed and carried out in private sector Greek HEIs. Fifteen HEIs were approached through interviews based on a structured questionnaire. The measured variables of the TQM elements and results identified in the literature were used as the questionnaire items. Descriptive statistics were applied to determine the TQM elements mostly adopted and the results achieved by the HEIs. Findings: According to the findings, the TQM elements mostly adopted by the Greek HEIs concern the following: student focus, leadership and top management commitment, strategic quality planning, process management and teaching staff and employee involvement. On the other hand, the most significant results achieved by the sample HEIs concern quality performance improvement, teaching staff and employee satisfaction, operational performance improvement and the positive impact on society. Research limitations/implications: The subjective data collection involved chief executive officers of a small sample of HEIs operating in a European Union country. Thus, no advanced statistical methods could be applied. Based on these limitations, future research studies are recommended. Practical implications: By focusing on specific TQM elements, an HEI can develop a robust TQM model, approach business excellence, which can, in turn, help the HEI apply for appropriate quality awards, and finally derive significant benefits. In doing so, an HEI can lay the foundations for being competitive in the current global context that is characterised by an economic downturn. Originality/value: This study contributes to the literature by empirically determining the TQM elements mostly adopted as well as the respective results achieved by Greek HEIs in a period of economic downturn. This is the first research study in the field of TQM in higher education that has been carried out in Greece in a period where many service organisations, whether private or public, are making significant efforts to withstand the current downturn and achieve a sustainable growth. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Greece; Higher education institutions; Total quality management","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85017324654"

Focusing on the second of these failures, this paper makes two contributions. First, I review research since the crisis on the role of credit factors in the decisions of households, firms, and financial intermediaries and in macroeconomic modeling. This research provides broad support for the view that credit market developments deserve greater attention from macroeconomists, not only for analyzing the economic effects of financial crises but in the study of ordinary business cycles as well. Second, I provide new evidence on the channels by which the recent nancial crisis depressed economic activity in the United States. Although the deterioration of household balance sheets and the associated deleveraging likely exacerbated the initial economic downturn and the slowness of the recovery, I find that the unusual severity of the Great Recession was due primarily to the panic in funding and securitization markets, which disrupted the supply of credit. This finding helps to justify the government’s extraordinary efforts to stem the panic in order to avoid greater damage to the real economy. © 2018, Brookings Institution Press.

This paper investigates the impact of higher NPL ratios on the availability of bank credit among international lenders and emerging market borrowers. The paper finds that a rise in NPL ratios in both lender and borrower countries is positively associated with higher banking outflows from emerging market economies. Two additional features emerge in the patterns of cross-border banking flows when NPL ratios rise that are related to international credit market imperfections. First, lenders are more responsive to a rise in NPL ratios of same-region borrowers. This is consistent with the “reversion to the mean’’ effect given their generally high exposures to the same-region borrowers. Second, while a high share of US-dollar-denominated debt is generally positively associated with withdrawals of funds from emerging market borrowers, lenders are less responsive to a rise in NPL ratios in emerging market economies if their liabilities are denominated more in US dollars. The results are in line with the “original sin redux” hypothesis. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Banking flows; Emerging market economies; Nonperforming loans; Regional lenders; US dollar denomination","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85109096505"

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and UK government have therefore called on commissioners to consider opportunities for 'disinvestment'- the cessation or restriction of health-care practices, and subsequent shift of resources to higher value care. However, there are no clear guidelines on how to approach disinvestment, and little is known about how this is tackled in practice. This paper presents results from a study that used ethnographic methods to investigate how disinvestment is understood and enacted. Eight routine local-level commissioning meetings where resource allocation decisions were discussed were observed over one year in two demographically contrasting regions of England. 28 interviews accompanied observations, conducted with purposefully-sampled professionals who were involved in, or potentially impacted by, disinvestments. Analysis of interviews/meeting recordings was undertaken using constant comparison methods, complemented by observational field notes. We found variation in informants' reported definitions of disinvestment, and an absence of disinvestment decision-making in observed meetings. Observations and interviews showed evidence of practical and ideological barriers to disinvestment, including an absence of tools and capacity, difficulties in collaboration and communication, a reluctance to engage in explicit rationing, and a perceived lack of central/political support. These findings support the need for the development of methods to encourage and guide disinvestment, including a clear definition of what 'disinvestment' entails. Crucially, disinvestment needs to be a collaborative effort, involving health-care providers and commissioners in decision-making processes. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Commissioning; Disinvestment; Healthcare; Priority-setting; Qualitative; Rationing; UK","Anthropology, Cultural; Decision Making; England; Health Care Rationing; Health Priorities; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Organizational Policy; State Medicine; England; United Kingdom; decision making; global economy; guideline; health care; ideology; resource allocation; service provision; Article; cost control; cost effectiveness analysis; ethnography; financial management; funding; health care disinvestment; health care practice; health service; interview; medical decision making; patient safety; resource allocation; cultural anthropology; decision making; economics; health care organization; health care planning; human; national health service; policy; United Kingdom","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84921640588"

Design/methodology/approach: In-depth interviews with hoteliers were conducted to unveil their dynamic capabilities amid the pandemic as regard adjustments and performance of self-service technology (SST)-based strategies. Thematic analysis was used to analyze the data. Findings: Data analysis revealed four types of dynamic capabilities (i.e. sensing, learning, integrating and coordinating capabilities). Equipped with these capabilities, hotels made minor adjustments to their SST strategies. In general, during an economic downturn, hotels refrained from introducing new SSTs. SSTs introduced before the pandemic were used more frequently and received enhanced customer feedback. The findings further revealed that the factors influencing hotels’ application of SSTs before and after the outbreak of COVID-19 remained similar. Originality/value: This is the first research integrating CP, dynamic capabilities and strategic management process to explain how hotels adjust technological strategies to recover in a suddenly changed environment.

Paid work by women has increased sharply, as has family instability. Education-related inequality in work hours and income has grown. These changes, says Suzanne Bianchi, pose differing work-life issues for parents at different points along the income distribution. Between 1975 and 2009, the labor force rate of mothers with children under age eighteen increased from 47.4 percent to 71.6 percent. Mothers today also return to work much sooner after the birth of a child than did mothers half a century ago. High divorce rates and a sharp rise in the share of births to unmarried mothers mean that more children are being raised by a single parent, usually their mother. Workplaces too have changed, observes Bianchi. Today's employees increasingly work nonstandard hours. The well-being of highly skilled workers and less-skilled workers has been diverging. For the former, work hours may be long, but income has soared. For lower-skill workers, the lack of ""good jobs"" disconnects fathers from family obligations. Men who cannot find work or have low earnings potential are much less likely to marry. For low-income women, many of whom are single parents, the work-family dilemma is how to care adequately for children and work enough hours to support them financially. Jobs for working-class and lower middle-class workers are relatively stable, except in economic downturns, but pay is low, and both parents must work full time to make ends meet. Family income is too high to qualify for government subsidized child care, but too low to afford highquality care in the private market. These families struggle to have a reasonable family life and provide for their family's economic well-being. Bianchi concludes that the ""work and family"" problem has no one solution because it is not one problem. Some workers need more work and more money. Some need to take time off around the birth of a child without permanently derailing a fulfilling career. Others need short-term support to attend to a family health crisis. How best to meet this multiplicity of needs is the challenge of the coming decade.","","Adolescent; Adult; Child; Child, Preschool; Divorce; Family; Female; Forecasting; Health Services Needs and Demand; Humans; Income; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Parental Leave; Parenting; Pregnancy; Single-Parent Family; Social Change; Unemployment; United States; Women, Working; Work Schedule Tolerance; Workplace; adolescent; adult; article; child; child parent relation; divorce; family; family leave; female; forecasting; health service; human; income; infant; male; newborn; pregnancy; preschool child; psychological aspect; single parent; social change; unemployment; United States; work schedule; workplace","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84855528693"

Studies that do suggest unemployment causes crime and imprisonment have used methodological techniques which, especially in over‐time studies, could lead to the acceptance of spurious effects caused by trend and lag as evidence of a true relationship. Using data over a six‐year period for the United States, a panel model is specified in which appropriate controls for intra‐series trend and cross‐series lagged effects are included. Although bivariate correlations are strongly suggestive of a relationship between unemployment and crime, results of the panel approach suggest that most of the apparent relationship is due to common trend effects. Little evidence is found for the existence of a relationship between crime/imprisonment and unemployment, regardless of the type of effect considered. In addition, results from stability tests indicate that the crime‐unemployment relationship has been unstable. while the unemployment‐imprisonment relationship has been relatively invariant.

Design/methodology/approach – A research study was carried out in 140 Greek manufacturing companies by means of a questionnaire. The questionnaire was sent by e-mail and it was requested that it should be answered by a company representative. Exploratory factor analysis is applied in order to extract the latent factors of performance measures. The differences between the ISO 9001 certified and non-certified manufacturing companies are determined through non-parametric tests such as the w2-test and the Mann-Whitney U-test. Findings – The ISO 9001 certified manufacturing companies significantly outperform the non-certified with regard to product quality, customer satisfaction, operational, market and financial performance. This is evident in a business environment where an economic downturn and financial crisis dominates. Research limitations/implications – The sub-samples of the responding ISO 9001 certified and non-certified manufacturing companies are small sized and they are limited to small- and medium-sized enterprises. The subjective character of the data collected through the company representatives involves the risk of receiving biased responses regarding the performance measures. The above limitations suggest future research recommendations. Practical implications – The increased performancemeasures of the ISO 9001 certified manufacturing companies may motivate the non-certified ones to implement the ISO 9001 standard and apply for the certification in order to increase their performance and withstand the current economic downturn and financial crisis. The present study may also stimulate manufacturing companies to adopt traditional and modern benchmarking techniques, in an additional effort to improve their businesses and competitiveness.

By using data obtained from eight Asia-Pacific countries over the period 1976 to 2003 and a fixed-effects model to conduct the regression analysis, the results of this study indicate that unemployment rate is negatively and significantly correlated with total mortality and mortality rates from cardiovascular diseases, motor vehicle accidents and infant mortality. These findings are consistent with the view that health may improve during economic downturns. In addition, suicide is found to move countercyclically with economic fluctuations. Socioeconomic factors such as age and gender also play important roles in affecting the mortality rates. The results also show that unemployment has a stronger immediate and contemporaneous, rather than a sustained, effect on mortality rates. Finally, this study concludes that the effects of economic fluctuations on health outcome tend to lead to erroneous conclusions if the fixed-effects problems are neglected.

This article examines those questions in the area of financial management. A basic challenge for state governments is to maintain budgetary stability and program predictability in face of economic downturns. State governments can best meet this challenge by developing what we call countercyclical fiscal capacity (CCFC). We present the concept of CCFC as the creation and use of financial tools that help state governments maintain countercyclical spending and program stability during revenue shocks. We operationalize the concept in terms of fiscal reserves that are used to mitigate emergency-spending cuts and tax increases and analyze the operation of such reserves over a period that includes recessions in 1991 and 2001. We find evidence of the efficacy of CCFC and argue for greater investments in this aspect of government capacity.","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-37249013800"

This study of China's economic performance against the recent Asian financial turmoil suggests that the Chinese central state has played a crucial role in the growth and restructuring of the national economy. The immediate impact of the financial crisis on China has been limited although the long-term effects remain uncertain. China has so far narrowly escaped the crisis primarily because of a state-led capital injection in mid-1998 to stop economic downturn, an austerity program that led the overheated economy to 'soft-land' prior to the crisis, and stringent state control of capital flow into and out of the country. Contrary to the 'end of the nation-state' claim made by many globalization prophets, the Chinese socialist state has remained an active agent interacting with global market forces. The interplay between the socialist state and transnational capital has been a place-specific phenomenon despite the pervasive assertion of 'the end of geography'. A dialectical approach is needed for analyzing the triangular nexus of interaction between the central state, local state, and global market forces in China in the current age of volatile globalization.","","China; financial crisis; globalization; political economy; state role","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0034025937"

We find important asymmetries in the responses to Chinese uncertainty shocks of macro-variables especially for the United States (US), the Euro Area (EA) and South Korea. Indeed, these countries display almost no response to the identified shock during booms. However, when hit in downturns, they suffer from a fall in industrial production, inflation and exports together with an increase in unemployment (except for Korea). Emerging countries (Brazil and Russia) stand out in the extent to which they significantly respond to the Chinese shock in both identified regimes. Lastly, the Japanese economy seems to be less sensitive to the Chinese shock. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","China; Economic policy uncertainty; Spillover effects; STVAR","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85047245210"

In particular, the demise of hierarchical and group structures has been predicted, together with the end of distinctive HRM features such as lifetime employment and seniority-based pay. Using interview-based empirical data with a variety of Japanese organizations, this paper argues that such organizations are indeed moving towards flatter, less hierarchical structures. Moreover, there are marked shifts in HRM practices. In particular, the seniority-based pay system has been subject to reform. However, other practices have proved considerably more robust than the popular literature would suggest. For example, the lifetime employment system, although under significant pressure, remains largely intact. Indeed, we will argue that certain other key practices are being sacrificed to maintain job security.

The history of Canada's immigration policy has been defined by an ongoing battle between proponents of using immigration for long term (economic growth and demographic) goals and proponents of using it for short-term (current labour market) goals. In the past, a concern with the ""absorptive capacity"" of the economy has affected immigration levels, with alternating periods of large inflows targeted at specific economic goals and periods of drastic cutbacks in numbers during economic downturns. By abandoning the concept of absorptive capacity, as traditionally defined, Canada's current immigration policy is dramatically different from historical norms. This is signalled most clearly by the failure to cut back the number of immigrants during the labour market difficulties of the 1990s. Current policy appears to be based on the idea that immigration generates economic growth and thus represents a victory for the proponents of the long term view of immigration policy. Unfortunately, the government provides little evidence to support the claim that long term growth benefits offset short term costs in a poor labour market. Questions, therefore, remain about why the shift in policy has occurred. © 2004 by the Institute of Urban Studies All rights of reproduction in any form reserved.","Canada; History; Immigration; Policy","Canada; North America; economic growth; immigration policy; labor migration; policy analysis","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-2142702883"

Design/methodology/approach - Bearing in mind the definition of ISO 9001 effectiveness, the ISO 9001 objectives and their indicators are identified in the literature. Based on these indicators, a measurement instrument is developed and then empirically validated through collecting preliminary data from 335 Greek food manufacturing small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). After testing the assumptions of multivariate analysis, exploratory factor analysis as well as first and second order confirmatory factor analysis are applied. Findings - The data collected reveal, as identified in the literature, the three-dimensional nature of the ISO 9001 objectives (continuous improvement, prevention of nonconformities and customer satisfaction focus). The responding food manufacturing SMEs demonstrate a high level of achievement of these objectives. Further analysis of the data also reveals a valid latent factor reflecting the successful achievement of the ISO 9001 objectives, namely ISO 9001 effectiveness. Research limitations/implications - The present study focuses on food manufacturing SMEs. Therefore, it is worth validating the measurement instrument on large food manufacturing companies, food service companies, companies of specific food sub-sectors, non-food companies and finally on companies operating in different economic conditions to Greece. Practical implications - This measurement instrument can be used by a food manufacturing SME as a self assessment tool and a benchmarking tool. In doing so, suitable strategies can be selected in order for a food SME to improve quality, gain competitive advantage and overcome the current downturn.

During this period of uncertainty and economic downturn, many customers are questioning their ways of living and being, and thus businesses are engaging customers in new and evolving ways. To appreciate this broadened realm of engagement requires researchers and businesses to embrace existential humanism as an alternative, yet complementary, paradigmatic lens. Design/methodology/approach: This is a conceptual paper. The authors consider three distinct paradigmatic lenses on human (inter)action—economic rationalism, institutionalism and existential humanism—and apply these lenses to deepen the underlying theorizing of the customer engagement concept. Further, the authors illustrate how customers engage with businesses in distinct ways, seeking meaning congruent with the challenges faced during COVID-19. Findings: The authors argue that the common tripartite model of cognitive, emotional and behavioral customer engagement, typically informed by reductionist and unilateral paradigmatic lenses, is insufficient to understand why customers seek to engage with businesses during and after COVID-19. Originality/value: In providing a broader paradigmatic perspective, the authors make a plea for a stronger consideration and activation of spiritual engagement in marketing. The current COVID-19 environment challenges extant philosophical assumptions of engagement theorizing, which we address by way of existential humanism. The authors contribute through a more differentiated perspective of engagement, accounting for a broader spectrum of human experience. This enables more informed theorizing across levels of abstraction, while emphasizing diverse avenues for future engagement for a time even beyond COVID-19. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","COVID-19; Customer engagement; Existential humanism; Institutionalism; Spiritual engagement","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85088803166"

Empirical results show that the dynamic correlation between Bitcoin and Islamic stock markets is low and usually negative during major economic and political events suggesting that Bitcoin qualifies as a safe haven against Islamic stock markets downturns. Extending our analysis to portfolio management, findings reveal that the diversification benefits of Bitcoin are most times stable and increase significantly during turbulent periods.

While some of the results are consistent with prior quantitative and comparative research, others are not. For example, in line with other studies, the article finds that autocracies are more likely to make a transition to democracy when they offer broader protections for civil liberties, experience a change in political leadership, or suffer an economic downturn. At the same time, the analysis does not support the claim that transitions in neighbouring countries directly improve prospects for a transition to democracy, or that economic decline and presidential systems heighten the risk of democratic breakdown. Perhaps most intriguing, our model of transitions to democracy also identifies a new twist on old stories linking economic development to democratization. For countries under authoritarian rule that have attempted democracy before, the research here indicates that development does improve prospects for another attempt, as modernization theory suggests. For countries with no democratic experience, however, affluence conveys no direct democratizing benefit and appears, if anything, to help sustain authoritarian rule.","Autocracy; Democracy; Event history analysis; Forecasting; Transitions","authoritarianism; democracy; democratization; economic development; leadership; modeling; modernization; political change","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-34249727767"

We applied a conceptual framework encompassing relations between institutional changes, actors’ behaviors, and land use changes to investigate the dynamic trajectories and institutional mechanisms of rural land use in Huishan, a suburban district located in eastern China. We argue that by reshaping local actors’ behaviors, institutional changes and national strategies have significantly influenced the transition of China's rural settlements. Over a period of about two decades, rural settlements in Huishan underwent expansion followed by shrinkage in recent years, which has resulted in a gradual decrease in the total scale of land use. A parallel trend of rural economic diversification has prompted a shift in the previously residential land-based structure of land use toward a more diversified structure mainly entailing residential and industrial land. However, with the macroeconomic downturn and the return of migrant laborers to their home regions, rural hollowing and the reluctance of local actors to consolidate residential land may pose severe future challenges for these settlements. In conclusion, we suggest that appropriate regulatory policies for rural settlements in transition that incorporate key requirements such as increasing employment and rehabilitating derelict rural construction land are required. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Institutional change; Land use dynamics; Local actors; Rural settlements; Rural transition; Suburban China","China; Jiangsu; Wuxi [Jiangsu]; conceptual framework; economic diversification; institutional reform; land use; local economy; macroeconomics; rural economy","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85033361919"

To richer areas like the old EU-15, poor areas next door often appear as both threat and opportunity. Some EU-15 actors - mostly corporations, but also many European liberals - saw in CE a chance for new markets, new workers and new investment opportunities for the core EU-15 economies. They tried to codify new conditions of production and sale that they thought beneficial, but other EU-15 actors worried about competition from CE on capital, labor and product markets. The fearful - mostly EU-15 states and the EU itself but sometimes firms headquartered in the EU-15 - acted to try to minimize these potential threats. I show that, as a broad proposition, actors motivated by the threats seem to have shaped conditions more than those motivated by opportunity. Data from financial flows, trade in goods and services, and labor migration illustrate this central point.

This paper seeks directly to address this research void by reviewing relevant literature spanning the past 20 years and building an integrative framework for future research efforts. Design/methodology/approach – The paper systematically reviews and compartmentalizes articles on the intersection between firm strategy and economic recession published between 1991 and 2010 in widely recognized management and entrepreneurship journals. Concurrently, a theoretical framework is proposed which identifies distinct constructs and linkages related to economic recessions, strategy, and performance. Findings – The findings are twofold. First, the review distils disparate scholarly works on firm behavior and recessions to provide a systematic appraisal and review of what people know and do not know about managing firms through economic downturn. Second, the conceptual framework points to numerous opportunities to scholars interested in conducting research on this timely and important topic. Practical implications – The paper answers a call by scholars for research that fills a void on systematic diagnosis, prescription, or prophylaxis that can guide managers through recessions.

The youth unemployment rate expanded from 15.5 in 2007 to 25.5 in 2013. Beyond the consequences for individuals youth unemployment as a mass phenomenon is potentially menacing the stability of democratic societies. Hence there are good reasons to fight youth unemployment by any means. The paper analyses the specific structure and causes of youth unemployment. Although youth unemployment is also influenced by individual factors like insufficient qualification, we show that country-specific factors - institutions, traditions and characteristic structures - are of high importance in explaining the huge disparities between European countries. Using panel data estimates with specific country and time fixed effects we show that especially the Mediterranean countries responded to the economic downturn in a specific way. However, the high correlation of changes in the youth and adult unemployment rates across countries points to the fact that not only structural factors but also business cycle effects are important for explaining the sharp increase in the youth unemployment rate in Europe. The rise in joblessness is in fact closely related to macroeconomic slackness. Therefore, we argue that a two-handed approach combining institutional improvements with growth stimulating measures is needed to overcome the problem. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84956620447"

We find little effect of job losses on the white teen birthrate. For black teens, however, job losses to 1 % of the working-age population decrease the birthrate by around 2 %. Birth declines start five months after the job loss and then last for more than one year. Linking the timing of job losses and conceptions suggests that black teen births decline because of increased terminations and perhaps also because of changes in prepregnancy behaviors. National data on risk behaviors also provide evidence that black teens reduce sexual activity and increase contraception use in response to job losses. Job losses seven to nine months after conception do not affect teen birthrates, indicating that teens do not anticipate job losses and lending confidence that job losses are ""shocks"" that can be viewed as quasi-experimental variation.

Our analysis shows that overinvestment of an energy firm is positively affected by its political connection. In terms of the “helping hand” effects, we find that politically connected energy firms are more likely overinvest when they receive more government subsidy.

Given the burgeoning academic interest in the role of digital transformation in corporate decision-making, we focus on its implications for tax management decisions. This study aims to test the association between digital transformation and tax stickiness and the mediating effect of tax avoidance. Theoretically, we use an information processing view to incorporate digital transformation into tax research. Empirically, we use the fixed effects model to verify our hypotheses based on the fine-grained panel data of Chinese publicly listed enterprises from 2007 to 2019. Results show that (a) digital transformation significantly reduces tax stickiness, (b) digital transformation alleviates tax stickiness by enhancing tax avoidance, and (c) the alleviating effect of digital transformation on tax stickiness is more prominent in companies with weak internal control and regions with low tax enforcement and high environmental uncertainty. Our findings hold after a range of robustness tests. Our results confirm the importance of digital transformation for tax management and provide new insights for enterprises to reduce tax stickiness through digital transformation. Our study also has important practical implications for business managers and policymakers. © 2022","Digital transformation; Environmental uncertainty; Internal control; Tax avoidance; Tax enforcement; Tax stickiness","China; Decision making; Environmental management; Corporates; Decisions makings; Digital transformation; Economic downturn; Environmental uncertainty; Internal controls; Tax avoidance; Tax enforcement; Tax managements; Tax stickiness; corporate strategy; decision making; tax system; uncertainty analysis; Taxation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138112452"

The welfare gain is larger when the government interventions are more front loaded, given that the government injects the same amount of liquidity in terms of present value.

State-level PBB is analyzed according to four elements: (1) the development of performance measures, (2) its applicability to budgeting and management processes, (3) its utility across the business cycle, and (4) its usefulness for budget players. An analytical framework is devised that highlights the ""publicness"" of American government, draws on the principal-agent model, and considers incentive mechanisms theory. Findings confirm that a good performance measurement system takes time to develop and operate well and that PBB functions more effectively for executive management than legislative purposes. PBB is used more by the states during strong economic times as opposed to during economic downturns. More importantly, PBB is only selectively applied by legislators in most states, whereas top executive policy makers, middle managers, and staff embrace and utilize PBB systems more extensively. © 2011 The American Society for Public Administration.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-79955775126"

Focusing on credit cards, we use data from four releases of the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF), 1983-1995, to trace the evolution of the debt position of the poor as compared to that of the population at large. The data indicate that from 1983 to 1995 the fraction of poor households with a credit card more than doubled, and the average balances held on these cards rose almost as rapidly as the balances of nonpoor households. In 1983, fewer than 1 in 30 poor households had credit card debts greater than twice their monthly incomes; by 1995, more than 1 in 8 did. There is no strong evidence at the moment that the added debt has increased the financial distress of these households.

If the current decline in housing starts and residential investment echoes the declines of the last three housing downturns, we estimate that gross national product (GNP) growth will be reduced by close to 3 per cent.

In developing economies, business leaders often cite poor business acumen and little real-world experience as serious shortcomings in the domestic pool of applicants. In addition to the skills shortage, businesses are currently confronting a global economic crisis, which has seen many economies slump into recession. Despite this economic downturn, Australia has continued to thrive as a destination of choice for international students. As the reputation of Australia's work-integrated learning (WIL) expertise grows, so too does its international following. Offering some of the more robust project-based learning experiences, Australian universities have become the first choice for many international students seeking to enhance their workplace readiness. Two Australian institutions attracting attention for their approaches to WIL are Griffith University, with its flagship Industrial Affiliates Program (IAP), and Queensland University of Technology (QUT), which has funded an in-depth learning and teaching project designed to facilitate the embedding of authentic real-world learning experiences across the entire curriculum. This paper uses a case study approach to highlight the experiences of Griffith University's IAP students and considers QUT's current research projects. It also explores the implications for Australian tertiary institutions seeking to work with organisations to produce graduates who can respond to the changing economic circumstances and who can add value to global organisations in periods of uncertainty. © 2010 HERDSA.","Global economic crisis; Global skills shortage; Industrial affiliates program; International students; Placement; Work-integrated learning","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-77956412027"

Across three studies, well-educated graduates who entered the workforce during economic downturns were more satisfied with their current jobs than those who entered during more prosperous economic times. Study 1 showed that economic conditions at college graduation predicted later job satisfaction even after accounting for different industry and occupational choices. Study 2 replicated these results and found that recession-era graduates were more satisfied with their jobs both early and later in their careers and even when they earned less money. A third cross-sectional study showed that people who entered the workforce in bad economies were less likely to entertain upward counterfactuals, or thoughts about how they might have done better, and more likely to feel grateful for their jobs, both of which mediated the relationship between economic conditions at workforce entry and job satisfaction. While past research on job satisfaction has focused largely on situational and dispositional antecedents, these results suggest that early workforce conditions also can have lasting implications for how people affectively evaluate their jobs. © The Author(s) 2013.","gratitude; imprinting; job satisfaction; recession-era graduates; upward counterfactuals; workforce economic conditions","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84887564988"

This finding is robust across alternate indicators of economic activity which include stock prices, corporate profits and business cycles, and across different types of cases. The finding of countercyclical case activity does not appear to lend support to interest-group theories that predict greater regulatory protection towards producers during economic contractions. One interpretation of our result would be that antitrust violations tend to increase during economic downturns, leading to an increase in the number of cases initiated, the broad implication being that the Antitrust Division primarily acts as an antitrust law enforcement agency.

According to a Gartner press release from June 2008, Cloud Computing will be ""no less influential than e-business"" (Gartner 2008a). The positive attitude towards the importance and influence of Cloud Computing resulted in optimistic Cloud-related market forecasts. In October 2008, IDC (2008b) forecasted an almost threefold growth of spending on Cloud services until 2012, reaching $42 billion. Same analyst firm reported that the cost advantage associated with the Cloud model becomes even more attractive in the economic downturn (IDC 2008b).

Participants who reported higher levels of financial strain engaged in lower levels of all but one of the five health behaviors, but there were no significant main effects of a change in the number of hours worked per week or change in employment status.

The crisis had large repercussions for the welfare of many citizens and it generated cutbacks in virtually all social policy programmes. This halted a welfare-state expansion that had been going on for decades. It also caused great concern about the state of welfare of the nation. In 1999 the Swedish Government appointed a 'Welfare Commission', a team of academic researchers who were assigned the task of drawing up a balance sheet for the development of welfare in the 1990s. The Commission delivered its final report in October 2001. This article is a condensed account of one of the more central issues for the Commission; namely, how the unemployment crisis affected already socially and economically vulnerable groups. Looking at the development over the entire decade, three groups stand out as particularly disadvantaged in terms of individual welfare resources: young adults, immigrants and single mothers. The downturn for these groups was especially accentuated in terms of employment and income. Young people and immigrants trying to get into the labour market during the crisis years faced the problems of newcomers to the systems of social protection. The poor economic development for single mothers could essentially be attributed to the shortage of work in general and of full-time work in particular that followed from the unemployment crisis. As a consequence, the importance of selective benefits increased and the relative size of all public transfers - despite rationing measures - stayed fairly unchanged. The results highlight the great influence of macroeconomic conditions and policy making for the welfare of vulnerable groups in society.","Immigrants; Single mothers; Swedish welfare; Unemployment crisis; Welfare commission; Young adults","Sweden; social policy; unemployment; welfare provision","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0242404276"

In addition, as the global economy has been suffering from a severe downturn, which likely influences perceptions and attitudes, this article tests the impact of resident perception of economic crisis on their perception of tourism and their willingness to support its development. Results indicate that those who perceive a higher level of economic crisis are more likely to view the impacts of tourism positively and support its development. Results also show that higher level of place attachment among residents is associated with a higher level of tourism development support.

Design/methodology/approach: The paper's design is a comparative policy analysis approach using international working time, paternity, maternity and parental leave data from selected rich, middle and poorer income nations. Leave policies are examined in relation to the place of fathers in the work-family policy mix between 2010 and 2011. Findings: Short well-compensated paternity leave provision is emerging in poorer and middle income countries but none offer the range of father-targeted parental leave innovation observed in some richer nations. A comparison of leave policy changes effecting fathers between 2010 and 2011 showed resilience in face of economic downturn particularly in European countries. Research limitations/implications: Global data on fathers' working hours, paternity leave and men's access to parental leave are difficult to access and more effort in data standardisation is required to build on this study. Practical implications: Inter-governmental bodies play an important role in the promotion of father-friendly employment measures even in countries with strong male breadwinner cultures. Originality/value: This policy analysis extends scholarship on how societies promote and regulate cultural constructions of fatherhood in families and in the workplace. It suggests that drivers to fit fathers into work-family policies are mixed and do not easily map on to country classifications or policy regimes. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Economic crisis; Economic cycles; Employment; Family life; Fathers; Parental leave; Paternity leave; Recession; Social policy; Work-family policies","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84883086421"

We estimate a time-varying parameter vector autoregression (TVP-VAR) with stochastic volatility à la Primiceri (2005) for euro area countries, and we identify the structural shocks by imposing sign restrictions on impulse response functions based on the theoretical model by Gerali etal. (2010). The results suggest that credit supply shocks have been an important driver of business cycle fluctuations in euro area countries, and that their effects on the economy have generally increased since the recent crisis. More specifically, we find evidence that credit supply shocks contributed positively to output growth during the pre-crisis period and negatively during the downturn in economic activity in 2008-2009 in all the countries considered. In the post-crisis period, by contrast, we observe a strong rise in cross-country heterogeneity, reflecting financial fragmentation in the euro area associated with the sovereign debt crisis and weaker banks' balance sheets. Although this heterogeneity across euro area countries started to decline around 2012, the contribution of credit supply shocks to GDP growth and credit growth remained negative in most euro area countries in mid-2013 (the end of our sample), suggesting that constraints in the supply of credit continued to weaken economic activity. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","C11; C32; Credit supply shocks; E32; E51; Euro area; Sign restrictions; TVP-VAR","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84926192965"

However, the results are significant for countries with market-based financial systems but not for countries with bank-based financial systems. Emerging markets have mainly bank-based financial systems, which may explain why these markets require more time to recover from economic downturns after a financial crisis. Therefore, we argue that governments should emphasize a balanced financial system structure as it helps countries to recover from financial crises more quickly compared with countries that lack such balanced structures. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Financial crises; Financial reform; Financial system structure","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84865812117"

For example, the complex network approach focuses on network robustness and resilience due to route interruptions during a relatively short period. Also seasonal interruptions of air routes are a well-documented phenomenon in the context of demand variability. However, only recently discussions emerge on the more permanent cessation of air routes, the route churn. Today, European low-cost carriers frequently apply route churn in their networks. To enable early route churn detection in these networks, a regression model is developed in which route characteristics explain the churning likelihood of individual routes. The results of the econometric analysis show that churn rates are higher during an economic downturn, within the Eastern European market, between the Eastern and the Mediterranean market and between primary airports. In addition, we find that distance and the number of seats offered have a significant negative effect on the churn likelihood. The results also show significant effects of market share, seasonality and route age on the chance of cessation. To conclude, the paper demonstrates substantial differences in churn behaviour amongst specific low-cost carriers. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Low-cost carrier; Network continuity; Route churn; Seasonality","Eastern Europe; air traffic; air transportation; airline industry; airport; econometrics; regression analysis; routing; seasonality","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84955170453"

Public support for them is still shallow and fragile, and they are still greeted with ambivalence by the Hong Kong people. What is most important - as far as the future prospect of political parties is concerned - is that the partial nature of democratization in Hong Kong and the political context wherein parties were formed are impediments to their development. More specifically, these two factors make it difficult for parties to broaden their base of social support through changing their political positions and policy platforms. Yet the new political situation in Hong Kong brought about by the return of the territory to China and the abrupt economic downturn suffered by Hong Kong in the wake of the Asian financial turmoil does make changes along these lines imperative. Consequently, political parties have found themselves 'captives' of history and the past policies of both Britain and China. This article discusses the effects of partial democratization and the 'foundation moment' on the political parties of Hong Kong. The data on the public attitudes towards political parties come from a questionnaire survey conducted immediately after the Legislative Council elections held on 24 May 1998.","","China; Hong Kong; democratization; party politics; post-colonialism; public attitude","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0033807985"

We find the rating agencies provide financial markets with new tradable information. Specifically, they affect not only the instrument being rated (bonds) but also stocks. Interestingly, bond markets react differently than stock markets in many respects. We find, only for bond market returns, a positive impact is significant when the economic outlook is upgraded and outlook changes appear to be at least as important as rating changes. In addition, downgraded ratings and economic outlooks occur mainly during bond market downturns, raising a possibility that rating agencies may exacerbate a bond bear market. Only downgrade has a discernible impact on equity and bond returns and the effects of rating announcement are significantly asymmetric. On equity returns, the market responses of downgrade are more pronounced in the cases of high inflation, low fiscal balance, and local currency debt; in contrast, the market responses of downgrade across class are more pronounced in the cases of low current account and foreign currency debt. On bond returns, the market responses of downgrade are more pronounced in the cases of a relatively ailing economy as proxied by emerging market, high inflation, and low current account; on the other hand, the market responses of downgrade across class are more pronounced in the cases of a relatively healthy economy as proxied by low inflation, high liquidity, and during non-crisis period.

In Inequality in the Workplace, Jiyeoun Song focuses on South Korea and Japan, which have advanced labor market reform and confronted the rapid rise of a split in labor markets between protected regular workers andunderprotected and underpaid nonregular workers. The two countries have implemented very different strategies in response to the pressure to increase labor market flexibility during economic downturns. Japanese policy makers, Song finds, have relaxed the rules and regulations governing employment and working conditions for part-time, temporary, and fixed-term contract employees while retaining extensive protections for full-time permanent workers. In Korea, by contrast, politicians have weakened employment protections for all categories of workers. In her comprehensive survey of the politics of labor market reform in East Asia, Song argues that institutional features of the labor market shape the national trajectory of reform. More specifically, she shows how the institutional characteristics of the employment protection system and industrial relations, including the size and strength of labor unions, determine the choice between liberalization for the nonregular workforce and liberalization for all as well as the degree of labor market inequality in the process of reform. © 2014 by Cornell University.

The lessons that have been learned from good practices by various countries include containing the virus rapidly; enforcing containment measures; growing COVID-19 testing capability; discovering cures; providing stimulus packages to the affected; easing monetary policies; developing new pandemic-related industries; support plans for controlling unemployment; and overcoming inequalities. Coordination and multi-term planning have been found to be the key among the successful national and global endeavors to fight the pandemic. The current research and practice have mainly focused on specific aspects of COVID-19 response. There is a need to automate the learning process such that we can learn from good and bad practices during pandemics and normal times. To this end, this paper proposes a technology-driven framework, iResponse, for coordinated and autonomous pandemic management, allowing pandemic-related monitoring and policy enforcement, resource planning and provisioning, and data-driven planning and decision-making. The framework consists of five modules: Monitoring and Break-the-Chain, Cure Development and Treatment, Resource Planner, Data Analytics and Decision Making, and Data Storage and Management. All modules collaborate dynamically to make coordinated and informed decisions. We provide the technical system architecture of a system based on the proposed iResponse framework along with the design details of each of its five components. The challenges related to the design of the individual modules and the whole system are discussed. We provide six case studies in the paper to elaborate on the different functionalities of the iResponse framework and how the framework can be implemented. These include a sentiment analysis case study, a case study on the recognition of human activities, and four case studies using deep learning and other data-driven methods to show how to develop sustainability-related optimal strategies for pandemic management using seven real-world datasets.

We focus on the role of business cycle conditions and external constraints at the time of reform implementation (or of a credible commitment to it) in shaping the dynamic effects of such policies. Product market reform is modeled as a reduction in entry costs and takes place in a non-traded sector that produces services used as input in manufacturing production. Labor market reform is modeled as a reduction in firing costs and/or unemployment benefits. We find that business cycle conditions at the time of deregulation significantly affect adjustment. A reduction of firing costs entails larger and more persistent adverse short-run effects on employment and output when implemented in a recession. By contrast, a reduction in unemployment benefits boosts employment and output by more in a recession compared to normal times. The impact of product market reforms is less sensitive to business cycle conditions. Credible announcements about future reforms induce sizable short-run dynamics, regardless of whether the announcement takes place in normal times or during an economic downturn. Whether the immediate effect is expansionary or contractionary varies across reforms. Finally, lack of access to international lending in the wake of reform can amplify the costs of adjustment. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Business cycle; External borrowing constraint; Labor market; Product market; Structural reforms","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84997047738"

While the stock of Chinese FDI in Europe is still minuscule, the flows show the rapidly growing interest of Chinese companies in being present in Europe, both through greenfield investment and through mergers and acquisitions. This surge of Chinese FDI occurred concomitantly to the explosion of the sovereign debt crisis in Europe and the general economic downturn in many countries of the European Union (EU). This paper asks whether the European crisis contributed to the surge of Chinese FDI in Europe. In particular, did this surge occur as a result of an explicit strategy formulated by governments in EU Member States in order to dig their countries out of the crisis? The main argument is that the crisis has provided Chinese investors with two types of bargains: economic bargains due to depressed prices and a greater number of assets for sale, and political bargains due to the lessened political resistance to deals that may have been objectionable in flusher times. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","BIT; China; EU; European crisis; FDI; investment","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84898007968"

We examine whether economic diversity benefits regional economies in typical circumstances and in recovery after a natural disaster, using the case of the 1993 U.S. Midwest flood. By matching counties in the nine states affected by the flood to control counties, we isolate the influence of diversity on employment and income in normal circumstances and after a substantial shock. We found economic diversity to have mixed associations with employment and income in typical circumstances. On average, economically diverse counties tended to experience faster employment gains but slower growth in per capita income than less diverse areas. The effect of economic diversity upon resilience following a natural disaster was unambiguous. Economic diversity aided counties in weathering the downturn following the flood and sped their return to long-term patterns of employment and income growth. Takeaway for practice: In promoting policies to enhance economic diversity, planners in communities located in areas prone to natural disasters should consider both the goal of disaster resilience and the potential tradeoffs between different aspects of economic performance.

Nurses, being the largest professional group in healthcare, are strongly affected by cost reductions. Economic downturns destabilize the nursing labour market with potential negative outcomes, including serious shortages, extending beyond the recessionary period. The objectives of this manuscript are to provide an overview of the potential short- and long-run impact of economic downturns on the supply and demand of nurses, and present healthcare decision makers with a framework to enhance their ability to strategically manage their human resources through economic cycles.A narrative review of the literature on the effects of economic downturns on the nursing labour market in developed countries was carried out with a special focus on studies offering a longitudinal examination of labour force trends. Analysis indicates that economic downturns limit the ability of public payers and institutions to finance their existing health workforce. As salaried healthcare workers, nurses are especially susceptible to institutional budget cuts. In the short run, economic downturns may temporarily reduce the demand for and increase the supply of nurses, thereby influencing nursing wages and turnover rates. These effects may destabilise the nursing labour market in the long run. After economic downturns, the market would quickly display the pre-recessionary trends and there may be serious demand-supply imbalances resulting in severe shortages. Potential long-term effects of recession on the nursing labour market may include a downsized active workforce, difficulty in retaining younger nurses, a decreased supply of nurses and workforce casualisation.Lack of understanding of labour market dynamics and trends might mislead policy makers into making misinformed workforce downsizing decisions that are often difficult and expensive to reverse. In the aftermath of an economic downturn, the costs of attracting nurses back often outweigh the short term cost savings. Effective management should support the nursing workforce by creating attractive and stable work environments to retain nurses at a manageable cost. © 2012 Alameddine et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Demand; Economic downturn; Nurses; Policy; Recession; Supply","","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84865060151"

This article draws on an analysis of panel data from the Kauffman Firm Survey to investigate how the Great Recession affected the gender gap in entrepreneurial access to financing, net of individual and firm-level characteristics. Consistent with predictions, we find that women-led firms were significantly more likely than men-led firms to encounter difficulty in acquiring funding when small-business lending contracted in 2009 and 2010. We assess the consistency of our results with two different theories of bias or discrimination. Our findings shed light on mechanisms that may contribute to disadvantages for women entrepreneurs and, more broadly, highlight how the effects of ascribed status characteristics (e.g., gender) on economic decision-making may vary systematically with macroeconomic conditions. © 2016 The Author(s).","Discrimination; Entrepreneurship; Gender; Recession; Status","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84988458678"

Design/methodology/approach - A literature review is used to establish perceived local government procurement best practice. Secondary research is then drawn upon to establish local government procurement's response to the current economic recession. The paper is set within the context of English local government. The paper's contribution is in highlighting that perceived best public procurement practice may well, in the short-term, be inappropriate and perhaps delay economic recovery. Suggestions for more radical short-term procurement strategic interventions are set out and justified as accelerating the economic recovery. The suggestions are considered appropriate, not only for the current crisis, but also for future economic downturns or indeed any country facing such a situation. Findings - The analysis suggests that English local government procurement strategy generally remains unaltered from that adopted prior to the economic recession. It is then argued that current best practice may well hinder an economic recovery and a short-term shift in procurement strategy is required. Research limitations/implications - The economic recession is a current phenomenon and the secondary research could well suffer from self- selection bias, nevertheless the review of current policy documents suggests that a short-term shift in procurement strategy is justified. Practical implications - The paper identifies the weaknesses in current procurement strategy prior to setting out a short-term alternative procurement strategy that could help public procurement managers accelerate a viable economic recovery. Originality/value - The current global economic downturn represents a major challenge to public sector organisations, yet there remains an assumption that English local government procurement strategy developed during a period of economic boom, is appropriate during the recession.

Design/methodology/approach: Using an extensive micro-level data set of personal and job-related attributes containing all unemployed individuals in the Portuguese tourism and hospitality industry, a logit model with 56,142 observations is estimated to assess how each characteristic contributed to the unemployment odds during the COVID-19 crisis (until the end-July 2020), relatively to the pre-COVID period. Findings: The most vulnerable workers to COVID-19 unemployment seem to be older, less educated, less qualified, women and residents in regions with a higher concentration of people and tourism activity. Moreover, the COVID-19 crisis is generating a new type of unemployment by also affecting those who were never unemployed before, with more stable jobs and more motivated at work, while reducing voluntary disruptions. Practical implications: Public effort should be made not only to increase workforce education but especially to reinforce job-specific skills. The COVID-19 crisis has broken traditional protective measures against unemployment and separated workers from their desired occupations, which justifies new and exceptional job preservation measures. Policy recommendations are given aiming at strengthening worker resilience and industry competitiveness in the most affected sub-sectors and regions. Originality/value: This study extends the current understanding of worker vulnerability to economic downturns. Herein, this paper used a three-level approach (combining socio-demographic, work-related and regional factors), capturing the immediate effects of the COVID-19 crisis and focussing on the tourism and hospitality industry (the hardest-hit sector worldwide). © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","COVID-19; Downturn effects; Hospitality; Job losses; Portugal; Tourism; Vulnerability","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85107754570"

Many food shelves strive to provide effective nutrition programs to serve their clients, even while they are faced with a scarcity of resources. Rigorous evaluation of the impact of such programming on dietary outcomes is therefore warranted. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a pilot cooking and nutrition education intervention among food shelf clients. A 6-session class was conducted with 63 participants in 4 food shelves in Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota. Diet was assessed through a 24-hour recall from which a Healthy Eating Index (HEI-2010) score was created. Cooking skills were assessed by survey. Average HEI-2010 scores increased from 50.9 at baseline to 58.5 postintervention (P =.01, n = 43). Participants demonstrated improved cooking skills scores postintervention (35.9 vs 33.1 at baseline, P =.002, n = 45). Future research is needed to advance our understanding of how best to improve client nutrition knowledge and cooking skills.

Claims are made that the supply of scientists (including engineers and mathematicians) is crucial to the economy and the health of the nation, and a large number of initiatives have been funded to address the problem. We consider these claims in light of a re-analysis of existing figures from 1986 to 2009, for young scientists passing through education and into employment. Science graduates are heavily stratified by social origin, and this sorting takes place during initial schooling just as it does with other 'prestige' subjects. The majority of science graduates then move into initial occupations that are not directly related to their degree, suggesting that at this stage of life at least, the demand for scientists trained in specific areas is more than met by existing numbers. We have no reason to believe that the situation is different to other vocational and non-vocational subjects, so perhaps science is not as special as politicians and business leaders imagine. Perhaps young people are put off careers in science by their education. Or perhaps the incentives are not right, leading to the 'wrong' kinds of students in science, and so wastage and inefficiency in the supply process. More pertinently, perhaps this vocational outcome is not how a developed country should assess the value and importance of scientific knowledge among its population. © 2011 Copyright 2011 Society for Educational Studies.","participation; policy; science education","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84865827032"

Objective: This study used extensive Swedish registry data to investigate the link between psychiatric conditions diagnosed during military conscription and unemployment over two decades. Further, we identified whether this relation was amplified during an economic downturn and tested whether it was affected by adjustment for unobserved family characteristics using sibling fixed-effects models. Method: Psychiatric conditions were diagnosed by psychologists and psychiatrists at military conscription in sample of 929,191 Swedish men (mean age = 18.4 years) between 1969 and 1989. The average number of days unemployed per year was observed from 1992 to 2012, using the records of the Swedish Public Employment Services. Results: After adjustment for physical health and childhood socioeconomic status those diagnosed with any psychiatric condition experienced approximately an additional 10 days per year unemployment compared to others. Alcohol (16 days unemployment) and other substance use disorders (17 days) were the strongest predictors of exposure to future unemployment, followed by personality disorders (10 days), neurotic and adjustment conditions (nine days), and depressive disorders (six days). Family background factors accounted for approximately half of the observed relationship between mental health conditions and unemployment. Psychiatric conditions interacted with macroeconomic conditions such that those with pre-existing alcohol-related, and neurotic and adjustment disorders were disproportionately more likely to become unemployed following the 1990s crisis in Sweden. Conclusions: Adolescent mental health conditions forecast an elevated risk of unemployment, which endures over the life course and is amplified in times of economic uncertainty. Investment in youth mental health services and alcohol and substance use prevention programs may yield economic benefits by reducing unemployment. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Mental health; Psychiatric conditions; Recession; Sibling comparisons; Siblings fixed-effects; Unemployment","Adolescent; Adolescent Health; Adult; Economic Recession; Humans; Male; Mental Disorders; Mental Health; Siblings; Socioeconomic Factors; Substance-Related Disorders; Sweden; Unemployment; Young Adult; Sweden; adolescence; health services; labor market; mental health; population dynamics; prediction; sibling; unemployment; adjustment disorder; adolescence; adolescent; adult; alcoholism; Article; controlled study; depression; drug dependence; human; lifespan; male; mental health; neurosis; personality disorder; population research; social status; Sweden; unemployment; adolescent health; drug dependence; economic recession; mental disease; mental health; sibling; socioeconomics; unemployment; young adult","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85060233979"

We explore this puzzle by distinguishing public acceptance of austerity as a general approach and support for specific austerity packages. Using original survey data from five European countries, we show that austerity is in fact the preferred response among most voters. We develop potential explanations for this surprising preference and demonstrate the empirical limitations of accounts centered on economic interests or an intuitive framing advantage. Instead, we show that the preference for austerity is highly sensitive to its political backers and precise composition of spending cuts and tax hikes. Using a novel approach to estimate support for historical austerity programs, we contend that governments' strategic crafting of policy packages is a key factor underlying the support for austerity.  © ","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85101875076"

These gazelle firms experienced internal stress - often positive stress or eustress - parallel to macroeconomic shocks, and these internal stresses were largely independent of external factors. Staw, Sandelands and Dutton's heavily cited threat-rigidity theory ('Threat rigidity effects in organizational behavior: a multilevel analysis', Administrative Science Quarterly, 26, pp. 501-552, 1981) suggests that, when exposed to threat, either internal or external, decision-makers respond conservatively, adhering to previously learned solutions rather than responding innovatively. This study examines five young gazelle firms, established just prior to the economic downturn. It explores management responses to internal and external threats and suggests that rigidity plays a role as an independent variable as well as a consequence of crisis. Drawing on the literature on resilience of individuals in the face of trauma, the study finds that autistic managerial response in approaches to performance management in emerging firms during a crisis is likely to produce additional stress.

Some modes of tourism, globally, due to the economic downturn, have slowed down, but the tourism sector itself has done remarkably well during the last two-three years by offering the new model i.e. facility generally called Wellness. Within tourism, wellness is relatively a new trend that has registered an impressive growth rate. World-wide more and more people are traveling to destinations that provide wellness facilities. The rise of 'wellness' concept can be attributed to two factors. First, the WHO has now long been pushing forward an integrated concept of «wellbeing» and «fitness» into its global health policy. Second, the overall education of people has increased the human awareness of personal health. Tourism service providers, especially the luxury hotels were quick to cash upon these facts and created a palette of wellness services such as spa and health treatments, occupational health therapy, beauty treatments, sports' facilities, spiritual activities, massages, and rehabilitation programs, etc. Since sufficient data on the subject have not yet emerged, the paper basically discusses some conceptual aspects of wellness tourism only.","Happiness; Meditation; Recreation; Therapy; Welfare; Well-being","financial crisis; global economy; growth rate; health policy; mental health; psychology; public health; sports facility; tourism development; tourism economics; tourism market; tourist destination; welfare economics; welfare provision; World Health Organization","Review","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84865135347"

However, because the current COVID-19 pandemic has both of these elements, it is unclear how helping may be impacted. Economic crisis research suggests that such events are associated with less helping, whereas disaster research suggests that such events are associated with greater helping. We pair the event system theory (Morgeson, F. P., Mitchell, T. R., & Liu, D. (2015). Event system theory: An event-oriented approach to the organizational sciences. Academy of Management Review, 40(4), 515-537) with these two logics (economic downturn and disaster) to suggest that health and economic threats within the COVID-19 pandemic operate with potentially opposing forces on helping-related outcomes. To test these ideas at a macro-level, we examined internet search volume for recession, COVID-19, and interest in helping. At a micro-level, we examined the relationships between work- hour insecurity and perceived job-related COVID-19 risk—two salient COVID-19-related economic and health threats—and helping customers and coworkers. Consistent with economic crisis logic, macro-level concern about recession was negatively associated with interest in helping. Moreover, at the individual level, work-hour insecurity negatively predicted helping coworkers. Consistent with disaster logic, at the individual level, perceived job-related COVID-19 threat was positively associated with helping coworkers and negatively associated with helping customers. These findings suggest that the specific feature of the COVID-19 event system (economic versus health) and the target (organizational insiders versus outsiders) matter for shaping helping behavior. These findings have implications for helping during crises that involve economic and/or disaster elements. © The Author(s) 2020.","COVID-19; Google Trends; helping; recession; work-hour insecurity","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85093940425"

It proposes to do this by examining one key CSR initiative, namely, the United Nations Global Compact (GC). Design/methodology/approach: A two-part empirical investigation was conducted on a sample of GC participants (US signatories). The first method comprises a comprehensive survey completed mainly by company CEOs. The second approach involves content analysis of CEO statements (extracted from CSR reports - fiscal years 2007-2009), which describe new strategies for managing under challenging economic and financial times. Findings: It was found that the CSR efforts of participants of the GC that have integrated their CSR into their policies, programs, performance, and goals, and those with lesser conformity with the active principles of the GC will be affected more by the economic crisis. The paper also reports on the challenges, opportunities, and new strategies for managing during the downturn. Research limitations/implications: While the study focuses on a relatively small sample of CSR-driven organizations, it is shared with a framework that investigates CSR initiatives in distress and suggest anchors for future research. Originality/value: To the best of one's knowledge, this research is the first effort to understand the implications of the current economic crisis on the CSR initiatives of GC participants in the USA. In addition to investigating the practical concerns of managers in times of crisis, our research questions the role of the initiative itself in dealing with these concerns. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Citizenship; Corporate governance; Economic depression; Social responsibility","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-77956154226"

Two initial studies revealed that (a) lay beliefs were that materialism declines with age and (b) previous research findings also implied a modest, negative relationship between age and materialism. Yet, previous research has considered age only as a linear control variable, thereby precluding the possibility of more intricate relationships between age and materialism. Moreover, prior studies have relied on cross-sectional data and thus confound age and cohort effects. To improve on this, the main study used longitudinal data from 8 waves spanning 9 years of over 4,200 individuals (16 to 90 years) to examine age effects on materialism while controlling for cohort and period effects. Using a multivariate multilevel latent growth model, it found that materialism followed a curvilinear trajectory across the life span, with the lowest levels at middle age and higher levels before and after that. Thus, in contrast to lay beliefs, materialism increased in older age. Moreover, age effects on materialism differed markedly between 3 core themes of materialism: acquisition centrality, possession-defined success, and acquisition as the pursuit of happiness. In particular, acquisition centrality and possession-defined success were higher at younger and older age.

The region was characterised by a historical dependence on copper mining and associated industries which experienced a severe economic downturn from the late 1980s. In this context, urban agriculture has become a key livelihood strategy and a means to assure food security.

This article examines the impact of system dissatisfaction and fundamental cultural values on democratic legitimacy, using logistic regression analyses of data drawn from an electoral survey in 2000. It is found that widespread public dissatisfaction with the economic downturn has not been generalized to the abstract, structural level of regime legitimacy. Equally widespread discontent with the political situation matters; but it has strengthened public support for democracy, rather than weakened it. Finally, democratic legitimacy is grounded in liberal, post-material and individualist-competitive values. In recognition of the plausible durability of these fundamental cultural norms and in view of the relative lack of support for non-democratic alternatives and strong support for partial electoral reform, we conclude that Hong Kong is very likely to remain on track toward a fuller democracy by incremental steps.","","China; Hong Kong; democracy; electoral system; political system; self government","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0036893985"

In pursuing a historical perspective, four stages are discerned: the pre-welfare state of the late nineteenth century; the advanced welfare state climaxing in the 1970s; the neo-liberal policy phase since the early 1980s; and the recent phase since the mid-2000s. It is argued that, during each phase, the prevalent organizational form of service provision (whether municipal/public, private, or third sector) was shaped by the current dominant political beliefs and discourse; that is, by the “social democratic” assumption of the operational preference of public/municipal sector provision until the 1970s and the neo-liberal trust in the operational superiority of market liberalization and privatization. In the recent phase since the mid-2000s, divergent trends are observed. On the one hand, the neo-liberal market and privatization drive has persisted while, on the other, in reaction to the downturn of the neo-liberal policy tenets and the socio-economic fallout of fiscal austerity policies, a comeback of the public/municipal sector (remunicipalization) in public service provision and a (re-)emergence of third sector organizations and actors in the provision of personal social services and care have taken shape, somewhat reminiscent of the pre-welfare state engagement of societal actors. © 2018, Published with license by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. © 2018, © Hellmut Wollmann.","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85050207304"

Because the pandemic continues to evolve, this study aimed to better understand its impact and propose a roadmap to support the survival and recovery of construction organizations through a two-stage research design. The first stage of this study built upon the economic contagion literature to empirically examine the magnitude and severity of the impacts of the pandemic on construction organizations globally. A joint contagion model, the crisis severity index, and Student t-tests were used to analyze the longitudinal daily stock prices and indices collected from 80 construction organizations and the Chinese and US stock markets, spanning both the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 periods (i.e., a total of 840 observations). The results showed the extent of the impact of the pandemic within the construction industry and its varying severity levels over time across regions in a pattern that is consistent with the spread of the pandemic itself. These findings urgently call for construction organizations to plan their response strategies for short-term and long-term performance. Accordingly, a systematic literature review was conducted in the second stage of this study to synthesize the best practices undertaken by construction organizations in the face of historical economic downturns. Specifically, the theoretical lenses of dynamic capabilities and organizational resilience were applied to synthesize the literature to develop an evidence-based roadmap. Construction organizations can use this roadmap to systematically scan their environments for threats or opportunities (i.e., sensing), formulate suitable responsive strategies (i.e., seizing), and build their resilience over time (i.e., reconfiguration). These insights can help them to survive, recover, and even thrive in the face of the pandemic and build resilience in the anticipation of future disturbances. © 2022 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Construction organizations; COVID-19; Dynamic capabilities; Economic crisis; Organizational resilience; Recovery strategies","Enterprise resource management; Financial markets; Recovery; Seizing; Construction organizations; COVID-19; Dynamic capability perspective; Dynamics capability; Economic crisis; Organisational; Organizational resilience; Recovery strategies; Research designs; Roadmap; Construction industry","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85122978199"

We employ an original bank-level data set that splits bank credit portfolios in 21 granular categories, covering household and corporate loans. The results corroborate the presence of a strong procyclical behavior of credit quality, and show a robust negative relationship between the logistic transformation of non-performing loans (NPLs) and GDP growth, with a lag response of up to three quarters. The results also indicate that the procyclical behavior of loan quality varies across credit types. This is novel in the literature and suggests that banks with larger exposures to highly procyclical credit types and economic sectors would tend to undergo sharper deterioration in the quality of their credit portfolios during an economic downturn. Lack of sufficient portfolio granularity in macro stress testing fails to capture these effects and thus introduces a source of bias that tends to underestimate the tail losses stemming from the riskier banks in a system. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Banking system; Credit risk; Financial crisis; Stress tests","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84859708256"

Using a method based upon conditional probabilities of high and low growth rates, tests are employed to detect β-convergence in UK regional house prices. Importantly, given the suggested differences in regional house price dynamics over the course of the cycle in the housing market, β-convergence is considered not only over the full sample of observations available, but over cyclical sub-samples also. Interestingly, while convergence is not detected over the whole sample available, it is observed over the housing market cycle, with overwhelming evidence of convergence detected particularly during the downturn. These findings, supported by results for σ-convergence, show that failure to detect convergence may be due to its episodic nature being masked when arbitrarily defined sample periods are considered. © 2011 Urban Studies Journal Limited.","","United Kingdom; United Kingdom; convergence; episodic event; housing market; sampling; stochasticity; urban economy; convergence; economic growth; housing market; price dynamics; regional development; stochasticity","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84055178966"

The selection of key suppliers and how relationships with these suppliers are managed and incentivized can dramatically affect the buying company's performance. While the extant literature focusing on industrial buyer-supplier relationships is significant, the severe economic downturn beginning in 2008 tested buyer-supplier relationships in unprecedented ways, yielding new insights. The research presented in this paper uses dyadic cases to investigate transformations within industrial relationships during the economic downturn. Propositions are formulated that focus on why and how firms responded to the downturn. Three primary types of relationships are identified. The results indicate variation in the ways buying companies managed their key supplier relationships during the downturn: some firms behaved more cooperatively and found ways to jointly confront the effects of the downturn, while others responded by behaving competitively to maximize their individual outcomes. The results further suggest that researchers need to revisit existing models of relationship development and dissolution to understand how these relationships evolve or devolve.

This dependence between oil and agricultural commodities motivates an analysis of interdependence and spillover influence in extreme oil market scenarios. By means of an extreme quantile approach, this study models the return distribution of oil in relation to some of the most traded agricultural and precious metal commodities. We find that extreme lower quantiles of oil returns have a positive effect on the lower quantiles of gold, silver, and rice returns. These effects are more significant using daily-frequency data, while for weekly and monthly frequencies, the effect is less significant. The decrease in oil returns during a bearish oil market will cause a decrease in precious metal and rice returns; therefore, these cannot be used to hedge the downside risk of oil investments, especially in the short term. These commodities might only serve as a diversification strategy for oil investments. The lower quantiles of oil returns have either no effect, or a negative effect, on the lower quantiles of wheat and corn, making them suitable hedges for extreme downturns in oil prices. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Agricultural commodities; Energy market oil prices; Extreme quantile dependence; Precious metals; Predictability","Triticum aestivum; Zea mays; Agriculture; Commerce; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Economic geology; Gold; Investments; Petroleum transportation; Precious metals; Silver; Wooden fences; Agricultural commodities; Diversification strategies; Effectiveness measure; Extreme quantiles; Global economics; Oil Prices; Predictability; Price fluctuation; agricultural production; commodity market; commodity price; economic instability; energy market; oil industry; precious metal; prediction; trend analysis; Financial markets","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85057198419"

This paper describes a dynamic model that exhibits both delay and cycles and develops methods for analysing the role of delay in propogating business cycles. A number of interesting characteristics of the cycle are revealed. First, the effect of delay is asymmetric: it lengthens the recovery but not the downturn. Second, delay can increase the amplitude and typically reduces the frequency of the cycle.

Design/methodology/approach - Data are collected via self-report web-based surveys in California, Tuscany and Catalonia in 2010-2011 during a severe economic downturn in the wine industry. Findings - Of the 260 respondents among the three country samples, over 75 per cent are family-owned and family-managed. Respondents indicate who has implemented a clear business case for an Environmental Management System (EMS) and who has not. Benefits and challenges of implementing sustainability practices are also addressed. Practical implications - A comparable percentage of respondents across the three countries indicated a ""clear business case for EMS"". Wineries in all three countries perceive that they have competitive advantage through implementation of EMS and commitment to sustainable practices. Top perceived benefits for respondents from the USA and Italy are focused on cost reduction strategies, while top perceived benefits for Spanish respondents are focused on differentiation strategies. Originality/value - Activities that create competitive advantages for wine businesses in different countries are understudied; this research bridges that gap. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Environment; Italy; Spain; Survey research; Surveys; USA; Wines","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84937912860"

The source of this capital flight is the 'medicine' (the Fund programme), not the 'disease' (the economic downturn necessitating the IMF programme). I argue that austerity deters portfolio inflows through its effects on future returns.

Trump took office in the White House, but the most significant event is the outbreak of the China-US trade war, whose unprecedented scale and impact has drawn wide attention in China and sparked considerable debate. This article aims to review the four main stages of this great debate on the China-US trade war among China's influential intellectuals and prominent thinkers. It covers the three-year period since beginning of the Trump administration. The initial argument among Chinese academics was whether or not there could ever be a trade war, which led to a dividing line between optimists and pessimists. Soon after, when China-US relations took a sharp downturn and a trade war seemed inevitable, Chinese scholars shifted their focus to reasons why the United States should wage a trade war against China. This culminated in three different perspectives embodied respectively in the structural conflict theory, institutional conflict theory, and the theory on exporting domestic problems. After China and the United States began slapping additional tariffs on one another's exported goods, and with the flare-up of the Zhongxing Telecommunication Equipment Corporation (ZTE) and Huawei incidents, the debate on how to respond to a trade war cleaved between the 'whole nation system school' and the 'market reform school'. As to coping with the technology war, Chinese intellectuals were divided between the paths of 'independent innovation' and 'open innovation'. More recently, in view of the many signs that the China-US trade war could continue indefinitely, and an economic decoupling of the two nations is no longer unimaginable, a fierce debate has arisen between those that advocate full preparations for such economic decoupling and those who insist on further links with the US economy. Although the main themes of the four stages of the debate differ somewhat, they share a certain degree of consistency as regards the conceptual pedigree of the debating parties. Their divergence derives, in essence, from different perspectives on such issues as state power versus market force, independence versus interdependence, and zero-sum competition of power versus win-win economic cooperation. This also exemplifies the competing views in Chinese academia on classical political economy. © 2019 The Author(s).

We consider a manufacturer that sells through two distributors. If a customer finds that his distributor is out of stock, then he will sometimes seek to make a purchase from the other distributor; if the latter is also out of stock, the customer will order from both distributors. When his order is filled by one of the distributors, the customer cancels any duplicate orders. Furthermore, the customer cancels all of his outstanding orders after a random period of time. Assuming that the manufacturer is unaware of duplicate orders, we prove that she will overestimate both the demand rate and the cancellation rate. Surprisingly, failure to account for duplicate orders can cause short-term underinvestment in capacity. However, in long-term equilibrium under stable demand conditions the manufacturer overinvests in capacity. Our results suggest that Cisco's write-off was caused by estimation errors and cannot be blamed entirely on the economic downturn. Finally, we provide some guidance on estimation in the presence of double orders. © 2005 INFORMS.","Distribution channels; Duplicate ordering; Maximum-likelihood estimation; Queueing systems; Reneging","Customer satisfaction; Error analysis; Inventory control; Maximum likelihood estimation; Distribution channels; Duplicate ordering; Queuing systems; Rengaging; Sales","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-27544504473"

In this context, the particular study investigates the link between two indices of cognitive social capital; namely interpersonal and institutional trust, and the presence of major depression and generalized anxiety disorder. A random and representative sample of 2256 respondents took part in a cross-sectional nationwide telephone survey the time period February-April 2011 (Response Rate=80.5%), after being recruited from the national phone number databank. Major depression and generalized anxiety disorder were assessed with the Structured Clinical Interview, while for interpersonal and institutional trust the pertinent questions of the European Social Survey were utilized. Socio-demographic variables were also encompassed in the research instrument, while participants' degree of financial strain was assessed through the Index of Personal Economic Distress. Both interpersonal and institutional trust were found to constitute protective factors against the presence of major depression, but not against generalized anxiety disorder for people experiencing low economic hardship. Nonetheless, in people experiencing high financial strain, interpersonal and institutional trust were not found to bear any association with the presence of the two disorders. Consistent with these, the present study shows that the effect of social capital on mental health is not uniform, as evident by the different pattern of results for the two disorders. Furthermore, cognitive social capital no longer exerts its protective influence on mental health if individuals experience high economic distress. As a corollary of this, interventions aiming at mitigating the mental health effects of economic downturns cannot rely solely on the enhancement of social capital, but also on alleviating economic burden. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Economic crisis; Financial hardship; Generalized anxiety disorder; Major depression; Social capital; Trust","Adult; Aged; Anxiety Disorders; Community-Institutional Relations; Depressive Disorder, Major; Economic Recession; Female; Greece; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Interview, Psychological; Male; Middle Aged; Social Support; Trust; Young Adult; Greece; Economic crisis; Financial hardship; Generalized anxiety disorder; Major depression; Social capital; Trust; economic instability; financial crisis; mental health; social capital; adult; aged; article; correlation analysis; cross-sectional study; demography; disease association; economic recession; female; financial deficit; generalized anxiety disorder; Greece; human; major depression; male; middle aged; social capital; socioeconomics; telephone interview; trust; young adult","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84892495030"

The discussion, however, recognises the challenges presented by the global economic downturn as well as the recessionary measures that Dubai may have to pursue in order to encourage people to travel to the destination in significant numbers. It is proposed that Dubai may have to look to wider market segments beyond the traditional luxury travel market, particularly through the development of budget hotels. This could challenge any productive notion of a socially sustainable tourism environment and intensify prevailing social concerns. The paper then moves onto a detailed discussion concerning the social impacts of tourism development in Dubai. The discussion focuses on ethnic distinctions in migrant housing and geographical location, social ramifications relating to the urbanisation and aestheticisation of space, and limitations in the availability of cultural tourism resources and heritage infrastructure. Finally, constraints are identified in terms of mobilising local employment resources and human capital to serve the tourism and hospitality industry, and with respect to prevailing social issues concerning expatriate employment. © 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

However, the gap between SOEs and non-SOEs can be explained by just two factors: SOEs face higher circulation tax rates than non-SOEs, and have a higher capital intensity. In as fas as these are the result of government policies and historical factors discriminating againts SOEs, privatization of SOEs may improve these enterprises' profitability levels, but privatizations is not a necessary condition.

Method: Data were from the 2010 National Alcohol Survey (N = 5,382). Surveys assessed both severe losses (i.e., job and housing loss) and moderate losses (i.e., reduced hours/pay and trouble paying the rent/mortgage) attributed to the 2008-2009 recession. Alcohol outcomes included total annual volume, monthly drunkenness, drinking consequences, and alcohol dependence (based on criteria from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition). Results: Compared with Whites, Blacks reported significantly greater exposure to job loss and trouble paying the rent/mortgage, and Latinos reported greater exposure to all economic losses. However, only Black-White differences were robust in multivariate analyses. Interaction tests suggested that associations between exposure to economic loss and alcohol problems were stronger among Blacks than Whites. Given severe (vs. no) loss, Blacks had about 13 times the odds of both two or more drinking consequences and alcohol dependence, whereas the corresponding odds ratios for Whites were less than 3. Conversely, associations between economic loss and alcohol outcomes were weak and ambiguous among Latinos. Conclusions: Results suggest greater exposure to economic loss for both Blacks and Latinos (vs. Whites) and that the Black population may be particularly vulnerable to the negative effects of economic hardship on the development and/or maintenance of alcohol problems. Findings extend the economic literature and signal policy makers and service providers that Blacks and Latinos may be at special risk during economic downturns.","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84870916440"

As the economy plunged into a recession, with more than 3 million Americans already having lost their homes as this chapter goes to press and millions more likely to do so (unless the government intervenes more successfully than it has), and as the government spends hundreds of billions in bailouts to prevent the economic recession from growing worse, there is a growing consensus: There was a need for more government regulation. Even the high priest of laissez faire economics, Alan Greenspan, has admitted that he may have gone too far in believing that markets could be self-regulating. Responding to these calls – as if to close the barn door after all the horses have gotten out – the Federal Reserve has tightened some regulations. If it is the case that better regulations could have prevented, or even mitigated, the downturn, the country, and the world, will be paying a heavy price for the failure to regulate adequately. And the social costs are no less grave – as hundreds of thousands of Americans will not only have lost their homes but also their lifetime savings. © Cambridge University Press and The Tobin Projec 2010.","","","Book chapter","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84932611446"

Countercyclical remittances moderate the decline of households’ consumption during recessions. These remittances also are used to finance the start-up costs of microenterprises that bolster households’ income during economic downturns. We show that the positive income effect from countercyclical remittances also leads to a decrease in salaried labor supply, which generates offsetting upward pressure on wages during recessions and adversely affects the recovery of the economy. Consistent with the microeconomic evidence, the behavior of remittances decisively affects labor force participation and the composition of employment between non-salaried and salaried employment over the business cycle. The model delivers labor market and aggregate cyclical dynamics that are consistent with the Mexican data, including a highly volatile and countercyclical unemployment rate. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Business cycles; Microenterprise development; Remittances; Search and matching frictions; Self-employment; Unemployment","Mexico [North America]; business cycle; economic conditions; entrepreneur; microenterprise; remittance; self employment; unemployment","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84992372663"

Based on life-history interviews and classroom observations, I argue that these learners' second language and literacy development can only be understood within the larger sociopolitical context over time. To this end, I draw on participants' life-history narratives to situate their experiences of studying English within the larger social history of immigration in California and within the intergenerational trajectories of education in their families. Specifically, these narratives illustrate participants' perspectives on how their language learning opportunities have been mediated by such factors as their parents' messages about education, their previous experiences of schooling, U.S. immigration policies, the 2001 economic downturn, and the availability of bilingual education for their children. I conclude by arguing that to meet the diverse needs and goals of learners in their classrooms, ESL educators need to incorporate into the curriculum the specific sociocontextual issues that these learners confront in their daily lives.","","","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-29244470359"

The ripple effects of these disturbances are being felt beyond Indonesia's shores, especially in neighbouring states, which are only just emerging from the shock of the worst economic recession in Southeast Asia's modern history. For the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Indonesia's current travails could not have come at a worse time. Chastised by Western critics for having done little to mitigate the effects of the prolonged economic downturn, ASEAN's response to the East Timor crisis is seen, by critics and supporters alike, as a major test of the organisation's ability to ameliorate and manage regional conflicts. This article examines the underlying political and strategic concerns that are driving ASEAN's approach to East Timor. Although wary of alienating Indonesia and of being drawn into the East Timor imbroglio, ASEAN has nevertheless demonstrated a preparedness to play a significant political and military role in regional conflict management. ASEAN's willingness to invest in East Timor and to accept East Timor as a member state will be an even more crucial test of the organisation's efficacy and relevance. Without sustained economic support from Southeast Asia, it will be difficult for East Timor to survive and prosper. A weak, isolated East Timor could easily become an island of instability in an already troubled sea.","","East Timor; ASEAN; conflict management; independence; international relations","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0033884296"

This research was stimulated by the overrepresentation of UK students in the Erasmus work placement programme since its introduction in 2007. Using a multi-methods approach, based on student interviews and report analysis, five main drivers to Erasmus work placement mobility are revealed: employability, the economic downturn and subsequent failure to secure a placement in the UK, language, finance and personal factors. This paper discusses these five factors to reveal the complex and interlinked influences that encourage UK students to undertake an Erasmus work placement. Overall, employability is identified as the main driver to the mobility of Erasmus work placement students. It is argued that the neoliberal agenda in UK higher education, to streamline away from education for the public good, towards education for employability purposes, is a key factor in explaining the popularity of Erasmus work placements in the UK. Importantly, this paper argues that the drivers to work placement mobility are different to the motivations to study abroad. It is, therefore, essential that they are dealt with separately in order to explore the differences and similarities between sub-types of student mobility. © 2013 © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","employability; Erasmus; neoliberalisation; student mobility; UK students; work placements","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84893638319"

Some suggest that events surrounding Vietnam and Watergate transformed the professional norms of journalism. However, the trend could also be a more superficial and transi- tory response to other circumstantial factors that converged in the same time period, such as president-level characteristics (the prevalence of Republicans, Washington out- siders, and more vigorous news management efforts), the political environment (the rise of official discord), and the economic environment (a downturn in the business cycle). This study disentangles these various factors and assesses their relative success in explaining trends in journalistic conduct in the postwar era. Data are drawn from a large sample of presidential news conferences from 1953 through 2000, focusing on the aggressiveness of journalists' questions. The results strongly support the normative shift hypothesis, although economic factors have also been consequential. These results suggest a punctuated equilibrium model of journalistic change in relations between the White House press corps and the presidency. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Aggressive journalism; Presidential news conferences; Presidential press conferences; Watchdog journalism; White House press corps","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-77955407528"

Based on the findings, it proposes some policy measures for improved governance practices to protect banks from future financial crisis or economic downturns. Design/methodology/approach: The study comprises data from the largest publicly traded Russian banks listed on the Russian Stock Exchange RST for the period. Operating performance data were collected from financial statements, while corporate governance mechanisms were collected from annual reports available on the banks’ websites. Because panel data were used, the panel regression model was used to control unobserved time-constant heterogeneity. Findings: The findings revealed a positive impact of corporate governance on bank performance before and after the financial crisis. The financial crisis enforced Russian banks to improve their corporate governance practices, resulting in better operating performance after the crisis. Surprisingly, the results for the during-crisis period show that better governance did not yield higher operating performance in Russian banks. Originality/value: This is one of the first studies to provide empirical results regarding the relationship between corporate governance practices and bank performance in Russia across different financial crisis periods. The findings revealed the uniqueness of corporate governance scenarios of Russia which could provide important guidelines for other transition economies and emerging markets. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Bank performance; Board characteristics; Corporate disclosure; Corporate governance; Ownership structures; Russia","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84990248953"

Drawing on the political settlement approach, it explores how the distribution of power both within and outside the ruling elite is structured and consequently how the underlying political processes have been shaped by the expectations of natural resource windfalls. The article argues that the present socio-economic crisis in Mozambique is not due to national resource assets in themselves. Instead, the political and economic downturn in Mozambique should be understood as a manifestation of how the political settlement has been organized and rent mobilization controlled by the ruling elite. To understand how the prospect of rents from natural resource sectors have influenced the political settlement, we have argued that one has to look at the dynamics of power both within and outside the ruling elite and the incentives they create for elites to use the control of power and access to economic benefits to achieve narrow and short-term gains rather than inclusive and longer-term goals. © The Author(s) 2018.

This effect of policy uncertainty is of a similar magnitude for all firms across all regions and sectors, albeit with a few exceptions. As expected, well-capitalized financial firms are less affected. Our findings have important implications for policymakers and politicians, since if their response during a severe market decline is not timely and decisive, the delay will come at a cost.

Design/methodology/approach - Data collected for this study included customer complaints on flight problems, ticketing, refunds, fares, customer service, advertising, and other problems, overall carrier on-time performance, involuntary denied boardings, and mishandled baggage. Total yearly departures by carrier were obtained from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics and used to normalize the service data. Service quality rates were calculated for the industry overall and by individual carrier. The total quality rate represents the sum of the following data: the percentage of late flights, total number of consumer complaints, total number of involuntary denied boardings, and total number of mishandled baggage reports divided by total yearly departures for a particular airline. In a real sense, this rate is a measure of disquality and can be interpreted as the number of quality problems per departure. Findings - The data show that during periods of retrenchment when airlines are reducing flight schedules due to economic downturns the level of on-time arrival tends to improve while customer complaints, denied boardings, and mishandled baggage decline. Part of the explanation for the changes is the lack of airport and air traffic capacity to handle periods of higher traffic volume. Originality/value - As a critical component of the transportation system, the ability of the airline industry to provide reliable, timely service is important. Understanding the factors that contribute to service problems can help guide airline decisions about process and government decisions about infrastructure needs.","Airlines; Complaints; Customer satisfaction; Customer services quality; United States of America","","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-39049146964"

Data on voters' issue priorities from 2000 to 2011 shows that voters were more likely to consider the economy an important issue during periods of bad or volatile economic performance. A weak economy also focuses voter attention on corruption and crime while reducing attention to social policy and foreign affairs.

Beyond divides across populations, trends point to increasingly unequal housing-market dynamics across space. Nonetheless, little systematic evidence exists on the spatial inequality of housing values. In this paper we address this through a detailed investigation of house-value developments in the Netherlands over time and space. We draw on national registers including longitudinal and geocoded data for the entire housing stock over the 2006–2018 period. Spatial polarisation is examined across different scales at the national, provincial, and urban level. We further investigate how housing-market inequality trends vary over time, particularly between periods of economic boom and house-price increases or, conversely, periods of downturn. Our analyses expose a substantial and widespread trend of spatial polarisation. Rising spatial inequality between neighbourhoods is clearly apparent at the national level, within all but one province, as well as for 44 of the 50 largest municipalities. The polarising trend appears structural and pervasive. While boom periods saw the strongest increases, inequality levels, remarkably, remained stable or even saw continued increases over the period of declining house prices. These patterns of spatial polarisation in house values have fundamental societal implications towards uneven wealth accumulation and in amplifying socio-economic cleavages across populations and space.

However, one of the dimensions in which they differ is the presence and varieties of populism in parties’ political proposals. Drawing on holistic coding of party manifestos, we assess the varying presence of populist rhetoric in mainstream and challenger parties before and after the 2008 economic downturn. Our empirical findings show that populism is much higher in Greece compared to Spain and Portugal. We do not find a significant impact of the crisis as the degree of populism remains rather stable in Greece and Portugal, while it increases in Spain, mainly due to the rise of new populist forces. The study confirms that populist rhetoric is a strategy adopted mainly by challenger and ideologically radical parties. In addition, inclusionary populism is the predominant flavour of populist parties in new Southern Europe, although exclusionary populism is present to a lesser extent in the Greek case. We contend that the interaction between the national context–namely the ideological legacy of parties and the main dimensions of competition–and the strategic options of party leadership is crucial for explaining cross-country variation in the intensity of populism and the specific issues that characterise populist discourse. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","economic crisis; holistic grading; inclusionary populism; party manifesto; Populism; Southern Europe","Greece; Portugal; Spain; financial crisis; leadership; party politics; political discourse; populism","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85065068960"

The yield premium increases from 5 basis points for one-notch splits to 15 (20) basis points for two-notch (three-notch) splits. These findings indicate that investors demand higher yields for split rated bonds to compensate for the information opacity of such bonds. In addition, the yield premium for split rated bonds is higher during economic recessions, indicating investors are more risk averse during economic downturns. Consequently, split ratings impose higher borrowing costs for firms, especially during economic downturns. © 2010 Financial Management Association International.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-77956457536"

In view of the current crisis, we examine how the COVID-19 pandemic affected the European green bond market. Using daily data from Thomson Reuter's Refinitiv, we conducted event studies on corporate credit spread changes over the period from January 1 to December 31, 2020. Our results reveal that green bonds' credit spreads increased significantly after the start of the coronavirus outbreak. However, as the fear of the pandemic eased in response to positive news about the vaccines, green bonds' credit spreads fell below conventional bonds. Overall, green bonds showed a higher risk exposure and lower resilience to distress while profiting during an upside. Our paper provides the first evidence about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the announcement of vaccines' effectiveness on the European corporate green bond market.

The model is tested on 860 Swedish firms followed during an economic downturn. Results indicate that internationalization activities follow a bounded rational process characterized by search behavior which is triggered by performance feedback.

After a relatively modest downturn in the early 1980s, prices rose rapidly until the Asian financial crisis in 1997. Since then, and despite increased government efforts to stimulate the stagnant property market, prices have continued to fall and negative equity remains pervasive. Given the centrality of property investment and speculation historically for households, financial institutions and for wider government economic strategies, the state of the residential market remains of central political and policy concern. Against this background of Hong Kong's apparently declining economic fortunes and major shifts in housing policy, this paper explores aspects of wealth accumulation in the home-ownership sector. Linking to a well-established set of debates in the academic literature, the paper explores the impact of policy change and house price trajectories on different cohorts of households. For example, those cohorts who entered home-ownership in the late 1980s generally saw rapid increases in their property values fuelled by generous state-assisted home-ownership schemes and a buoyant economy. By contrast, those entering in the late 1990s have experienced a much less favourable policy and economic environment. The paper also explores the extent to which price trajectories have varied in different sectors. © 2004 The Editors of Urban Studies.","","Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East; Hong Kong; cohort analysis; homeowner; housing market; market conditions; price dynamics","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-5044250819"

To this end, it first introduces the various dimensions of wage, income, consumption and wealth inequality, and studies how they have developed. The analysis shows less wage dispersion in Spain than in other comparable economies, even after the crisis years, while the surge in unemployment during the period resulted in a high level of inequality in per capita income. The level of inequality in Spain is more moderate when total gross household income is analysed, decreasing during the crisis as a result of pensions developing more favourably than other sources of income, in conjunction with young people delaying setting up home. Inequality in per capita consumption rose during the crisis, particularly as a result of a decrease in expenditure on consumer durables by low-income households. Wealth inequality exceeds income inequality and increased during the downturn as a result of financial assets outperforming real assets. Nevertheless, Spain’s wealth inequality is moderate by international standards, as ownership of real assets is more widespread than in other countries. The way inequality has evolved during the early stages of the current economic recovery shows that falling unemployment has enabled a reduction in wage income inequality, as well as in per capita income inequality, albeit to a lesser extent. © 2018, The Author(s).","Household consumption; Household saving; Inequality; Labour supply; Personal income; Wage; Wealth","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85057344577"

This results in part from agents rationally updating their expectations during good times and hence becoming more optimistic about future economic prospects. Investors then increase their leverage and shift their portfolios toward projects that would previously have been considered too risky. So, when a downturn does eventually occur, the financial crisis and the extent of default become more severe. Whereas a general appreciation of this syndrome dates back to Minsky (1992) and even beyond, to Irving Fisher (1933), we model it formally. In addition, endogenous default introduces a pecuniary externality since investors do not factor in the impact of their decision to take risk and default on the borrowing cost.

Many merchants choose to launch promotion activities through some social media platforms. Price discounts can dramatically increase sales volume in social e-commerce due to the interaction of online consumers. It is urgent for e-commerce merchants to learn rules about discount information dissemination in social media, so as to formulate reasonable discount strategies and achieve sustainable business. This paper constructs an evolutionary game model for e-commerce platforms and merchants when they implement promotion strategies through social media, investigates discount information dissemination among consumers under multiple situations by introducing price discount parameters, and further discusses the influence mechanism of discount size and platform reputation on consumers' purchase behavior. Results show that in low-reputation e-commerce platforms, the price discount is the main motivation to purchase. Consumers' preference for the high discount is weakened by the increase in platforms' reputation. Discounts should be set according to the different reputations. Businesses in a high-reputation environment are relatively more profitable. E-commerce businesses should work together, apply reasonable pricing, and improve their quality to create a green and healthy shopping environment, in order to get benefits and sustainable development. © 2020 by the authors.","Behavior modeling; E-commerce reputation; Evolutionary game; Information dissemination; Price discount; Purchase behavior; Social e-commerce","business development; consumption behavior; electronic commerce; price dynamics; social media; viral disease","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85091525169"

A variety of methodologies have been used to understand the nature of the Asian financial crisis. However, the impact of the 1997 Asian financial crisis on the efficiency of the financial industry has yet to be studied. By employing the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) approach the present study attempts to examine for the first time the impact of the 1997 Asian financial crisis on the efficiency of the Malaysian and Thailand banking sectors, two of the East Asian countries that were severely affected by the crisis. The study focuses on three major approaches vis., intermediation, value added and operating approaches. The results clearly bring forth the high degree of inefficiency in the Malaysian and Thailand banking sectors, particularly a year after the crisis. We find that the Malaysian banking sector has exhibited a higher TE levels during the post crisis period under the intermediation and value added approaches, while TE seems to be lower under the operating approach. The empirical findings suggest that the Thailand banking sector has exhibited a lower TE level during the post crisis period under all approaches. © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Bank efficiency; Data envelopment analysis; Financial crisis; Malaysia; Multivariate regression analysis; Thailand","Far East; Malaysia; Thailand; banking; data envelopment analysis; efficiency measurement; financial crisis; financial system; multivariate analysis; regression analysis","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-77957126011"

Using U.S. county data we test the overall effect of increased industrial diversity on county level unemployment. Allowing for structured spatial spillovers across counties we find evidence supporting the notion that economic diversity within a given county is associated with lower levels of unemployment across all years of this analysis (2007–2014), while the diversity of neighboring counties was only associated with decreased unemployment at the height of the Great Recession. This spatial spillover effect was responsible for turning the overall marginal effect of diversity on unemployment significant for the period representing the height of the Great Recession and the early recovery period (2009–2011). These results suggest that it is the economic diversity of one's neighbors that provides an unemployment buffer in times of economic downturns. This spatial spillover effect represents a novel finding and it is hypothesized that diversity of one's neighbors plays an important role in assisting in the search for employment in response to an economic shock. © 2017","Diversity; Model uncertainty; Spatial econometrics; Stability; Unemployment","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85013659118"

These techniques include non-linear Support Vector Regression (SVR), a regression tree, a transformed linear model and a two-stage model combining a linear regression with SVR. We compare these models with an ordinary least squares linear regression. In addition, we incorporate several variants of 11 macroeconomic indicators to estimate the influence of the economic state on loan losses. The out-of-time set-up is complemented with an out-of-sample set-up to mitigate the limited number of credit crisis observations available in credit risk data sets. The two-stage/transformed model outperforms the other techniques when forecasting out-of-time for the home equity/corporate data set, while the non-parametric regression tree is the best performer when forecasting out-of-sample. The incorporation of macroeconomic variables significantly improves the prediction performance. The downturn impact ranges up to 5% depending on the data set and the macroeconomic conditions defining the downturn. These conclusions can help financial institutions when estimating LGD under the internal ratings-based approach of the Basel Accords in order to estimate the downturn LGD needed to calculate the capital requirements. Banks are also required as part of stress test exercises to assess the impact of stressed macroeconomic scenarios on their Profit and Loss (P&L) and banking book, which favours the accurate identification of relevant macroeconomic variables driving LGD evolutions. © 2014 Operational Research Society Ltd.

These patterns are markedly stronger for investors in low cost and low turnover funds relative to investors in high cost and high turnover funds, consistent with sophisticated investors being more sensitive to changing conditions. Benchmarked against a buy-and-hold strategy, these asset allocation strategies reduce risk without degrading the risk-return trade-off.

To this end, ""relationally integrated value networks"" (RIVANS) are conceptualised to engage and empower network members towards well-focused collaboration that adds value. The aim is to identify the routes towards achieving the desirable integration together with the desired ""overall value"" that includes the hitherto often neglected ""whole life"" and end-user priorities. Design/methodology/approach: Two case studies of enlightened team working are used to examine the power of RIVANS to add value. Deliberations at two subsequent workshops identified the potential for furthering the RIVANS approach and operationalising the value propositions. Findings: Relational integration in networks adds considerable value to projects. Cross-fertilisation benefits accrue when RIVANS members also participate in other value networks that also include other facilities managers. Research limitations/implications: Relational agendas have grown steadily over the last 15 years. There is scope for further development for benefits of clients and the supply network. This is despite an apparent retreat from a focus on differentiation to a re-emerging cost focus. Practical implications: Each network can benefit from healthy inputs from, and benchmarking against, other networks. The strengths of each network will be enhanced by the steady development of each of its members, mutual feedback and collaborative learning opportunities. Originality/value: The need for, and potential impact of RIVANS are heightened in the present major economic downturn. Relationally integrated networks can be more resilient, while adding value and building market share through collaborative efficiencies throughout the life cycles of built assets. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Asset valuation; Integration; Team working","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-78049519125"

The purpose of this paper is to explore the impact of these determinants on product and process innovation. Determining the impact of these dimensions of innovation on the market performance of a company is also an aim of the present study. Design/methodology/approach: A research study was carried out on a sample of 433 Greek manufacturing and service companies. Data were obtained through a structured questionnaire from the chief executive officers of the companies. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses are applied to extract and validate all the latent factors considered in the suggested model, while their relationships are determined through structural equation modeling. Findings: The analysis of the empirical data shows that both the dimensions of company innovation examined in the present study (product and process innovation) are positively influenced by the quality practices of top management and process quality management. Improving these two dimensions of company innovation, in turn, results in increased market performance. Research limitations/implications: First, the sample of the responding manufacturing and service Greek companies which includes both small and medium-sized enterprises and large companies and which operate in circumstances of financial crisis; second, the subjective data collected from only one company representative; and third, the examination of only two factors influencing company innovation, are the main limitations of the present study. Based on these limitations, future research studies are recommended. Practical implications: The empirically validated theoretical model of the present study can guide the policy makers of a company to select a quality management and innovation strategy through which the company can lay the foundations to increase its market performance, and thus, overcome the current economic downturn and financial crisis. Researchers can also use the suggested valid model as an assessment tool, a benchmarking tool and a tool for the design of their future research studies. Originality/value: The present study contributes to the literature by determining a valid model that describes simultaneously the relationships between quality management factors, product and process innovation and market performance. This is also the first study reflecting Greek companies' efforts to withstand the current downturn and penetrate the market through innovation. © 2018 Emerald Publishing Limited.","Market performance; Process quality management; Product and process innovation; Quality practices; Top management","Commerce; Computer supported cooperative work; Industrial research; Manufacture; Quality management; Market performance; Process Innovation; Process quality managements; Quality practice; Top management; Innovation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85038816551"

The paper argues, based on a range of observations, that a substantial slowdown was looming for Ireland by 2007, independent of what was going to happen in the global economy, and much of this evidence was ignored in the implementation of economic policy. The result was a range of policies based on an unwarranted over-optimism which left Ireland terribly exposed to the international downturn.

To this end, data emanating from a telephone and patron survey were combined. A random and representative sample of 3.404 people participated in the telephone survey and 2.400 in the patron survey. The interview schedule was the same in both studies. The presence of problem gambling was assessed with the Canadian Problem Gambling Index. Information on participants’ socio-economic and demographic characteristics as well as their ways of dealing financially with the crisis were collected. Findings indicated that 2.4% of respondents met criteria for problem gambling. Male gender, minority status, living with family of origin, low educational level and low to zero income were found to constitute the risk factors of the disorder. Moreover, having started gambling during the recession increased the odds of suffering from problem gambling; however this finding was gender-specific. Thus, people end up in problem gambling through various pathways, with these trajectories being different for men and women.

We do not find support to the hypothesis that the improvement in relative valuation of diversified firms during economic downturns is attributed to the ability of diversified firms to utilize broader external capital markets. We demonstrate that the improvement in relative valuation is largely driven by diversified firms that are financially constrained, and, therefore, attribute the observed improvement to more efficient internal capital allocation during recessions. © 2014 The Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois.","Corporate diversification; Recessions; Relative firm value","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84922164955"

Our primary objective is an investigation of the specific mechanisms that connect economic conditions to the perception of immigrants as a threat. We therefore also contribute to theoretical discussions based on group threat and realistic group conflict theory by exposing the dominant source of competition relevant to these relationships. Furthermore, we investigate whether people react more sensitive to short-term economic dynamics within countries than to the long-term economic circumstances.

The macro-economic indicators we use include GDP per capita, unemployment, and national debt levels, covering the most salient economic dimensions. We furthermore control for the country’s migration situation and aggregate party positions toward cultural diversity. Our results show that the dynamic short-term developments of the economy and migration within countries are of greater relevance for perceived immigrant threat than the long-term situation. In contrast, the long-term political climate appears to be more important than short-term changes in the aggregate party positions.

Despite economic downturn, one major impact of global pandemic is the rise of ‘infodemic’ and ‘disinfodemic’, which actually creates challenge for the public to access reliable information when they require it. News media plays a crucial role in such stressful situations by providing timely and accurate information about the pandemic. Nevertheless, when the news verification and gatekeeping is weak, dissemination of false information within the infodemic can result in the toxic disinfodemic of disinformation and misinformation. It is imperative to recognize that journalists, especially in restrained environments (like Pakistan), can combat infodemic and disinfodemic about the pandemic when their safety and accessibility to needed information are guaranteed, and when they are not prone to diverse challenges. Therefore, drawing on Reese’s hierarchy of influences model, this study seeks to explore the various levels of influences that impact on the Pakistani journalists’ reporting and their ability to deal with the challenges of infodemic and disinfodemic amid COVID-19 pandemic.

Using retrospective data, we relate the divergent period conditions represented by each cohort to the process of labor market incorporation and other facets of first employment, namely first occupation, class of worker, and firm size. The analysis tests human capital, new international division of labor, and household strategy explanations of the response of female employment to macro-economic fluctuations. Results indicate that rising levels of human capital were central to increases in women's labor force participation across generations and improved labor demand conditions during growth cycles were an important impetus for women's incorporation into professional and more formal types of employment. We also find support for international division of labor perspectives, as women's representation in manufacturing (maquiladora) employment grew substantially over time. Overall, household survival theories best captured the effect of economic restructuring and globalization on women's work. Economic downturns and financial shocks triggered women's labor market incorporation, particularly among married women, lending strong support to the idea that in periods of economic uncertainty women join the labor market in order to diversify household earnings and protect against deteriorating family incomes. However, this labor market push was concentrated in domestic and self-employed occupations and in smaller firms, findings that portend challenges to the long-term prospects of women's work in Mexico.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0035511343"

In 2020, when the ongoing Covid-19 global pandemic spread across the world, it brought economic instability in its wake. Sectors of the built environment (BE), among others, were hit hard by a public health crisis followed swiftly by an unprecedented economic downturn. In 2018, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report highlighted the need for rapid and drastic action on climate change by 2030 to prevent the disastrous effects of a world warmed by more than 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels, raising the urgency of achieving the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by Member States in 2015. Even rapid decarbonisation, the report warned, would likely not be sufficient to address the intertwined problems of poverty, mass migration, politics and ecological collapse that the SDGs seek to address. Digital technology offers an opportunity to better understand and model solutions to these complex crises, but it is unclear how digital technology should be harnessed in the face of an uncertain future. Written at the beginning of this critical decade leading up to 2030, this paper looks ahead 20 years in the future to better understand the resources, technology, economy, governance, infrastructure, mobility and social factors that may shape the development of Britain's digital BE. By exploring four scenarios around the variables of i) the UK's compliance with the interconnected targets of the SDGs and ii) the size of the workforce relative to the dependent population (dependency), this paper concludes with the identification of key strategies that can lead to the sustainable development of the BE sectors, outlining a number of actions that should be combined with the path for recovery from Covid-19 and are based on digital technology and a green information economy that ensures a future better for everyone in a digital built Britain. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","2040; Built environment; Future studies; Resilience; Scenario planning; Smart cities","United Kingdom; Climate change; Planning; Public health; Built environment; Decarbonisation; Digital technologies; Economic downturn; Economic instability; Information economy; Intergovernmental panel on climate changes; Pre-industrial levels; COVID-19; future prospect; scenario analysis; smart city; strategic approach; Sustainable Development Goal; Sustainable development","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097714669"

The consequential unexpected occurrences of supply- and demand-side shocks forced the economies to trim down their growth prospects. The interplay of these shocks has generated spirals of downturns in all major economic sectors, including the financial sector in affected countries. Specifically, the stock markets immediately nosedived, following the outbreak of the global spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Thus, we examine the behaviour of the selected Asian stock markets amid the huge uncertainties of the corona pandemic and find the occurrences of volatility clustering in these markets. Such volatility clustering primarily occurred, owing to the pessimistic and panic sentiments of investors, and the increase in the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases, changes in oil prices, and exchange rates were found to be significant in channelizing the fears and uncertainties of coronavirus pandemic to cause unexpected nosedives in Asian stock markets. © 2020 Association of Asia Scholars.","Asia; COVID-19 pandemic; return volatility; stock market","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85095615688"

The Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE) Composite Index increased more than sixfold from 1,012 in 2005 to 6,124 by the end of 2007. It then declined continuously to reach a low of 1,929 on 17 September 2008, or a drop of 70 per cent from its peak in less than 10 months. Although the market downturn may have been affected by the financial crisis in the United States and the rest of the world, the extreme fluctuations of stock prices signify a big market bubble, and the burst of that bubble must be explained by intrinsic characteristics or the economic psychology of Chinese investors. Based on a detailed market data analysis, this paper attributes the development of the stock market bubble to three key psychological factors: 'greed', 'envy' and 'speculation', and the burst of the bubble to three contrasting factors: 'fear', 'lack of confidence' and 'disappointment'. It concludes that only after Chinese companies become really commercialised and profitable and investors become rational can the stock markets become stable without extreme volatility as seen in the past. Government policies can play a role in soothing market volatility detrimental to shareholders and the wider economy, but investors should not depend on government for making their own investment decisions. © Journal compilation © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","","Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East; commercialization; decision making; economic instability; financial policy; government; investment; profitability; state role; stock market","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-65449144300"

The performance of 43 dairy, food, grain, and farm supply cooperatives in the U.S. was analyzed over the period 1970-1987 using financial ratios derived from accounting data. The analysis revealed significant size and industry effects. Large regional cooperatives are more efficient in utilizing their assets to generate sales, while small regional cooperatives have higher profitability. The findings suggest that the emphasis on growth may not always produce beneficial results among agricultural cooperatives. Among the four industries studied, the dairy regional cooperatives appear to be the strongest performers, while the food marketing cooperatives are characterized by the lowest performance measures. Since both dairy and food cooperatives engage in value-added processing, this difference in performance makes it difficult to reach clear conclusions about possible advantages of disadvantages or vertical integration relative to traditional cooperative activities. Trend analysis indicates that the profitability of the agricultural cooperatives in all industry and size categories declined in response to the downturn in U.S. agriculture after 1980. While the decline in profitability was at similar rates for both large and small cooperatives, the variation of efficiency and leverage was in opposite directions. Large cooperatives may be expected to continue improving their asset utilization without relative improvement in profitability, and increasing the level of their debt in relation to equity. © 1991.","","USA; accounting data; agrarian structure; cooperative organisation; economic analysis; financial performance; performance evaluation","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-0026273552"

We identify two forms of credit risk modeling from banks' financial report disclosures: statistical modeling of the drivers of past loan losses and stress testing of future loan losses to adverse scenarios. We show that banks' credit risk-modeling disclosures are positively associated with their loan loss-provision timeliness, with the ability of their provisions to predict future loan charge-offs, and with their loan origination during downturns. We further show that these associations vary in predictable ways across the two forms of credit risk modeling when we distinguish homogeneous from heterogeneous loans and stable periods from downturns. © 2017 INFORMS.","Credit risk modeling; Disclosure; Financial crisis; Loan loss provisions; Procyclicality; Timeliness","Finance; Risk assessment; Credit risk modeling; Disclosure; Financial crisis; Loan loss provisions; Procyclicality; Timeliness; Risk perception","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85067180275"

That trend, fed by a combination of macro-economic, demographic, and political factors, intensified greatly in the 2000s when a series of financial innovations allowed American households to draw equity out of their homes while at the same time feeding an unprecedented housing boom. Those same new mechanisms of 'structured' and 'synthetic' finance mobilized a significant and steadily growing proportion of global savings and directed them into this super-bubble as the world's surplus countries came to fund America's debt-financed excess spending for perpetual reproduction of their surpluses. Anachronistic policy preferences among both surplus countries and the US prevented the proper functioning of various adjustment mechanisms before the inevitable financial-fragility dynamic took hold to burst the bubble and throw the global economy into a steep downturn. The persistence of these global imbalances bodes ill for the medium-term stability of the world economy and its recovery potential. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.","Consumer debt; Credit crunch; Financial innovation; Securitization; US current account deficit; US housing boom","United States; adjustment mechanism; debt crisis; economic instability; financial system; macroeconomics; savings","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-77953335839"

The purpose of this paper is to analyse global comparative advantage in the European Union (EU) wine industry and to test the duration and stability of trade indices. Design/methodology/approach: The paper applies the theory of comparative advantages by using the Balassa indices to European wine trade (based on the 16 biggest producers) data from the period 2000-2013. Moreover, it applies stability and duration analysis on comparative advantages calculated. Findings: Results suggest that Bulgaria, Cyprus, France, Greece, Italy, Portugal, and Spain are the highest ranked European wine producers in the world market and have the largest comparative advantages. However, duration and stability tests indicate that trade advantages have weakened for the majority of these countries. The paper discusses a number of reasons for this downturn, including changes to Common Agricultural Policy wine regulation, economic crisis, and the rise of New World wine producers. Originality/value: The originality of the paper is that it applies the theory of comparative advantage to top wine exporters in the EU. The paper also makes valuable contributions to the wine literature by analysing the duration and stability of comparative advantage in the global wine trade. Moreover, the identification of industry-specific causes for changing patterns in comparative advantage in the EU might be important to the wine industry. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Comparative advantages; Duration analysis; European Union; Wine industry","Bulgaria; Cyprus; European Union; France; Greece; Italy; market; Portugal; Spain; wine industry","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85027554522"

Thereafter, the impact of NII on risk-adjusted returns is also examined. Design/methodology/approach: Various analysis techniques are used to achieve the research objectives. Findings: The findings show a negative two-way link between NII and NIM, thus supporting the subsidisation hypothesis. Furthermore, NII is found to have a negative impact on risk-adjusted returns. When observing this relationship in sub-samples, the findings indicate that the negative impact of NII on risk-adjusted returns still holds in the first subsample (2006-2011). The coefficient of NII becomes positive but not significant for the subsequent period (2012-2015). In addition, the Spearman rank-order correlations of returns on assets and NII for both sub-samples are negative. Together, the author concludes that there are no diversification benefits in the Vietnamese banking system. Practical implications: The evidence suggests a trade-off between non-interest activities and traditional lending ones. In addition, the findings demonstrate that the Vietnamese banks may use NIIs to expand leverage and herd by coordinating NII strategy during the economic downturns. Thus, the banking system may be exposed to a greater risk. The research has implications for bank supervisors, policy-makers and bank managers.

However, the dependence of GDP levels on its history of shocks, what economists refer to as “hysteresis,” argues for unifying the analysis of growth and cycles. In this paper, we review the recent empirical and theoretical literature that motivates this paradigm shift. The renewed interest in hysteresis (or “scarring” in recent parlance) has been sparked by the persistent impact of the global financial crisis—as GDP in advanced economies remained far below the precrisis trends for over a decade—and recent concerns about the lasting impact of the COVID-19 shock. The findings of the recent literature have far-reaching conceptual and policy implications. In recessions, monetary and fiscal policies need to be more active to avoid the permanent scars of a downturn. And in good times, running a high-pressure economy could have permanent positive effects. © 2023 American Economic Association.

This phenomenon both interrogates the established association between economic downturns and their negative impact on migrant labour in low-skilled jobs and enriches the theory of the reserve army of labour, which has been applied to understanding the fragile status of migrant workers in Western economies. Secondary analysis of Labor Force Survey (LFS) and OECD data concerning the impact of the crisis on migrant labour shows that women employed in the care-domestic sector have been affected significantly less than men employed in manufacture and constructions. To explain this evidence, the article proposes a theoretical framework that draws on key concepts and debates in different strands of sociology: the increasing demand for paid care-domestic work due to the ageing population and the growth of native-born women's rates of activity; the commodification of care and the state management of migration; the affectivity and spatial fixity of care-domestic labour. All these factors contribute to configure female migrant labour, mostly employed in the reproductive sector, as a 'regular' rather than a reserve army of labour. © 2014 The Editorial Board of The Sociological Review.","Care and domestic labour; Commodification of care; Gender and migration; Global economic crisis; Reserve army of labour","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84923273644"

The objective of this paper is to explore underlying motives and decision-making in manufacturing strategy, especially with regard to re-insourcing in the automobile industry. While there has been a lot of research on the topic of 'outsourcing', its opposite has not been researched widely. Even though there are some papers on the automobile manufacturing industry, a deeper industrial insight into re-insourcing is missing. Owing to the increased amount of re-insourcing implemented during the economic crisis, the latter lends itself well to gaining a deeper understanding of the phenomenon. Six case studies - three of automobile manufacturers and three of automobile suppliers - with in-depth interviews are provided and consequently interpreted. All case studies indicate that the crisis had a significant influence on manufacturing-strategic decisions. Underutilized capacities appear to be a dominant motive for re-insourcing.

In this study, we examined the impact of the 2007 Great Recession on the R&D decisions of publicly-listed family firms in the United States. We compared family and non-family U.S. firms, excluding those in the financial sector, with total assets greater than $1 million for the period 1992 to 2015. Using the behavioral agency model, we hypothesized that among firms that were not financially constrained during the economic crisis, family firms were more likely than non-family firms to invest in R&D. The results support this hypothesis, lending credence to the notion that family firms undertook more risks when performance is below their long-term aspirations during economic downturns. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","2007 recession; Accounting ratios; Crisis investments; Family enterprise; Financial constraints; Firm performance; Innovation; R&D expenditures","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85075366367"

Nevertheless, Spain's banks have so far held up relatively well, and this article's examination of one of the leaders, Banco Santander, shows. The authors argue that the Bank's current strong position is not just attributable to Spanish regulations for conservative lending practices, or to the fact that Spanish banks did not invest in U.S. subprime mortgage products, but also to their well-established Reputational Risk Management programs. The article illustrates Banco Santander's management of reputation and proposes the bank as a paradigmatic case for the importance of dialogue and reputation in these times of turbulence. Because of this focus, the approach is largely uncritical, rather than balanced, in concentrating on how Banco Santander offers evidence of a paradigm shift in action that offers a model for effectively addressing the economic downturn.

The country experienced a serious shortage of foreign currency. The exchange rate against the U.S. dollar went from below 900 won to the dollar that summer to around 1,500 in mid-November. Foreign exchange reserves were dangerously low and this produced clear signs of panic in the market.1 On November 21, the South Korean government requested that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) provide an emergency rescue fund. Less than two weeks later on December 4, the IMF organized an unprecedented rescue package of US$56 billion to bail South Korea out of its precarious foreign exchange crisis.

Construction companies witnessed unprecedented changes in the environment, namely the coincidence of a sharp economic downturn, the significant decline of public works, a reduction in lending, increased competition, and structural changes in the marketplace. Nevertheless, little has been documented on what response strategies construction companies adopt as a result of an economic recession. Based on four exploratory case studies, a taxonomy framework of the response strategies adopted by Irish and UK construction companies during the 2007 economic recession was developed relative to Porter's generic strategies of cost leadership, differentiation, and focus. Porter's model is a well-known theoretical framework among business strategists and industrial economists worldwide. The analysis provides strong support for the adoption of cost leadership strategies as a means to surviving the 2007 economic recession.

We study empirical evidence from past downturns, discuss the relevant literature and perform an empirical analysis of recent business survey data (collected during 2009). Pivotal for our considerations is the question whether companies tend to spend more or less on R&D and innovation activities during periods of recession. We empirically analyse what general patterns can be distinguished in this regard, given the particular circumstances of the most recent crisis. Our findings suggest that company behaviour varies: some companies have recently reduced their innovation activities significantly, while others maintained them and a third group even significantly increased their activities to reap the benefits in the expected upswing. Overall, we observe a deceleration of R&D and innovation activities induced by the crisis, but the trend figures remain positive. Driven by the companies that reinforce their R&D and innovation efforts to thrive through the downturn and thus seek to gather the benefits in the upswing to come, the R&D and innovation landscape is likely to look different in the aftermath of the crisis. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","","economic conditions; economic history; financial crisis; innovation; research and development","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84866310780"

A renewable energy transition is believed to play a central role in mitigating the economic-climate paradox. While the architectural and computational power of artificial intelligence is particu larly well suited to address the challenges of massive data processing and demand forecasting during a renewable energy transition, there is very scant empirical assessment that takes a social science perspective and explores the effects of AI development on the energy transition. Purpose of the article: This paper aims to answer two key questions: One is, how does AI software development promote or inhibit the shift of energy consumption towards renewables? The other is, under what policy interventions does AI software development have a more positive effect on promoting renewable energy consumption? Methods: We employ a dataset of 62 economies covering the period 2011–2020 to analyze the impact of AI software development on the energy transition, where possible confounders, including political and economic characteristics and time-invariant elements, are controlled using fixed-effects estimation along with specified covariates. Findings & value added: AI software development can promote the energy transition towards renewables. There is suggestive evidence that the core mechanism linking such a positive relationship tends to lie in improving innovation performance in environmental monitoring rather than in green computing. Government support for R&D in renewable energy technologies is found to be significantly beneficial for harnessing the positive impact of AI software development on the energy transition. Compared to non-market-based environmental policies, market-based environmental policies have a more significant positive moderating effect on the relationship between AI software development and energy transition. © Instytut Badań Gospodarczych / Institute of Economic Research (Poland).","AI software development; energy transition; environmental monitoring; environmental policy; innovation","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85181094921"

When broader measures of training are considered, which exclude apprentices, the weight of the evidence is in favour of counter-cyclical training incidence. This paper suggests that a possible reconciliation of these findings is based on recognizing that firms may have incentives to train incumbents during a downturn and at the same time to reduce the recruitment and training of young employees, who are engaged in the transition from school to work. © 2009 Sense Publishers.","Apprenticeship training; Economic downturns","","Review","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-79953719783"

This negative perception stems from the visible impacts resulting from a continuous process of coastal wetland reclamation, as human pressure increases significantly in global coastal areas. The largest coastal wetland area in southern Portugal, the Ria Formosa, shares a similar perception, where current nature protection status often conflicts with the needed economic development. Here we explore how the economic activities influenced the wetland reclamation process in Ria Formosa, addressing namely aquaculture identified as an activity with a significant compatibilization potential. Different datasets were merged in a Geographical Information System, tracking land use change in Ria Formosa wetlands over the last 130 years at decadal intervals. Our results show that since the end of the 19th century nearly 2000 ha of wetlands were converted to anthropic environments, resulting in a 20 % natural area reduction. From 1885 until the mid-20th century, land use policy was influenced by the significant regional seafood preservation industry, with large swaths of wetlands diked, drained and excavated to give place to traditional salt farms. The following economic downturn gave place for the late industrialization of salt farms, further increasing the reclaimed wetland areas, later stalling with the recognition of the environmental importance of Ria Formosa in 1978. Aquaculture only gained momentum in 1980’s with the support of European funding, resulting in the conversion of many unproductive diked areas. However, late 20th century and current land use policy shifted to a nature conservation focus, therefore limiting the use of previously reclaimed areas, a challenge that influenced the abandonment of the modified areas. By studying the long-term change of land use in Ria Formosa, we argue that in high conservation value areas new policies should be considered that stimulate the development of an ecosystem approach to economic activities, namely aquaculture, improving simultaneously the regional environmental status and socioeconomic sustainable development. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","IMTA; Land use change; Ria Formosa; Wetland conversion; Wetland reclamation; Wetland restoration","Faro [Portugal]; Portugal; Ria Formosa; aquaculture; coastal wetland; conservation; data set; economic activity; environmental restoration; GIS; land reclamation; land use change; tracking; wetland management","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85080056937"

LFAs, their business plans and their ability to contribute towards sustainable development have been the source of much public discourse and media scrutiny in the last decade.

Rather, it contributes to a deeper understanding of CSR in the tourism sector by arguing for a more nuanced approach to external stakeholders, one which is also informed by primary empirical research from qualitative sources, and which is conceptually informed by the latest thinking from other sectors of economic activity. Important inter-regional variations exist in external stakeholders' perceptions and valorizations of CSR, they are context-specific, and they are not static as their responses to the recent downturn reveal. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","Corporate social responsibility; Low-fares airlines; Recession; Tourism; Travel; UK","United Kingdom; airline industry; corporate strategy; economic activity; economic instability; social work; stakeholder; sustainable development; tourism development; tourism economics; tourism market; travel behavior","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-79960866393"

The purpose of this paper is to test whether a firm’s macroeconomic environment moderates the efficiency of its social and environmental disclosures. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses the Bloomberg database to collect data on the FTSE 350 listed firms for the years 2007-2012. The sample is split into crisis and post-crisis periods, to study the investor reaction to social disclosures under different economic conditions. Findings: The results suggest that the effect of corporate social responsibility (CSR) disclosure on future firm performance depends on the surrounding macroeconomic environment. During tight economic situations, market participants become more self-centered and penalize firms diverting scarce resources toward non-profitable societal engagements. Moreover, the findings indicate that firms with a high participation of outside directors and low accounting profit experience negative future performance when engaging in social disclosures during times of crisis. Practical implications: Corporate governance is a system of interconnected practices that is affected by various firm and environmental characteristics. The results are in line with the premise that, depending on macroeconomic changes and specific firm attributes, CSR reporting may have dissimilar implications across different situations and conditions. Social disclosures and engagements are not always favorable, and should only be utilized in non-recessionary periods by firms possessing certain characteristics in terms of board composition and accounting profitability. Originality/value: This study identifies key moderating variables which present additional obstacles for firms engaging in CSR during adverse economic conditions. Outsiders’ inferior firm-specific expertise, along with the firm’s poor accounting performance, present additional financial constraints for firms engaging in CSR activities during economic downturns. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Financial crisis; Firm performance; Outside directors; Social and environmental disclosure","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85042599236"

Second, in the newer and weaker democracies, the effect of economic turbulence has been the defeat of democratically elected governments but not the demise of democracy.

Previous research in the UK has focused on variations in government spending across regions, the effects of competitive tendering processes and EU State Aid rules on regional economies. Empirical studies of procurement at the level of local authorities have received less attention. Increasing pressure to be 'efficient and effective' in use of public resources can contradict the need to support local communities, particularly through a period of economic downturn. Until recently, there has been a paucity of relevant data at a local level to examine the impacts of procurement. This paper analyses the combined patterns of spend of eight Local Authorities in the County of Cumbria in North West England. The characteristics of the supply base are investigated using a two-stage survey of businesses that secure local authority contracts. Results show the characteristics of suppliers and their level of dependency on local authority contracts. Managers' evaluation of the advantages and disadvantages of contracting with the public sector are also analysed. The findings suggest that many small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Cumbria rely upon local authority contracts for business stability. The interviews confirm the vulnerability of SMEs to the current trend towards more formal approaches to public procurement and the use of a narrow definition of 'value for money'. The paper concludes by considering the implications of the findings for the extent to which local authorities have retained a capacity to act to support local economic development. © The Author(s) 2010.","Cumbria; local authorities; local economy; new public sector management; public procurement; sustainable procurement; value for money","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-79959251751"

If they do respond, are their responses simply neglect of areas associated with corporate social performance (CSP) or do they also cut back on positive programs such as profit sharing, public/private housing programs, or charitable contributions? In this paper, we argue that because CSP-related actions and programs tend to be discretionary, they are likely to receive less attention during tough economic times, a result of cost-cutting efforts. However, the various CSP performance areas vary in terms of their resource requirements and their influence on financial performance (short- and long-term), which suggests that firms may respond differently depending on area. Consequently, in addition to examining CSP concerns separately from positive actions and programs (CSP strengths), we also examine the influence of economic growth across the five areas of diversity, employee relations, the environment, product quality/safety, and the community. Based on data from 837 firms over 15 years, our results suggest that firms neglect some areas associated with CSP during economic downturns, resulting in increased concerns about community and employee relations, product safety/quality, and the environment. However, this relationship does not apply to positive actions and programs. Instead, firms tend to increase their positive CSP programs in areas such as diversity, employee relations, and the environment during periods of slow economic growth and reduce them when the economy picks up. We offer potential explanations for our findings and discuss their importance to research on CSP. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Corporate social performance; Corporate social responsibility; Economic cycles; Measurement of social performance; Recession","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84926387513"

The empirical context is a large sample of firms registered in the United Kingdom, drawn from the FAME database. The analysis provides evidence for significant impact of business group affiliations on firm growth, especially during adverse economic conditions. However, the business group-firm growth relationship is moderated by firm-specific characteristics (e.g. firm size), and group specific characteristics (e.g. type of ownership and country of origin). Regarding the latter, it is specifically revealed that the impact of group affiliation is not uniform across all countries, a possibility that has been ignored in the international business literature.

The bursting of the dotcom bubble and the extended bear market of 2000 to 2002 prompted Congress to pass the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which was directed at core aspects of corporate governance. At the end of the decade came the bursting of the housing bubble, followed by a severe credit crunch, and the worst economic downturn in decades. In response, Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Act, which changed vast swathes of financial regulation. Among these changes were a number of significant corporate governance reforms. This book asks two questions about these changes. First, are they a good idea that will improve corporate governance? Second, what do they tell us about the relative merits of the federal government and the states as sources of corporate governance regulation? Traditionally, corporate law was the province of the states. Today, however, the federal government is increasingly engaged in corporate governance regulation. The changes examined in this work provide a series of case studies in which to explore the question of whether federalization will lead to better outcomes. The book analyzes these changes in the context of corporate governance, executive compensation, corporate fraud and disclosure, shareholder activism, corporate democracy, and declining US capital market competitiveness. © 2012 by Oxford University Press, Inc.

Government, farmers' union, academic and media discourses all describe the ensuing years as a period of financial hardship for farm families. Based on aggregate statistics, the majority of these discourses reflect and 'naturalise' the government's neo-liberal stance, thus conveying an implicit assumption that farmers' experiences were determined by the economic efficiency of the farm enterprise. Drawing upon case study data and a holistic conceptual approach to the family farm, this paper contests such narratives, arguing that farm-level experiences of agricultural restructuring during (and after) the rural downturn were contingent upon a much greater array of factors. These included: the characteristics of the farm enterprise, household and property; actors' individual attributes; and the local context's biophysical, economic and cultural fabrics. The paper concludes by arguing that a full appreciation of the contingency of farm-level experiences requires an adequate recognition of the nexus of relations between the family farm, individual actor, and local context.","","New Zealand; agrarian reform; economic reform; family farm; neoliberalism; rural economy","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0038694678"

Using a panel of OECD countries from 1980 to 2005, the results show that social spending has expansionary effects on GDP. In particular, we find that an increase of 1 per cent in social spending increases GDP by about 0.1 percentage points, which, given the share of social spending in GDP, corresponds to a multiplier of about 0.6. The effect is similar to that of total government spending, and it is larger in periods of severe downturns. Among spending subcategories, social spending on health and on unemployment benefits have the greatest effects. Social spending also positively affects private consumption, while it has negligible effects on investment.

This study builds on prior literature by extending the investigation of this association to 48 of the 50 U.S. states using National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System (NCANDS) data on child maltreatment reports from 2004 to 2013. Since the effects of economic recessions are not equally distributed in society, this study also examines whether the association between macroeconomic recessions (measured using large-scale involuntary job losses) and child maltreatment reports differs by the level of income inequality in states. Using a fixed-effects regression approach, we find that involuntary job losses are associated with increased rates of physical abuse reports, but not reports of other types of child maltreatment. We also find that the effects on reports on physical abuse and other types of maltreatment are largest in states with relatively low levels of income inequality. This surprising finding may be explained by the worse prospects of reemployment in low-inequality states, where families may experience more stress and uncertainty related to job losses. © 2020","","article; child abuse; data system; economic recession; human; neglect; physical abuse; stress; uncertainty","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85081238081"

It argues that Weekley has not fully appreciated the context for local population losses, namely the emergence of a new structural relationship between people, households, and dwellings, and the growing tension between production and consumption interests in rural locales. Moreover, the paper disputes claims that depopulation is triggered by the actions of either the landowner or the planner. Drawing on case study material informed by critical realism, it argues that planners and landowners have been drawn into an asymmetrical power relationship. This has tended to buttress landed interests and, in so doing, reproduce mechanisms which protect the less populous communities from growth and change. Intensive enquiries have unravelled a number of ways in which landowner strategic conduct can set causal chains in motion which culminate in a localised population downturn. These cannot be recovered through a positivist methodology which presupposes that cause, catalyst and outcome will coexist in time-space.","","Demography; Developed Countries; Economics; Europe; Evaluation Studies; Geography; Great Britain; Population; Population Dynamics; Population Growth; Rural Population; Social Planning; Socioeconomic Factors; UK; Consumption; Critique; Demographic Factors; Developed Countries; Development Planning; Economic Factors; Europe; Geographic Factors; Land Tenure; Macroeconomic Factors; Northern Europe; Population; Population Decrease--determinants; Population Dynamics; Population Growth; Production; Rural Development; Rural Spatial Distribution--changes; Socioeconomic Factors; Spatial Distribution; United Kingdom; counterurbanisation; landowners role; planning impact; rural depopulation; article; Consumption; Critique; Demographic Factors; demography; developed country; Development Planning; Economic Factors; economics; Europe; evaluation; Geographic Factors; geography; Land Tenure; Macroeconomic Factors; Northern Europe; policy; population; Population Decrease--determinants; population dynamics; population growth; Production; Rural Development; rural population; Rural Spatial Distribution--changes; socioeconomics; spatial distribution; United Kingdom","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0030618164"

In tandem, there has been an associated increase on the demand for debt advice. Using data from the English and Welsh Civil and Social Justice Survey, this article explores how debt problems are experienced across the population and goes on to contextualize the distinct nature of debt problems and their relationship to other problems of everyday life. Findings reaffirm the increased vulnerability to debt problems experienced by socially excluded groups, such as lone parents, those with a long-term illness or disability and the people with no academic qualification. Results go further to demonstrate that vulnerability is not constant but is also influenced by broader economic and social factors; in particular, findings demonstrate how problems directly associated with the economic downturn increase vulnerability to unmanageable debt and financial difficulty. Given this relationship, and the prolonged longevity of debt problems compared with other problem types, we would expect to see an increase in the experience of debt problems as the effects of the recession become fully apparent, and for some time thereafter. Discussion focuses upon the policy relevance of findings to frontline debt counselling and advice services operating within an increasingly tighter financial environment. Specifically, emphasis is placed upon potential benefits of offering debt counselling and advice as part of an array of other social welfare advice services, and even working across sectors to get better penetration into hard to reach groups.","Advice; Advice services; Civil justice; Debt; Over-indebtedness; Social exclusion","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84867923635"

Young people, who are particularly at risk of suicide, may be especially vulnerable to the deterioration of labor market conditions as a result of the current economic crisis in Europe. We aimed to examine the effects of work and employment characteristics on suicidal ideation in a contemporary sample of young adults.; Results: Five percent of the sample reported suicidal ideation in the preceding 12 months.

Under conditions of economic crisis, when economic signals are relatively unambiguous, perceptions of the economy can be expected to exogenously influence government approval but this is not found when the economy is experiencing a more typical pattern of moderate growth and economic signals are more mixed. We test these arguments using British election panel surveys covering electoral cycles of moderate economic growth (1997-2001) and dramatic and negative disruption (2005-2010). We examine the most commonly employed measures of retrospective economic perceptions and estimate a range of models using structural equations modelling.

Although many studies have attempted to measure the general impacts of COVID-19, very little research has been conducted to assess its overall impact on specific tourism destinations throughout many waves of the pandemic. This research aims to explore how a tourism economy in a developing country context has been damaged after many waves of COVID-19. A typical emerging city in Vietnam experiencing three waves of the COVID-19 pandemic was selected as a case study. The study recruited 40 representatives of tourism-related organizations for in-depth interviews, while 280 questionnaires were distributed to participants from different tourism organizations. The findings indicate that the majority of tourism businesses in the examined case study seriously suffered from the pandemic, and very few tourism-related enterprises were able to recover after the first wave of infection. Unfortunately, the tourism business sectors were found to be on the brink of bankruptcy or facing permanent shutdown after the third wave. All tourism enterprises generally appeared to experience a sharp drop in the number of customers, tourism revenue, service facilities and exploitation, as well as employee downsizing, but the degree of downturn differed among the examined enterprises. Among the tourism enterprises, travel agencies and the accommodation sector were found to suffer the greatest economic losses compared to other stakeholders. In general, the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on the tourism business in Vietnam is a big concern, which may require a timely economic policy response and financial scheme to better support local enterprises in coping with the challenges during post-pandemic recovery. © 2021 by the authors.

This paper undertakes a discourse-centered examination, focusing on key storylines about uranium mining in Greenland; here conflicting spatial storylines about ""saving"" or ""destroying"" the local community often appear. The analytical focus on storylines and frontier stories reveals that considerable power is embedded in structured ways of seeing, which causes certain things to seem fixed and important, while other elements appear to be problematic or absent. The production of storylines has facilitated a discursive paradigm shift which has turned mining in Greenland into mining for Greenland, as well as stabilized an argument about mining as the primary road to development. This article argues that investments in mining are also investments into different spatial development futures for local communities co-constructed by politicians, the media, NGOs, the mining sector as well as the local stakeholders. The analysis incorporates knowledge and experiences from a continuing ethnographic case study in Narsaq, a community close to Greenland's potentially biggest mine of rare earth elements and uranium, and also includes insights from the public debate on uranium taking place at various locations. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Discourses; Greenland; Local community; Mining; Politics; Storylines; Uranium","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84950987775"

This paper reviews economic literature on the longer-run health impacts of business-cycle fluctuations and recessions. Previous studies show that an economic downturn, which affects people through increased unemployment, lower incomes and increased uncertainty, will have significant consequences on people's health outcomes both in the short and longer term. The health effects caused by these adverse macroeconomic conditions will be complex and will differ across generations, regions and socio-economic groups. Groups that are vulnerable to poor health are likely to be hit hardest even if the crisis hit all individuals equally, and we already see that some groups such as young workers and women are worse hit by the recession than others.

We develop hypotheses on how firms adjust their geographic and product market scope in response to the economic crisis. Using data on acquisitions in Italy during the period 2007-2010, we analyze whether firms use acquisitions to enter and/or expand the firm's presence in different product markets and different geographic markets before and during the economic crisis. Results suggest that the crisis negatively affects the likelihood of both diversifying and crossborder acquisitions, which is consistent with the behavioral theory of the firm. As a response to economic downturns, firms tend to focus on their core business as well as their home market, suggesting they are more reluctant to explore new industrial and geographical markets. We then rely on the diversification literature to link acquisitions to firm performance. We find that diversifying acquisitions have a negative effect on short-term accounting performance in crisis times. Crossborder acquisitions have a positive impact on short-term accounting performance in crisis times, although this impact tends to become weaker (though not significantly) than during non-crisis times. We lastly discuss the implications of these findings for managers and scholars. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","","Enterprise resource planning; Finance; Behavioral theory of the firms; Cross-border acquisitions; Economic crisis; Economic downturn; Firm Performance; Geographic market; Geographical market; Product markets; Commerce","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84995505485"

Linking conservation of resources theory (e.g., Hobfoll, Am. Psychol., 44, 513) with crossover research (e.g., Westman, Hum. Relat., 54, 717), we proposed that a partner's job insecurity constitutes an additional resource threat. Thus, the partner's job insecurity would exacerbate a person's negative reaction to his or her own job insecurity in terms of attitudinal (i.e., work engagement) and both health- and withdrawal-related outcomes (i.e., psychological health and turnover intention). Using a time-lagged design and multisource data from 171 mixed-gender dual-earner couples, multilevel path analysis applying the Actor-Partner-Interdependence Model revealed interesting gender differences. The negative relationship between the husband's job insecurity and his work engagement was stronger, the higher his wife's job insecurity was. The data further showed a moderated mediation, such that the husband's job insecurity was negatively and indirectly related to both psychological health and turnover intention (via reduced work engagement) if his wife experienced a medium or high level of job insecurity. Our study demonstrates the interactive effects of stressors in dual-earner couples, and highlights the importance of overcoming an overly individualistic perspective when studying job insecurity in particular and stressors more generally. Practitioner points: Job insecurity has become a highly potent stressor for a large number of employees nowadays. In the context of dual-earner couples, we demonstrate that husbands react more negatively to job insecurity if their wives experience job insecurity too. Dual-earner couples are advised to diversify their occupational background, such that economic downturns in one industry sector are less likely to hit both partners. Due to the fact that particularly husbands were affected by the job insecurity of their wives, it is important to tailor psychotherapeutic approaches to this group. Because men are usually more reluctant to approach psychotherapeutic counselling, the rise of job insecurity underscores the need to circumvent chronic mental health problems with adequate interventions. Companies are advised to communicate with their employees in a transparent way, such that employees can better cope with organizational plans relating to mergers, acquisitions, and downsizing. © 2017 The British Psychological Society","dual-earner couples; health; job insecurity; stress; work engagement","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85011706628"

Design/methodology/approach: The paper takes the form of an investigation that is both quantitative and qualitative. The study was split into three phases: understand the issues affecting researchers (focus groups and interviews); an online survey of 6,344 researchers measuring attitudes and digging deeper into issues: telephone interviews to understand differences between different groups change. Differences in opinions were examined across discipline. Findings: While there has been some change in the behaviour of researchers, there has been little change in their motivations for publication. Researchers want other researchers' data but are less inclined to share their own. Researcher attitudes towards repositories are very mixed. Researchers highly value peer review. The pressure to over-publish at the expense of quality is exaggerated. Research limitations/implications: Further research is required to measure the impact on researcher motivations and attitudes of external pressures that were emerging at the time of this study. This includes the growing influence of funding bodies, the economic downturn and its impact on institutional budgets, as well as subsequent advances in the digital revolution. Practical implications: This research suggests that, while technology may have positively impacted the efficiency of scholarly communication, the drivers behind scholarly information exchange remain relatively unchanged. Moreover, changes to the scholarly information business model will only be successful if they continue to satisfy the underlying motivations and needs of researchers. Originality/value: This paper fulfils an identified need to measure the motivations of researchers towards the core functions of scholarly communication on a global level. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Attitudes; Individual behaviour; Information exchange; Motivation (psychology); Peer review; Research","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-79952294051"

Our results show that the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown caused Mexico's formal sector to contract by 5% by November of 2020. By August, men's jobs started to recover, while women's jobs remain stagnant. We then document heterogeneous effects by age, income, size of the firms, and economic sector activity. The most affected economic agents during the pandemic include the youngest workers (15–29- years-old), oldest workers (over 60 years old), low-income earners, small-sized firms (6−50 workers), medium-sized firms (51−250 workers), workers in the construction industry, and the hospitality-focused service sectors. Finally, we test different state-level factors that may explain heterogeneity within Mexico: state-level reopenings and lockdowns, infection risk, and stimulus payments. Our findings suggest more considerable employment losses in states that experienced successive lockdowns. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","COVID-19; Labor; Latin America; Mexico","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85099577081"

The rebound effect has played a role in economic growth and industrialization, yet it remains a problem for the task of reducing negative environmental impacts. This paper proposes that the size of the rebound effect, and the type of impacts it causes, may be affected by future changes in the system within which it arises. Four types of rebound effect are considered: economy-wide effects, transformational effects, frontier effects, and international rebound effects. A conceptual model of the historical role of the rebound effect in socio-technical systems, and the relationship of socio-technical systems with natural capital and human-created capital, provides a ""sandbox"" for testing ideas about the future. The model theory draws upon the concepts of natural capital, the Global Ecological Footprint, and the Great Acceleration. How the size of four types of the rebound effect might change in future, as supplies of resources from natural capital become more constrained, is discussed within three storylines. In the first storyline, natural capital declines but remains fairly stable; rebound is much decreased as resources are less available and efficiency is used up more in stabilizing supplies of goods and services. In the second storyline, growth continues without constraint amid regional rivalry; eventually there is a strong downturn in availability of resources and negative impacts on both society and natural capital. In the third storyline, impact caps are implemented for different types of resources; for some time, industry and society adapt by investing in low resource-use innovation and global cooperation on management of natural capital; once natural capital recovers and stabilizes, growth and consumption may increase along with the rebound effect, but staying within a Global Ecological Footprint of 1 Earth. The theory and model in this paper are intended to contribute to new thinking on the subject of the rebound effect. © 2018 Freeman.","Global Ecological Footprint; Natural capital; Socio-technical systems; System dynamics; The rebound effect","Environmental impact; Industrial economics; Natural resources management; Ecological footprint; Natural capital; Rebound effect; Sociotechnical systems; System Dynamics; Economic analysis","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85052849073"

A dynamic panel data model was used to empirically analyse the impact of R&D intensity on business performance. A generalised method of moments estimator was adopted to avoid endogeneity problems caused by adding dynamics to the model. Further, the model was used to explore the impact of the lag effect of R&D investments on business performance. It was found that significant R&D investments in a given period may reduce business performance in the same period and continue to influence it in the next few periods, thus indicating the presence of a positive and lagged effect of R&D investments in the high-tech industry. Firm size was also found to be positively correlated with business performance, that is, the larger the firm size, the greater is the use of resources for R&D, which, in turn, leads to more sophisticated technologies and profitable outcomes, forming a positive cycle. This indicates that R&D expenditures affect firms’ sustainable management. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

The economic downturn that began in 2009 may have caused European parties to abandon their commitment to environmentalism as they focused on solutions to the economic crisis. Particularly in Central and Eastern Europe, where commitment to the environment is not as central to party competition, public environmental concerns may have been placed on the periphery of the policy agenda. Examining this issue, this study finds that political parties, especially mainstream parties, in Western Europe represented economic and environmental preferences of voters about equally as well in 2013 as they did prior to the economic crisis. However, in Central and Eastern Europe, parties tended to be less responsive to environmental preferences, presumably because economic differences dominate political divisions in newer democracies. It is concluded that environmental interests are well protected by mainstream actors in the West, though less so in Europe’s newer democracies. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","Eastern Europe; environmental policy; political parties; public opinion","Central Europe; Eastern Europe; Western Europe; democracy; environmental policy; environmental politics; environmentalism; financial crisis; party politics","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84929841762"

This article examines correlations between climate and history in the Byzantine southern Levant (c. 4th–7th centuries AD). A proposed 5th century economic downturn attested to by numismatic trends is shown to coincide with palaeoclimatic evidence for drought. We suggest a climatic ultimate cause for the apparent economic decline. In addition, the relationship between the Dust Veil Index (DVI) and annual precipitation in Jerusalem suggests the likelihood of increased precipitation following the 536 AD volcanic dust veil. This prediction is borne out by high-resolution precipitation reconstructions from Soreq Cave speleothems and by sedimentation records of extreme flash flooding. These finds complement palaeoclimatic reconstructions from Europe showing a drop in precipitation after 536 AD. Drought in Europe and flooding in the Middle East are both expected outcomes of global cooling during volcanic winters, such as those described in historical accounts of the 530s AD. © 2017, © Council for British Research in the Levant 2017.","536 AD dust veil; Byzantine Levant; climate history; missing century; palaeoclimate change","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85030837925"

However, male fertility can be an important issue for exploring how economic and employment uncertainties relate to fertility and family dynamics. Objective: This paper intends to study fertility variations over time, relying solely on data referring to father's socio-demographic characteristics; in particular, their age, education level, and employment status. Methods: We use a combination of Labor Force Survey and Demographic Statistics data on population and Vital Statistics on births to estimate male fertility indicators and fertility differentials by education level and employment status, for the period 1992-2011 in Greece. In addition, over-time developments in male TFR are separated into structural (education-specific and employment-specific distributions) and behavioral (fertility, per se) changes. Results: We find that the male fertility level is declining, the fertility pattern is moving into higher ages, and the reproduction period for men is getting shorter. From 1992 up to 2008, changes in male fertility were mostly driven by behavioral rather than compositional factors. However, the decline of male fertility over the period of economic recession (2008-2011) is largely attributed to the continuous decrease in the proportions of employed men. Conclusions: The study suggests that male fertility merits further exploration. In particular, years of economic downturn and countries where household living standards are mostly associated with male employment, a father's employability is likely to emerge as an increasingly important factor of fertility outcomes. © 2014 Alexandra Tragaki and Christos Bagavos.","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84906048084"

The imperatives faced by companies seeking to secure their future competitiveness can be better appreciated through an understanding of the sustainability landscape, and this paper seeks to examine perspectives on environmental, social and governance issues from CEOs in the emerging markets. Design/methodology/approach: The paper is based on extensive conversations with business leaders, both through the authors' work with leading multinational companies and their survey of over 800 global CEOs conducted in partnership with the United Nations Global Compact - the largest CEO study on sustainability to date. In the spirit of contributing to the debate on corporate sustainability, the paper presents the findings not as an academic submission, but rather as a reflective practitioner paper based on the authors' applied research. Their intention throughout is to faithfully report the views of the CEOs interviewed and surveyed, offering in places the beginnings of their own explanation of their results, and highlighting areas for future research and engagement by academics and educators. Findings: As one looks towards the next decade, and new waves of growth, it is clear that CEOs are beginning to recognize the scale of the challenge they face in aligning sustainability with core business. They also recognize, however, that this transition will depend on the economy's most powerful force, business - and that, with immediate and sustained action, individual companies can play a critical role in building the foundations of a more sustainable economy. From the wide-ranging set of interviews and survey responses, it seems that nowhere does this seem to be more keenly felt than in the emerging markets, and it is hoped that this is a timely and useful contribution to advancing the debate, with a unique insight into the views of CEOs and global leaders on what it will take to reach a new era of sustainability. Originality/value: This paper, based on extensive conversations with an unprecedented set of leading global CEOs, presents perspectives of leading CEOs in the emerging markets. By examining the forces shaping businesses' response to societal demands and the challenges of corporate sustainability, the authors set out some of the ways in which business is responding - and some of the capabilities that will be required to secure companies' competitiveness on the journey to a new era of sustainability. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Corporate social responsibility; Emerging markets; Environmental management; Governance; Social; Sustainability","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-80051676378"

Prices change more with each dollar transacted (pushing the Amihud illiquidity measure up) and bid-ask spreads widen. More generally, econometric estimates show that large price downturns, typical of crises, are associated with higher trading activity and increased trading costs, with trading activity declining only later as crises progress. Thus, although trading activity tends to be negatively related to trading costs during tranquil times (and across securities), this relation appears to break down during crises.

Research describes a correlation between adverse economic conditions and support for radical parties campaigning on the populist promise to retake the country from a corrupt elite. But does the success of radical parties following economic crises rely on people who are directly affected? To answer this question, we examine whether individual-level changes in economic circumstances drive support for radical parties across the ideological divide. Analysing eight waves of panel data collected in the Netherlands, before, during, and after the Great Recession (2007-2015), we demonstrate that people who experienced an income loss became more supportive of the radical left but not of the radical right. Looking at these parties' core concerns, we find that income loss increased support for income redistribution championed by the radical left, but less so for the anti-immigration policies championed by the radical right. Our study establishes more directly than extant research the micro-foundations of support for radical parties across the ideological divide. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

However, to art and design educators, the pervasiveness and apparent exclusivity of STEM can be viewed as another instance of art and design education being relegated to the margins of curriculum (Greene, 1995). In the spirit of interdisciplinarity, there have been some recent calls to expand STEM education to include the arts and design, transforming STEM into STEAM in education (Maeda, 2013). As with STEM, STEAM education emphasises the connections between previously disparate disciplines, meaning that education has been conceptualised in different ways, such as focusing on the creative design thinking process that is fundamental to engineering and art (Bequette & Bequette, 2012). In this article, we discuss divergent creative design thinking process and metacognitive skills, how, and why they may enhance learning in STEM and STEAM.","Convergent; Design; Design process; Divergent; Education; STEAM; STEM; Thinking","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85021122947"

This proportion has increased during the economic crisis, especially in those countries which were particularly affected by economic downturn and rising unemployment. We extend existing entrepreneurship theories to account for this phenomenon, which we call “nons-entrepreneurship”. Testing the hypotheses derived from our model, we find that the primary motivation for these people to turn to entrepreneurship is the lack of other options to enter the labour market during the economic crisis.

At the same time, the mean age at first childbirth has grown continually, seriously hindering any sustained recovery of fertility. Cohort fertility, in turn, has declined uninterruptedly since the 1941 cohort, and according to all estimates, this will drop to 1.6 for women born in the 1960s. A downturn in nuptiality, which has not been offset by a rise in consensual unions, along with the prevalence of contraceptives and abortion, have contributed substantially to falling fertility. Underlying this decrease is the profound cultural, social, and economic change that has raised the perceived costs of leaving the parental home and having children. The lack of any explicit family policy or transfers to compensate for such costs has reinforced that perception. © 2008 Delgado, Meil & Zamora López.","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-46849104025"

First, the euro’s design was a political choice skewed toward deflationary adjustment policies in hard times, leading to falling incomes and employment in the periphery. Second, the institutional incentives of the Eurozone are the opposite for export-driven coordinated market economies and demand-led mixed market economies during booms and downturns, respectively. During the euro crisis, the Eurozone’s Northern countries gained at the expense of the Southern ones, while at the same time seeing lower domestic inequality compared to increased inequality in the periphery. This diverging pattern of European inequality was exacerbated by EU economic policy drift, the lack of any real national democratic choice in the periphery, and the growing importance of organized financial interests in Brussels. © 2016 SAGE Publications.","Capital; Economic policy; Euro; Inequality; Institutions; Labor; Varieties of capitalism","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84983006884"

The relative importance of alternative strategies among firms of difference sizes operating in different industries during an economic recession is also examined. Correlation analysis indicates good fit; that is, most firms are following a consistent set of real estate strategies to support either Revenue Growth or Profitability Growth, which lends support to the theoretical model. In addition, most firms are making office space decisions consistent with a strategic corporate real estate management approach rather than resorting to ad hoc real estate decisions during the recession. A majority of the firms are pursuing profitability through cost reduction, productivity and flexibility, rather than revenue generation, focusing on survival during the economic downturn.

However, we did not detect an overall mean-level change in opposition to inequality or support for government intervention.

This paper examines outcomes of children in households that experience IPHS. Reports of 325 IPHS cases among adults age 18-44 in the U. S. between 1999 and 2004 were collected and examined. Results indicate children were often fatally wounded, but were most likely to witness the eventthen be absent or killed. Difficult financial conditions during times of economic downturn may increase the possibility of stress-related suicide, and subsequent familicide. Children with a suicidal parent are at increased risk of harm, so identification is of vital importance. Children are most likely harmed or killed by a primarily suicidal male perpetrator, who is usually their biological father. Firearms were used more than other methods in IPHS events. Even those perpetrators with protective orders more often utilized a firearm, which reflected a weakness in Violence Against Women Act gun ban enforcement. In this research, regions of the U. S. with less stringent firearm regulations were disproportionately likely to contain IPHS events. Findings illustrate the importance of making distinctions among perpetrators of IPHS, and assessing firearms policies, in order to improve child death prevention efforts. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Child fatality; Domestic violence; Familicide; Murder-suicide","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-79955482428"

The dataset covers the period 2005–2011, when there were large changes in credit volumes, income and consumption in Estonia, a new EU member country. The estimations show that indebtedness measured by the debt-to-income ratio and the debt service ratio hampers consumption over the whole business cycle. The negative impact of the debt service ratio is, however, substantially stronger during the recession than in the pre-crisis and post-crisis periods, while the negative effect of the debt-to-income ratio is relatively stable over the sample period.

Design/methodology/approach: In this paper, an inverted demand function for housing is augmented to include a residential market activity variable and estimate the impact on house prices of the decline in economic activity due to the virus-related measures. The likely future path of house prices based on two different recovery scenarios is also examined. Under both scenarios house prices are forecast to decline in the near term. Findings: The scenario analysis presented here indicates that Irish house prices are set to fall over the next 18 months as a result of the Covid-19 downturn. This contraction in prices is due to the decline in household disposable income and the sharp fall-off in mortgage market activity, which will inevitably result from the administrative closedown implemented by the Irish authorities. Originality/value: As such the approach builds on several studies which have examined both house price movements in general and the relationship between house prices and mortgage credit availability. The paper also draws on the latest analysis of the implications for the Irish economy of Covid-19 and the related administrative closure methods introduced by the public authorities. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Covid-19; Credit; Demand; House prices; Income; Supply","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089957863"

Design/methodology/approach: Using a large-scale survey data on over 30,000 UK small- and medium-sized enterprises between July 2011 and March 2013, the authors estimate a series of conditional probit models to empirically test the determinants of the supply of, and demand for external finance. Findings: Older firms and those with a higher risk rating, and a record of financial delinquency, were more likely to have a demand for external finance. The opposite was true for women-led businesses and firms with positive profits. In general finance was more readily available to older firms post-GFC, but banks were very unwilling to advance money to firms with a high-risk rating or a record of any financial delinquency. It is estimated that a maximum of 42,000 smaller firms were denied credit, which was significantly lower than the peak of 119,000 during the financial crisis. Originality/value: This paper provides timely evidence that adds to the general understanding of what really happens in the market for small business financing three to five years into an economic downturn and in the early post-GFC period, from both a demand and supply perspective. This will enable the authors to consider what the potential impacts of credit rationing on the small business sector are and also identify areas where government action might be appropriate. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Access to finance; Credit rationing; Demand for finance","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84987887285"

Second is, consistent with the social exchange theory, to examine whether psychological contract act as an important mediator for the CE, HPWSs and employees' job attitudes relationships. Empirical evidence was obtained from 424 employees in the Greek manufacturing industry.

Offering models predominantly based on network, efficiency wage and organization theories, this study tests hypotheses using the Taiwan Economic Journal Financial Data Bank to collect data on 436 listed Taiwanese companies from 2005 through 2009 to examine the impacts of three popular downsizing strategies - layoffs, pay cuts and organizational slack reductions - on firm performance. The results indicate that downsizing may not always be the appropriate strategy for improving firm performance because downsizing with layoffs and reduction of organizational slacks may leave the firm at an inappropriate size, thus, negatively affecting firm performance, while downsizing on pay cuts may not negatively affect firm performance, but it may not be an effective strategy to use in the face of an economic downturn.

Although previous research efforts have analyzed factors related to subcontractor performance in regular financial conditions, there remains only sparse knowledge of how subcontractors are to survive when economic conditions become dire, as they have in recent times in the Spanish construction market. In this research, in-depth interviews with managers of relevant Spanish subcontracting companies were carried out, resulting in the identification of eight factors for subcontractor survival: project delivery method, demand, financial capital, relationship assets, managerial assets, human assets, legal framework, and geographic scope. The project delivery method used by the owner and also by the main contractor is mainly based on price. As a result, the subcontractors' bids get lower, making them unsustainable in the long run. Furthermore, subcontractors do not get financial support from banks easily to cover their additional financial costs. These facts push subcontractors to get a guarantee of payment by the main contractor, and subcontracting companies may even ask for payments in advance. Subcontractors also seek long-term relationships with the contractor. These trusting relations are very often a prerequisite to qualify and bid for contracts. Subcontractors have to continuously improve, plan ahead, and adapt quickly to the new environment. Therefore, subcontractors must remain flexible and maintain a lean hierarchical organization. Doing so makes it is easier for subcontractors to compete in both their native markets as well as abroad. To this end, the most successful subcontractors have become international during the expansion phase of the economic cycle; many of them went abroad with the help of a contractor from their home country. © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Construction; Economic crisis; Labor and personnel issues; Spain; Subcontracting; Survival factors","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84894451264"

In particular, young Malaysians, fueled by “outrage and hope” at old oligarchies and lives put on hold by economic, social, and political inequality, were key actors in Bersih rallies staged between 2011 and 2016, driven by social media platforms and networked publics, which enabled the enthusiasm of the streets to connect with and drive the movement’s online formation. In response, the then government began to use media and security laws to disrupt digital networks and engage in arrest of activists and “ordinary” citizens. This, combined with allegations that the government has used astroturfing (commonly referred to as “cybertrooping” in Malaysia) to shape voter sentiments and suppress the momentum of Bersih and popular forms of online political dissent, has been strongly condemned by human rights organizations. This article draws upon findings from PhD research on cybertroopers and ethnographic interviews conducted with 29 Malaysian-Chinese youth between 2016 and 2018 (in Kuala Lumpur and Melbourne, Australia) to map and analyze the effects of the government’s use of “affective techniques” to manipulate social media publics and crackdown on online political communication, with media reports connecting these strategies to declining participation in Bersih’s street rallies from Bersih 4-5. The article will draw on theories of “networked affect” and “affective publics” to examine the role affect has played in this downturn in participation and a growing sense of hopelessness among Malaysia’s digital citizens. © The Author(s) 2019.","networked affect; networked publics; networked social movements; social media politics; state surveillance","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85076512708"

First, based on the value optimization problem of the firm, the authors proposed a theoretical model for firms’ investment decisions, which incorporates the effects of both idiosyncratic (firm specific) and macroeconomic uncertainty/risk. Second, the authors empirically estimate the proposed model for Pakistan. Design/methodology/approach: The authors utilize an unbalanced firm-level panel data covering the period 1988-2013. To generate time-variant firm-specific uncertainty, the authors estimate the autoregressive model on firm sales for each firm included in the sample over the examined period. Firm-specific risk is also measured based on the square of the residuals of firms’ sales. Two measures of macroeconomic uncertainty are computed using the conditional variance obtained by estimating the ARCH model for consumer price index and industrial production index. Several alternative measures of both types of uncertainties are used to ensure the robustness of uncertainty effects. To mitigate the problem of endogeneity, the robust two-step system-generalized method of moments estimator is used to estimate the empirical model. Findings: The results indicate that firms are likely to cut down their level of investment spending when either type of uncertainty increases. The results also reveal that the sensitivity of firms’ investment decisions to macroeconomic (aggregate) uncertainty is higher as compared to the firm-specific uncertainty. The authors show that these findings are robust to different uncertainty measures used in the analysis. The results related to firm characteristics suggest that the firm-specific variables namely the debt to assets ratio, the costs of debt to assets ratio, and the sales to assets ratio are also equally important in the determination of investment decisions of corporate manufacturing firms. Practical implications: The empirical findings of the paper are useful for firm managers, investors, and government authority. Specifically, the results help firm managers and investors to understand how firm-specific and macroeconomic uncertainty affects firms’ investment decisions. The finding that firms cut their investment spending in times of macroeconomic instability implies that declines in firms’ investment spending during the periods of macroeconomic turmoil may delay the process of recovery. Therefore, the policy makers should design such policies that encourage firms to invest more in economic crisis periods, which, in turn, would enhance the growth of the economy and help to overcome the problem of downturn/recession. Originality/value: The authors first propose a theoretical model for firms’ investment decisions based on the value optimization problem of the firm by incorporating the role of both firm-specific and macroeconomic uncertainty. Next, unlike most of previous studies, they estimate the proposed model for non-financial firms operating in Pakistan. The authors predict that a higher exposure to both idiosyncratic and macroeconomic uncertainties leads to lower investment in Pakistani manufacturing firms. Further, the authors hypothesize that both types of uncertainties have differential effects on firms’ investment decisions. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Differential effect; Emerging market; Firm investment; Idiosyncratic uncertainty; Macroeconomic uncertainty; Panel data; Value maximization","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85029819085"

This finding is helpful for speculators in their decision making while taking long and short positions accordingly. This finding suggests that central bank also need to keep other safe haven assets in reserves because the hedging ability of gold is only limited to short run.

The research finds that, prior to the pandemic outbreak in 2020, Saudi Arabia had succeeded in stabilizing production-based CO2 emissions due to a combination of policies outlined in the scope of Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030. However, the economic downturn caused by the pandemic has led to a short-term reduction in CO2 emissions trends, highlighting the need for preparation for a rebound. Driven by the use of analytical methods including the Kaya Identity, this study suggests that the newly proposed circular carbon economy model could be an effective way for the country to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions by coordinating all significant stakeholders, including businesses and government actors. The research analyzes Saudi Arabia’s CO2 emissions trends over the past two decades and presents several steps necessary to achieve social, environmental, and economic outcomes for sustainable businesses operating in a fossil-rich country. We also highlight the need for organizational changes, new policy-making tools, as well as government, consumer, and stakeholder support to drive the changes required for integration of the circular carbon economy model and the adoption of smart technologies.

Based on an analysis of 539 new ventures founded during the years 1991-2001, the following conclusions are reached. First, consistent with prior research, less than half of the 539 ventures survived more than two years. Second, economic downturns lead to higher failure rates for new ventures. Third, new venture success is highly correlated with first-product success.

Recognizing the inevitability of periods of economic stagnation—with another downturn expected as early as 2022, we note that most industry classifications are considered mature and characterized by a few extremely large companies in each industry group. We introduce the Fortune 500 as an important cross-industry collective of these large firms and suggest that they now comprise an institutional field. This development explains their isomorphic behavior during the recession triggered by the financial crisis of 2008 as well as their subsequent motivation for change. Using the pertinent literature from institutional theory and organizational change, we posit that the appropriate firm-level response (strategic choice) during periods of slow growth is to maintain legitimacy and membership in the field by adopting a proactive approach that focuses on improving top-line growth. We synthesize frameworks found in the literature and provide a “menu” of five strategic options companies should consider to turn their firms around by redirecting growth from the short term to the long term. We discuss implications for boards and executives anticipating significant economic deceleration. © 2022 The Authors","CEO succession; Economic stagnation; Institutional field; Strategic choice","CEO succession; Conceptual study; Economic stagnation; Institutional field; Institutional theory; Organizational change; Slow growth; Strategic Behavior; Strategic choice; Uncertainty; financial crisis; growth rate; industrial performance; organizational change; strategic approach; theoretical study; uncertainty analysis; Industrial economics","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135293393"

Most scholars agree there is a positive relationship between companies social and economic performance, however, this is not unanimous. Moreover, during economic downturns, companies struggle for survival and might consider corporate social responsibility efforts should be postponed. This research investigates if there is a positive relationship between social performance and key business results using a large sample of small and medium Portuguese companies over an extended period of time. Design/methodology: The investigation is made by using survey responses from a sample of 2.222 small and medium companies (SMEs) over a 10 year period, from the Portuguese IAPMEI - Public Agency for Competitiveness and Innovation Benchmarking and Good Practices database. The hypothesis that there is a positive relationship between social and key business results performance was tested with correlation analysis and was complemented with semi-structured interviews of key Portuguese Sustainability Managers. Findings: The research results support the existence of valid positive relationships between companies' social performance and key business results, confirming it does pay to invest in corporate social responsibility even in less favorable economic scenarios and for small and medium companies across all business sectors. Research limitations/implications: It was not possible to use more powerful statistical methods such as Partial Least Squares (PLS) or Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) due to data constraints and more qualitative research should be done to triangulate the results and better understating of the cause and effect relationships. Practical implications: Both managers and academics should be aware of the relevance of corporate social responsibility to assure companies enduring success and create benefits for stakeholders and society at large. Originality/value: This research makes contributions for the social and economic relationship body of knowledge with a particular emphasis on small and medium companies in Portugal and a potential application to other similar European countries, by using a large sample basis over an extended period of time.","Corporate social responsibility; Key business results; Portugal; SMEs; Social performance","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84962565072"

This study investigated disturbances to working life and mental health among Americans aged at least 55 during the early months of the pandemic. Methods: Using data from the nationwide COVID-19 Coping Study (N = 6,264), we examined rates of job loss, furloughs, hour/income reductions, and work from home, along with unchanged work status, by age, gender, race/ethnicity, educational attainment, and occupation. We next described sources of worry by job transition group and tested the adjusted associations of COVID-19-related job transitions with life satisfaction, loneliness, depressive symptoms, and anxiety symptoms. Results: Most job losses occurred among respondents younger than age 65 and those without college degrees. Job loss and reduced hours/income were more common among Hispanics compared to other racial/ethnic groups, and work from home transitions were most common among respondents with high educational attainment and jobs in government- and education-related occupations. Workers who lost their jobs had the lowest life satisfaction and the highest loneliness and depressive symptoms, followed by workers who were furloughed and workers with reduced hours/income. Work from home was associated with more anxiety than unchanged work. Discussion: COVID-19-related job transitions are detrimental to mental health, even when they might keep workers safe. These results enhance our understanding of the potentially long-term mental health effects of social and economic aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic and highlight the need for economic and mental health support for aging Americans.  © 2021 The Author(s).

But a large literature has struggled to determine how terrorist threats affect the public's policy preferences. To more credibly estimate the effects of terror threats, we exploit elevations of the U.S. government's color coded alert system. Using this design, a statistical model for texts and a new collection of news stories, we show that media outlets allocate substantially more attention to terrorism after an alert. The alerts have, however, only a limited effect on the public. The terror alerts raise the public's perceived likelihood of a terror attack, but opinion about President Bush's job performance, preferences for foreign intervention, or willingness to restrict civil liberties changes little in response to the alerts. Rather, the only consistent result is decreased economic expectations-consistent with the strong economic downturn after the 9/11 attacks and the types of stories published after the terror alerts are elevated. Terror alerts, then, did not exercise direct influence on the public's policy preferences. Instead the alerts changed the topic of conversation. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84888138621"

Contrary to conventional wisdom that citizens are passive consumers of propaganda, I show that they extract objective economic information from personal experience and local conditions. Moreover, I find that they give greater weight to this information where regional party dominance makes economic performance a clearer indicator of the ruling party's competence and when they believe the media are biased.

The data set includes measures of public opinion, elections, and a broad range of federal legislative decisions important to the business community at large.

The authors analyse the development of this local system in an evolutionary perspective. Empirical data are drawn from a case study of the specialized offshore oil and gas industry town of Verdal in Central Norway. Two exogenous shocks to this local economy and the responses they provoked are pivotal to the analysis. The first shock led to upgrading and diversification effects. The second shock led to the attempted path creation discussed in the article: the initiative to develop Windcluster Mid-Norway (WMN), which was a response to the downturn in the oil and gas industry and simultaneous expectations of growth in the wind-energy sector. The explicit aim was to combine resources from both sectors. The authors argue that new path creation in single-industry regions differs from the related context of 'old industry regions' and that exogenous shocks and external support are necessary elements in the process. © 2014 © 2014 Norwegian Geographical Society.","oil & gas; path creation; single-industry region; wind energy","Nord Trondelag; Norway; Verdal; Verdal; adjustment mechanism; economic reform; industrial district; local economy; structural adjustment; economic analysis; energy resource; gas production; oil production; resource management; wind power","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84896474272"

Following the 2007–08 financial crisis, macroeconomic policy was dominated by austerity as countries attempted to address perceived problems of growing state debt and government budget deficits. This study estimates the impact of austerity on mortality trends for 37 high-income countries between 2000 and 2019. Methods: We fitted a suite of fixed-effects panel regression models to mortality data (period life expectancy, age-standardised mortality rates (ASMRs), age-stratified mortality rates and lifespan variation). Austerity was measured using the Alesina-Ardagna Fiscal Index (AAFI), Cyclically-Adjusted Primary Balance (CAPB), real indexed Government Expenditure, and Public Social Spending as a % of GDP. Sensitivity analyses varied the lag times, and confined the panel to economic downturns and to non-oil-dominated economies. Results: Slower improvements, or deteriorations, in life expectancy and mortality trends were seen in the majority of countries, with the worst trends in England & Wales, Estonia, Iceland, Scotland, Slovenia, and the USA, with generally worse trends for females than males. Austerity was implemented across all countries for at least some time when measured by AAFI and CAPB, and for many countries across all four measures (and particularly after 2010). Austerity adversely impacted life expectancy, ASMR, age-specific mortality and lifespan variation trends when measured with Government Expenditure, Public Social Spending and CAPB, but not with AAFI. However, when the dataset was restricted to periods of economic downturn and in economies not dominated hydrocarbon production, all measures of austerity were found to reduce the rate of mortality improvement. Interpretation: Stalled mortality trends and austerity are widespread phenomena across high-income countries. Austerity is likely to be a cause of stalled mortality trends. Governments should consider alternative economic policy approaches if these harmful population health impacts are to be avoided. © 2022 The Authors","Austerity; Economic growth; Fiscal stimulus; Life expectancy; Mortality; Stalled mortality","Developed Countries; England; Female; Humans; Income; Life Expectancy; Male; Mortality; Scotland; England; Estonia; Iceland; Scotland; Slovenia; United Kingdom; United States; Wales; hydrocarbon; economic growth; financial crisis; financial policy; income distribution; life expectancy; macroeconomics; mortality; panel data; trend analysis; adolescent; adult; Article; child; controlled study; cross-sectional study; economic development; female; healthy life expectancy; high income country; human; infant; male; mortality; mortality rate; newborn; public expenditure; sex difference; developing country; England; income; life expectancy; mortality; Scotland","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85139005088"

Anecdotal evidence suggests that state appropriations are subject to cyclical variation. An analysis of state appropriations to higher education, enrollment in two- and four-year public colleges and universities, and state-specific measures of the business cycle for all 50 states over the period 1969-1994 shows that state appropriations to higher education are highly sensitive to changes in the business cycle. A 1% change in real per capita income was, on average, associated with a 1.39% change in real state appropriations per full-time equivalent student enrolled. This implied decline in state government funding, coupled with the increase in enrollment in higher education during recessions reported by Betts and McFarland (1995), suggest that public institutions of higher education may experience fiscal stress during economic downturns. These results also suggest that state legislators and education policymakers should reconsider their higher education funding policies during recessions in order to allow public colleges and universities to provide dislocated workers with access to quality education and training during these periods.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0034359201"

We examine this relationship by analysing a large sample of publicly listed companies in China for the period of 2009–2019, adopting the peer-firm-average idiosyncratic stock return to capture exogenous variations in peer firms’ investment activities. We demonstrate that peer effects are stronger when EPU is increasing in intensity. We also find that high EPU magnifies peer effects by decreasing the accuracy of firms’ signals regarding their investment opportunities, asymmetrically impacting their capacity to acquire information and exacerbating managers’ career concerns. We further show that increased EPU magnifies peer effects only for underinvesting firms, causing underinvestment to persist and retarding recovery from an economic downturn. Our investigation provides original evidence of how EPU influences corporate investment decisions through peer effects, contributing to the continuing debate on the role of EPU and corporate investment efficiency by establishing that the adoption of consistent and transparent economic policies optimize returns on a company's investments, especially during an economic downturn. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Corporate investment policy; Economic policy uncertainty; Information cascade; Peer effects; Underinvestment","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85110240855"

Design/methodology/approach – The analyses of output, labor income and employment multipliers from the input–output system were performed using the IMPLAN 3.0 software. The study attempted to compare the hotel/motel industry (industry code 411) and the accommodations industry (industry code 412) with the top ten industries and averages of each set of multipliers to estimate the relative importance and contribution of the two hotel industries to the economy of Texas. After this comparison, the aggregated input–output tables and multipliers were prepared to determine the economic inter-relationship between the two combined hotel industries (industry code 411 plus industry code 412) and the non-hotel industries, using the criteria of the NAICS (North American Industry Classification System). Findings – The three findings of this study are summarized as follows. First, the two hotel industries impacted the state economy due to a high induced effect from output and a considerable direct, indirect and induced effect from labor income and employment, despite their relatively lower multipliers and the economic downturn in the state. Second, the hotel-related industry had a strong inter-dependent relationship with the finance and insurance-related industries. Finally, while the hotel industry generated more labor income and employment than did the other accommodations industry, it is interesting that the other accommodations industry created more output than did the hotel industry. Research limitations/implications – Other than limitations pertaining to assumptions of input-output model, an input-output analysis alone cannot become the best analytical method for decision-making. The study was a cross-sectional study with 2009 data and did not incorporate a time-series flow of the state economic structure over several decades. A study of the inter-relationship among varied states bordering the state could be worthwhile to identify the flow of inputs and outputs. Originality/value – Despite a considerable number of research in measuring the economic impacts, this paper was of great significance, in that the economic impact of the hotel industry that has never been performed in a particular state of the USA was analyzed. Additionally, these quantified economic data and results should be helpful to future plans and policies associated with the hotel industry. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Economic impact; Economic structure; Hospitality industry; Hotel industry; Input-output analysis; USA","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84930593049"

Retracing the story of Asia's ""Crisis Five""--Indonesia, Malaysia, South Korea, the Philippines, and Thailand--Padma Desai argues that the region's imprudently fast-paced opening to the free flow of capital was pushed by determined advocates, official and private, in the global economy's U.S.-led developed center. Turmoil ensued in these peripheral economies, the Russian ruble faltered, and Brazil was eventually hit. The inequitable center-periphery relationship also extended to the policy measures that the crisis-swept economies implemented under International Monetary Fund bailouts, which intensified the downturns induced by the panic-driven outflows of short-term capital. Financial Crisis, Contagion, and Containment examines crisis origin and resolution in a comparative perspective by combing empirical evidence from the most robust economies to the least. Why is the U.S. relatively successful at weathering economic ups and downs? Why is Japan stuck in policy paralysis? Why is the European Central Bank unable to achieve both inflation control and stable growth? How can emerging markets avoid turbulence amid free-flowing speculative capital from private lenders of the developed center? Engaging and nontechnical yet deeply insightful, this book appears at a time when the continuing turmoil in Argentina has revived policy debates for avoiding and addressing financial crises in emerging market economies. © 2003 by Princeton University Press.

The tourism industry has been a leading industry in China in its expansion. Foreign investment has played a large role in the expansion of the tourism sector in China and the nature of this investment and its impact are discussed. Very often the economic interdependence of tourism with other sectors of the economy are ignored by policy-makers and in discussion of the tourism industry. In China, lack of attention to these intersectoral interdependencies has resulted in unbalanced investment and economic growth. Investment in the tourism industry in China has tended to be concentrated in the building of hotels for a number of reasons mentioned in the paper. Furthermore, this investment has been dominated by foreign capital and there appears to have been overconcentration on the building of high-class hotels. A top-heavy structure has emerged which is not well-suited to customer demands. In general, the building of hotels appears to have proceeded more on the basis of preconceptions by officials and suppliers than on the basis of market or economic analysis. Thus, the current location and pattern of supply is such as to make many hotels uneconomic. There appears to be a need to re-evaluate policies in relation to the tourism industry in China. The downturn in foreign tourism to China following the political events of June 1989 should provide a stimulus for such re-evaluation. Even before these events, it was clear that tourism growth was significantly tapering off. While this might suggest to some that China is entering a 'mature phase' in the product cycle as far as foreign tourism is concerned, China has many untapped or only peripherally exploited opportunities for expanding foreign tourism. So one should not be pessimistic about the prospects for a substantial increase in foreign tourism to China. © 1991.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-11244353360"

The worldwide economic downturn and slow growth in domestic markets are forcing companies to depend more than ever on overseas trade. SARS emerged in China in November 2002 and has spread to 26 countries. The SARS epidemic has caused the most severe economic crisis in Southeast Asia since the wave of bank failures and currency devaluations that swept the region five years ago. The SARS epidemic has prompted health officials to implement travel advisories and restrictions, in order to defer nonessential travel to regions of Asia with large numbers of SARS cases. They are enforcing quarantine and isolation measures in major cities to try and limit the spread of SARS. The President of the United States has signed an executive order adding SARS to the list of communicable diseases that can be quarantined. A major disruption in China could paralyze just-in-time supply chains and cause an economic crisis for retailers and other businesses worldwide. The SARS epidemic has caused many economists to drastically reduce their economic-growth forecasts for Asia. New infectious diseases, such as SARS, can emerge and easily travel around the globe, infecting less-resilient hosts and mutating because of the influence of viruses and bacteria in their new environment.

Therefore, we create the accessibility model in nine provinces along the Yellow River based on different years, which incorporates urban scale, travel time, and service frequency of HSR, to dynamically analyze the spatial pattern of urban agglomeration. Moreover, we adapt the Difference-in-differences model to explore the impact on the regional and urban economy and population. The results indicate that HSR significantly improves the accessibility level of most cities in the east and south of nine provinces along the Yellow River, showing a significant “corridor effect.” In terms of urban development potential, the spatial distribution pattern of “mass-shaped high-value areas in the east and point-shaped high-value areas in the west” is observed. Furthermore, empirical results show a greater agglomeration rather than diffusion, large cities benefit from HSR with economic promotion, however, HSR causes population loss and economic downturn in small and medium-sized cities.

Although vacant land exists in all cities, the causes and effects of changes in vacant land can differ. Growing cities may have more vacant land than shrinking cities because of large scale annexation. Meanwhile, depopulation and economic downturn may increase the total amount of vacant and abandoned properties. Despite various causes of increase and decrease of vacant land, the ability to predict future vacancy patterns-where future vacant parcels may occur-could be a critical test to set up appropriate development strategies and land use policies, especially in shrinking cities, to manage urban decline and regeneration efforts more wisely. This study compares current and future vacancy patterns of a growing city (Fort Worth, TX, USA) and a shrinking city (Chicago, IL, USA), by employing the Land Transformation Model (LTM) to predict for future vacant lands. This research predicts and produces possible vacancy pattern scenarios by 2020 and deciphers the ranking of determinants of vacant land in each city type. The outcomes of this study indicate that the LTM can be useful for simulating vacancy patterns and the causes of vacancy vary in both growing and shrinking cities.

Researchers investigate cultural traits that may predict a range of cultural conflict behaviors. In addition, anecdotal evidence shows that researchers continue to take up a constructivist approach of identifying the centrality of cultural influence that causes work related conflicts. This study attempts to determine the different types and levels of conflicts within a multicultural workforce by considering various factors such as ethnicity and geographic and lingual diversities within the global context. The scope is to find possible solutions to reduce and/or eliminate group related and, to a certain extent, individual conflicts within the work place, which have become a matter of concern for any international organization. The findings reveal systematic conflicts between and within workgroups and suggest that regardless of type, relationship, and process, conflicts are detrimental to the operation and total outcome. Those conflicts have a negative impact on performance in the production, especially when they escalate. Displays of interpersonal hostility (yelling, name-calling, throwing things at people and making derogatory inferences about others' own cultures) prevent productive work in all groups, which are inefficient and do not seem motivated to complete their tasks. Increased bickering and hostile behaviour inhibits talking about and working on the immediate task. To a certain extent, the situation could be described as a ""toxic working environment."" A key finding reveals through interviews and participative and non-intrusive observations demonstrated that members of these work-groups are psychologically distressed when there are frequent arguments about interpersonal issues. Consequently, the intrinsic problems which escalate over a five year period, together with extrinsic economic problems due to the global economic downturn, cause the company to have high cost of labor and material. With less than expected sales and, operational destruction due to distress about going concern, PTI is put to challenge. Hence, PTI faces a serious test in solving the existing group conflicts. Failure to improve the working relationships could jeopardize the strategic going concern of the company. © 2013, IGI Global.","","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84898250453"

Drawing from behavioral theory and the threat-rigidity hypothesis, the paper explores firm acquisition behavior, in terms of type of acquisitions, before and during the recent economic downturn. Design/methodology/approach: Using data on 385 acquisitions in Italy in the period 2007-2010, the paper tests hypotheses on how organizational slack and acquisition experience influence the likelihood of cross-border and diversifying acquisitions relative to domestic, non-diversifying acquisitions prior to and during the economic downturn. Findings: Results suggest that the availability of financial resources and acquisition experience both have an important influence on acquisition behavior. Firms with greater slack and acquisition experience were more likely to make diversifying and/or cross-border acquisitions, compared to domestic non-diversifying acquisitions, particularly during an economic downturn, than firms with lower levels of slack and acquisition experience. Originality/value: The paper extends behavioral theory and threat-rigidity hypothesis, highlighting their applicability to acquisition behavior across varying economic conditions.

Casino tourism, albeit performing as a major key to local economic growth, is ultimately vulnerable to external shocks to gambling demand, as evidenced by the current sharp downturn in Macao. We find that faster gaming growth leads to higher income inequality while at the same time both factors are responsible for soaring housing bubbles, which constitute the very source of social tensions as in Macao. Casino tourism if not well managed may not be a panacea for all development goals. The implication for policy derived from this study is that Macao must deal with underlying issues rather than apply palliative measures. Its market failures may necessitate government interventions to ensure social equity and sustainable tourism. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Casino tourism; Economic inequality; Housing bubbles; Macao; Unbalanced growth","China; Macau; economic growth; housing market; income distribution; tourism economics; tourism management","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85019098669"

Among a sample of single mothers in Los Angeles and southeast Michigan, we find that when single mothers lose jobs and do not receive cash assistance, they package income from a variety of sources (such as other public assistance programs and informal child support), find others in their social networks to pay their bills, or move in with others. However, their income packaging strategies are fraught with challenges. Benefits from certain public programs are difficult to secure; financial assistance from friends and family members can quickly vanish, particularly if a partner is deported or jailed; and doubling up with others often leads to living in crowded and unsafe conditions. © 2015 Russell Sage Foundation.All right reserved..","Economic survival; Income packaging; Single mothers; Welfare reform","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84978045265"

As suggested by a recent stream of research, the most promising of these ways is for businesses that have retrenched to initiate recovery strategies designed to redirect their remaining resources toward more promising product-market combinations. The choice of this set of alternatives, known as entrepreneurial recovery strategies, is the topic of the research that was undertaken. Entrepreneurial recovery strategies involve reformulation of a firm's products, services, markets, or principal technologies in ways that represent a new or radically altered competitive posture. They are contrasted to efficiency recovery strategies that entail retaining the current product-market-technology orientation but on a smaller and more efficient scale. As these descriptions suggest, the thrust of research on recovery strategies has been to merge the findings from entrepreneurship studies on new venture creation and corporate intrapreneurship with strategic management studies on retrenchment and recovery. Our project extends this process by treating recovery strategies as the central element in a turnaround model. The research was specifically designed to address two research questions: 1. Which functional areas are most emphasized by small market share (SMS) firms that pursue entrepreneurial versus efficiency recovery strategies? 2. What are the performance implications for adopting entrepreneurial versus efficiency recovery strategies for mature-industry, SMS manufacturers based on the cause of the performance downturn? The research questions were investigated through an empirical analysis of 32 companies, each of which controlled less than 1% of their mature manufacturing industry's total sales. Two executives from each of these companies responded to a 162-item questionnaire designed to assess the cause of a downturn that occurred anytime during the period of 1976-1985, any changes in strategy components during the recovery, and the emphasis placed on specific functional level activities during the response to the decline. Additionally, objective measures of performance were used to assess the performance implications of entrepreneurial and efficiency strategies. The major findings from the research included: (1) a high degree of strategy change among the participant firms; (2) a focus on marketing and production functional areas by SMS firms that pursued entrepreneurial recovery strategies, and a focus on finance and management functional areas for SMS firms that pursued efficiency recovery strategies; and (3) a relatively poor level of performance among SMS firms that pursued entrepreneurial recovery strategies. The main implication from the study is that SMS companies in mature manufacturing industries should consider the adoption of efficiency-oriented recovery strategies to foster economic revival. The research should be replicated in industries that vary both technologically and in stage of life cycle to determine if entrepreneurial strategies represent more viable alternatives in certain other turnaround situations or for other industry populations. © 1994.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-38149143687"

Empirical data on FHA insured mortgage foreclosures is then examined to discern the predictive influence of optimal-option-valuation-and-exercise variables on observed default timing and values.

The MMC approach is more efficient and provides superior out-of-sample credit rating migration risk predictions at long horizons than a naïve approach that conditions deterministically on the business cycle phase. Banks using the MMC estimator would counter-cyclically increase capital by 6% during economic expansion and free up to 17% capital for lending during downturns relative to the naïve estimator. Thus, the MMC estimator is well aligned with the Basel III macroprudential initiative to dampen procyclicality by reducing the recession-versus-expansion gap in capital buffers. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Basel III; Credit risk; Default probability; Out-of-sample prediction; Procyclicality; Rating migration; Value-at-risk","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84857921715"

Downturns (upswings) in the oil and gas sector also prompt downturns (upswings) in the non-oil sector as fluctuations in oil revenues affect the government's capacity to subsidize the rest of the economy. Second, oil price innovations also lead to higher inflation in Azerbaijan. In response to the required tightening of monetary policy, the manat appreciates against the US dollar. Finally, GDP effects are primarily seen after oil price increases, whereas the interest rate and the exchange rate mainly react to decreases. Inflation increases after both types of shocks, due to either the accommodative monetary policy stance in the case of oil price decreases or the shock itself in the case of increases. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Azerbaijan; Dutch disease; Natural resources; Oil prices; Vector autoregression","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85091687200"

Several studies have pointed to the generally positive nature of the relationship between the economic and environmental performance of tourism firms. Yet, although business models act as a vector between these aspects of firm performance, they have been overlooked in sustainable tourism discourse. The paper reports findings from discussion groups of SMTE businesses in South West England during the global economic downturn. Environmental costs and cost control were afforded relatively little importance in terms of value creation; conversely, there was a strong and predictable emphasis on revenue generation. Indirect tactics emerged for dealing with guests’ environmental behaviours which reflected this prevailing commercial logic. Green credentials were routinely de-emphasized, sometimes regarded as liabilities, in a form of greenhushing. Responses were framed by reference to social media and how online reviews may negatively impact on future value capture. Conceptually, the business model emerged as an important lens for understanding how environmental resources and costs were valourized. The paper highlights the need to ensure that contemporary approaches to environmental management in SMTEs reflect the current and fast-changing conditions that frame business models. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Business model; consumption; cost; environment; resources; SMTEs","cost analysis; ecotourism; environmental economics; environmental management; industrial performance; small and medium-sized enterprise; tourism economics","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84991465796"

The paper chronicles the changing immigration policy framework, from one premised on exclusion to one designed primarily to serve the needs of the domestic labour market. One of the consequences of the polices, more by default than design, has been the transformation of society from a monocultural to a multicultural one. In spite of this migrants from other than mainly English speaking (MES) countries often have poor labour market outcomes, sometimes well after the time of arrival. This group appears to be more adversely affected by the downturn in economic cycles than other migrants or the Australian-born population.

However the transition from a centralized system of conciliation and arbitration to a more deregulated labour market has compounded the disadvantage suffered by these workers.","Australia; Immigrants; Labour market; Multi-cultural society","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-18544379002"

The influence that she has exerted upon him may have become more marked in recent times, in response to the economic downturn and debt crisis, which has allowed Cameron to be more openly Thatcherite in his language, but he has always tried to follow in at least some of her footsteps. This was because of the dominance of right-wing views in the parliamentary Conservative party, which it has been necessary for Cameron to appease in the interests of party unity, and because he shared Thatcher's scepticism towards the state, seeking to express it in the more voter-friendly concept of social responsibility. © 2010 The Author.

While the relationship has frequently been studied in relation to hard news journalism, less attention has been paid to other beats, especially those which have always had a closer relationship with commercial interests. Focusing on the field of lifestyle journalism, this article presents the results of a survey of more than 600 Australian lifestyle journalists. It examines in detail how these journalists experience working with advertising and PR interests, as well as the provision of free products and services. It finds that lifestyle journalists broadly deny being influenced too much by these pressures, however, regression analysis suggests that, in particular, younger journalists experience more pressure, as do magazine journalists, as well as those working in the areas of travel, fashion and beauty journalism. © 2019 The Author(s).

Propensity to treat individuals justly and costs and constraints that limit just treatment in a layoff situation are discussed at the organizational and managerial levels. A survey of human resource (HR) managers (n = 543) was used to examine predictors of layoff informational justice (e.g., advanced notice, method of informing, and amount of information) and interpersonal justice (e.g., manager demeanor, concerns for sabotage, and escorting layoff victims off the premises). Responses demonstrated more justice in the implementation of layoffs than is suggested from anecdotal ""downsizing horror stories"" found in the popular press. Informational justice dimensions were predicted by both organizational and managerial factors. For example, less advanced notice was provided when the reason for the layoff was exogenous, such as an economic downturn, then when it was endogenous, such as an organizational restructuring. Additionally, although many companies used individual meetings when informing victims of a layoff, group notification was used more as the size of the layoff increased. There was also much variation in layoff implementation that was not readily explainable by organizational and managerial factors, particularly with regard to interpersonal justice. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

Design/methodology/approach - The article focuses on preliminary statistics and anecdotal evidence from library communities in the UK and the USA. Findings - Early evidence suggests that public library usage rises as the economy declines. Public library authorities in the UK and USA have reported huge increases in visitor numbers, shifts in societal expectations, and demands for specific ""job related"" resources and services. Although public libraries have emerged as vital services in times of recession it is perceived that they will be subject to ongoing review over the next few years as governments and local councils attempt to cut public spending. Research limitations/implications - At the time of writing very little official research had been conducted to investigate the impact of this latest recession on public library usage. Therefore, the findings are based on early statistical and anecdotal evidence, available via websites, forums and blogs. Practical implications - This article presents a case for public libraries as essential services with the potential to empower, educate, transform and inspire individuals and communities in times of crisis. It should be of interest to those working in public libraries and those documenting their impact. Originality/value - This article represents an attempt to document the role of public libraries in the early stages of a major global recession. It highlights that although the latest economic downturn has created many opportunities for public libraries there is an urgent need to address the great many risks that public libraries will inevitably face as a result of this recession. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Public libraries; Recession; Social values; United Kingdom; United States of America","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-68049132999"

Our understanding of this trend and its determinants is so far built only on a corpus of small-N evidence, while systematic comparative large-N analyses are lacking. As a result, the broad patterns of policy change and their general political drivers remain underexplored. This paper fills this gap by examining unemployment benefit sanction reforms in 20 democracies between 1980 and 2012 using an original dataset. It is shown that governments introduce tougher sanctions in order to reconcile two competing pressures that arise during economic downturns: an increased need for social protection and reduced fiscal revenues. The findings, which are also applicable to other historical periods and policy areas, provide an impulse for future comparative large-N research on 'demanding activation' policies. © Cambridge University Press 2018.","","economic conditions; future prospect; labor market; labor policy; research; social policy; social security; unemployment","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85057620524"

This leads to considerable variation across place and space. Yet within this diversity commonalities emerge, not least in the ‘rationales’ that inform the development and implementation of land policies. These are explored via a comparative study of England – where market-based reforms have guided land use planning measures for some time – and The Netherlands; a country which is taking steps to introduce market-based values such as competition, efficiency and flexibility into its ‘regulatory’ spatial planning system. Through this comparison, we explore the way in which neoliberal political ideology and financial imperatives, sharpened by the 2008 global economic downturn, have resulted in changes to English and Dutch land policies. We illustrate this discussion by referring to land use policies under which authorities have sought to facilitate a change of land use, for example from office to residential usages. In both countries, these reforms have been introduced as part of attempts to make planning more ‘efficient’ and supportive of real estate markets. While there is variation in some of the drivers and apparatus used, we find parallels between the two countries’ experiences. Our paper argues that fiscal austerity, economic uncertainty and the import of market values reproduces a shared reality of governance reform amongst the two countries, creating opportunities for critical learning between them. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Governance; Land policy; Permitted development rights; Planning reforms","England; Netherlands; United Kingdom; comparative study; governance approach; institutional framework; land rights; land use planning; policy approach; reform process; spatial planning","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85008193432"

Theoretical justifications exist for superior performance for both types of strategic orientations, but we argue each orientation will have different implications on firms' long-term survival in emerging markets. The growth-oriented strategy faces a shortage of non-scale free resources that would limit the firm's long-term survival, while the profit-oriented strategy would improve the chance of long-term survival by developing and leveraging firm-specific advantages for sustained growth. The study also examines the moderating effects of both the level of non-scale free resources and the extent to which the economic context favors growth. The empirical testing utilizes a sample of Chinese firms during 2008–2017. Managerial summary: Emerging markets present many growth opportunities. Firms often fall into the trap of blindly pursuing these opportunities without considering internal managerial capability. This study presents the theory-based logic and empirical evidence supporting the view that the profit-oriented strategy is likely to outperform the growth-oriented strategy on a long-term basis. The growth orientation strains managerial attention that is in short supplies in emerging markets and leads to inefficiencies that cause a decline in firm performance. These results are more apparent when firms lack managerial capability and in the context of growth-inducing economic policy during an economic downturn. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","emerging markets; firm survival; growth-oriented strategy; non-scale free resources; profit-oriented strategy","Commerce; Managers; Economic downturn; Economic policies; Empirical testing; Growth opportunities; Growth orientations; Long term performance; Moderating effect; Strategic orientation; Profitability","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85087863988"

Lack of landfill capacity and a growing scarcity of natural resources have lead to severe ELV reuse and recovery targets in the European Union (EU). This paper examines the main influencing parameters affecting the amount and composition of ELV waste originating from passenger cars to be treated in Authorized Treatment Facilities (ATFs). Moreover the effect of a changing number, composition and life span of passenger cars on the ability to meet the ambitious EU ELV Directive 2000/53/EC targets in 2015 is examined for Belgium. Using system dynamics, the aforementioned changing parameters are studied from 1990 and projected to 2030. The model results show that the total annual weight of ELV waste to be reused and recycled in Belgium is expected to grow over the coming years despite the economic downturn of 2008 and its effect on GDP growth. Moreover it shows that Belgium can sustainably achieve the ambitious EU ELV Directive 2000/53/EC targets in 2015 and thereafter if it continues to invest in waste treatment of ELV plastics. The availability of higher amounts of ELV plastics proves to be favourable to trigger investments in their reusing and recycling. We demonstrate that this can be realized by reducing export of discarded passenger cars, shortening the life span of passenger cars or shortening the time for investing in additional plastic recovery. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Case study Belgium; End-of-life vehicles; Sustainability; System dynamics modelling; Waste management","Belgium; Automobiles; Economic and social effects; Elastomers; Natural resources; Plastic recycling; Sustainable development; System theory; Waste management; Waste treatment; Belgium; Changing parameter; Economic downturn; End-of-Life Vehicles; Influencing parameters; System dynamics approach; System dynamics modelling; Worldwide production; car use; European Union; numerical model; plastic; recycling; sustainability; waste management; waste treatment; Solid wastes","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84989903204"

An attempt is made to study the volatility of stock returns in this paper. The authors studied the impact of global crisis on volatility of stock returns; that can help in better policy selection and implementation in the scenario of financial downturn. Looking at the increase in volume of trades between Asia and the world, Asian markets have gained prime position within global financial industry. Thus, it is essential that more researches are employed for better understanding of Asian Markets. Design/methodology/approach – Impact on volatility of stock market returns of Hong Kong, Japan, China and India during sub-prime crisis and Eurozone debt crisis has been estimated using Exponential Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (EGARCH) model. The analysis is done using time series data of daily returns for the period 2005-2011 of the major indices of these countries (Hang Seng, Nikkei 225, Shanghai Composite and Nifty for Hong Kong, Japan, China and India, respectively). These series show non-normality, thick tails and high persistence in volatility and clustering and asymmetric properties. Findings – It has been found that the sub-prime crisis had a positive impact on the volatility of returns of Japan, China and India while it had no impact on the volatility of returns of Hong Kong. In addition, it is interesting to see that the period of Eurozone debt crisis has had a negative impact on the volatility of already highly volatile stock returns of countries such as India and China. However, no impact on volatility of stock market returns in Japan and Hong Kong was observed of the Eurozone crisis. Also the authors noticed volatility clustering, persistence, asymmetry and leverage effects’ in stock returns series of Hong Kong, Japan, China and India. Research limitations/implications – As far as limitations of the paper are concerned, the economy per say always has a cyclic tendency. This again has scope for distorting the final result and as again the reason given above the authors think that the effect will be minimized. As the paper is using specific statistical methods to verify the model and so the basic limitations of the statistical methods used will apply to the model also. Practical implications – The results could be used in better understanding of the nature of sub-prime crisis and Eurozone debt crisis and how they impact different stock markets of Asia. Better policies during different scenarios of crisis could be employed by the countries. Furthermore, it can also prove useful in minimizing the impact on Asian markets from economic crisis in future. Originality/value – The research is first to indicate the relationship between global crisis and sudden changes in variance of stock returns in Asian markets. The paper attempts to fill the gap of research in this area and also suggests the difference in nature of crisis and how they can affect certain countries. Further research could be done in studying suitable policy measures that can be implemented during different kinds of global crisis. © 2013, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","EGARCH model; Eurozone debt crisis; Stock market; Sub-prime crisis; Volatility","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84955511751"

While the existence of significant differences between men and women is proven (e.g., in terms of risk-taking, propensity towards investments, innovation, development and growth), business strategy studies do not consider the gender of the entrepreneur and do not take into account whether male and female businesses can opt for different solutions when they are faced with an economic crisis. This paper focuses on this topic and it aims to analyze how Italian micro-entrepreneurs have responded to the economic crisis. Moreover it aims to compare male and female entrepreneurs' strategic behavior, in order to understand if they have adopted similar or different strategies when facing the recession. The empirical research is based on a questionnaire survey involving a sample of 300 sole proprietors - 150 men and 150 women-owners of Italian micro-enterprises. Data gathered through the questionnaire has been used to identify the most frequent actions undertaken by entrepreneurs in facing the crisis. Answers supplied by the entrepreneurs were also submitted to factor and cluster analysis in order to identify several typical strategic profiles adopted by entrepreneurs. Four main strategic profiles were identified: training of staff, market-orientation, development and growth, downsizing. Women mainly dealt with the crisis with a defensive attitude and preferred downsizing their activities and increasing efficiency. The main limitation of the research concerns samples compositions, as it only includes sole proprietors located in a limited geographical context. Moreover, the analysis only considers gender issue and ignores other variables (firms' features and/or entrepreneurs' characteristics) that may have influenced businesses' strategies. Data from this investigation contribute to the debate on gender-based differences in behaviors, attitudes and preferences. Until now, no analyzes were carried out to compare the behavior of entrepreneurs of both genders in situations of economic recession.","Economic crisis; Female entrepreneurship; Gender; Italy; Micro-entrepreneurs; Strategies; Women","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84949776019"

To investigate the macroeconomic dimensions of gross credit flows, the paper studies the cyclical behaviour of aggregate credit flows and documents three key cyclical facts. First, excess credit reallocation is countercyclical: for any given rate of change of net credit, gross flows are larger in a recession than in a boom. Second, gross credit flows are highly volatile, with a cyclical volatility which appears more than an order of magnitude larger than GDP volatility. Third, credit contraction is more volatile than credit expansion. Furthermore, the behaviour of gross flows over the 1991 recession suggests that persistent and historically high credit contraction is a key feature of the relatively mild cyclical downturn. The results lend some support to aggregate models that emphasize the asymmetric behaviour of credit expansion and credit contractions. © 2005 The Review of Economic Studies Limited.","","North America; United States; Western Hemisphere; World; banking; capital flow; credit provision","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-22144491506"

This is in contrast to previous studies which have taken into account only parts of banks' assets, and also neglected the potential cyclicality of bank capital. We apply a detailed data set covering a relatively long period to analyse the cyclicality of both bank capital and Basel II capital requirements. Moreover, we employ a more comprehensive system of models than applied in the existing literature. Consistent with previous evidence, we find a substantial increase in the calculated Basel II capital requirements at the same time as bank capital deteriorates in a recession scenario.

Over a sample period from 1988 to 2007, we find that asset correlations are positively related to firm size, but negatively related to firm default probability. Asset correlations are also industry specific, as firms in media, transportation, pharmaceutical, and semiconductor industries exhibit higher asset correlations than those in retail and consumer staples. Most importantly, asset correlations are asymmetric and have a procyclical impact on the real economy after controlling for these effects. They tend to rise during economic downturns, but decline during economic upturns. The average magnitude of the rise is larger than that of the decline. These findings suggest that asset correlations may be underestimated during economic downturns, and may provide policy implications for the capital requirement framework. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Asset correlation; Basel accord; Default probability; Procyclicality; Size effect","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-79960898601"

Although Spain was one of the countries hardest hit by the economic downturn, the crisis was unevenly felt across the country. Therefore, we exploit this difference in unemployment rates across provinces to identify the effects of business cycle variations on the consumption of legal and illegal drugs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to find a relation between the deterioration of local economic conditions and a strong increase in the consumption of marihuana and cocaine. We also report a decrease in alcohol consumption but a significant escalation in abusive smoking behavior (smoking every day).

They favoured using the accrual-based rather than the real activity-based earnings management technique. We also find that firms engaged more in income-increasing practices in the shadow of the outbreak. In addition, our results further demonstrate that financially distressed firms were involved in earnings management, particularly accrual-based earnings management.

Design/methodology/approach – The logistic regression analysis used in this paper is geared towards developing a model that can predict financial distress amongst public listed companies in Malaysia. Findings – The results prove that five financial ratios have been found to be significant and useful for corporate failure prediction in Malaysia. The overall predictive accuracy is 91.5 percent and this demonstrates that the logistic regression analysis used is a reliable technique for financial distress prediction. In addition, the predictive accuracy of the model in this paper is higher than that of previous studies, which utilised discriminant analysis rather than the method adopted in this research. Originality/value – The economic crisis mostly began to affect Malaysia's economic standing in July 1997 causing many companies to fall into financial distress, as they were unable to cope with the unexpected downturn. A financial distress prediction model is therefore required to act as a predictor of Malaysian public listed companies' well-being prior to a financial crisis and to gauge the warning signals of the onset of a downturn in order to strategize their survival techniques during this phase.

Ireland appears to be well suited to study the impact of the recession on intra-European migration. The country has not only experienced large-scale inward migration from the new EU Member states (NMS) in recent years, but has also been severely hit by a recession. At times of an economic crisis, questions have begun to be asked about the future intentions of migrants. By drawing on an ongoing Qualitative Panel Study on the experience of Polish migrants in the Irish labour market, we argue that simplistic assumptions about migrants leaving the country 'when times are getting tough' are misplaced. No doubt some NMS migrants will leave because of the worsening economic situation and new opportunities elsewhere. As East-West migration has adopted a more temporary and circular character facilitated by a free movement regime, NMS migrants have the opportunity to move on elsewhere at times of a downturn. At the same time, many Polish migrants are 'here to stay', for the moment at least. This is for at least three reasons. A clear majority of NMS migrants remains in employment, in spite of the downturn. Furthermore, even if migrants should lose their jobs, welfare state arrangements in the host country offer some protection against destitution. Moreover, the decision to migrate, and consequently to stay or move on, is not just reached on the basis of economic considerations alone. Particularly social networks are of importance in sustaining the migration process relatively independent from short-term economic change, including an economic downturn. © Sociological Research Online, 1996-2009.","East-West migration; Free movement; Ireland; Poland; Recession","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-67650716932"

Using Harvey's ideas about capitalist crises and capital switching, along with conceptions of crisis dynamics in peripheral societies based in the works of economic geographers and dependent development theorists, I argue that the crisis in Thailand was a fully economic crisis involving all circuits of the economy, linking domestic and international accumulation processes, and stemming in part from struggles over appropriation of the surplus. In order to demonstrate this, I analyze the crisis in Thailand at both national and international scales and show that it was rooted in declining profitability of manufacturing in a context of increased global export competition and overcapacity. This context created the strong likelihood of economic downturn throughout the region, with Thailand falling first because of its specific liabilities, and other countries being pulled into the maelstrom of devaluation through financial contagion effects.","Asia; Economic crisis; Marxian crisis theory; Thailand","Thailand; financial crisis; Marxism; national economy; profitability","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0034956741"

Antarctic tourism has rapidly grown since 1991 and is currently picking up again after the recent global economic downturn. Tourism activities are subject to the rules of the Antarctic Treaty System (ATS) and the decisions made by the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties (ATCPs), but within this context, the industry has considerable freedom to self-organise. The industry is self-regulated by a voluntary member-based group, the International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO). Researchers and policy-makers express concern about IAATO's ability to deal with further tourism development and the environmental consequences. This study applies a new approach to understand what affects self-regulation, consisting of a literature review and agent-based modelling (ABM). The review identifies four challenges for self-regulation: operator commitment, tourism growth, operator diversification, and accidents. The ABM simulations help conceptualise the complex concepts and theories surrounding self-regulation. Self-regulation is measured by the capacity of the simulated self-regulatory system to maintain a majority membership at the end of 20 years. The model suggests that a number of the challenges are nonlinear and have tipping points. This approach provides insights that industry officials and policy-makers can use to proactively regulate Antarctic tourism. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.","agent-based modelling (ABM); Antarctic tourism; IAATO; scenario analysis; self-regulation; simulation","Antarctica; ecotourism; modeling; regulatory approach; tourism development; tourism management","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84960233882"

More striking, we find negative wage and employment effects for high-skilled workers who are further up the wage distribution, followed by reduced returns to skills and industry skill supply. We explain these adjustments with a substitution-scale model that predicts negative spillover effects whenever labor-labor substitutions toward high-skilled workers are overcompensated by an overall decline in industry employment.

The accumulation of net worth of intermediaries is slow relative to that of the corporate sector.

However, this conclusion is largely based on data from a period in which inequality was increasing over time. This paper examines the connection between long-run trends and cyclical variation in earnings inequality. We develop a model in which cyclical and trend inequality are related, and find that in our model, recessions tend to amplify long-run trends, i.e. they involve more rapidly increasing inequality when long-run inequality is increasing, and more rapidly decreasing inequality when long-run inequality is decreasing. In support of this prediction, we present evidence that during the first half of the 20th century, when earnings inequality was generally declining, earnings disparities indeed appeared to fall more rapidly in downturns, at least among workers at the top of the earnings distribution. © 2004 Elservier B.V.

Sales grew a remarkable 350% from $60 million in 2002 to $210 million in 2007 and did not begin to decline until the beginning of the recent economic downturn beginning in late 2008. No published research is yet able to account for this phenomenon in a manner that is both socially-situated and medium-specific. In this paper, I provide such a sociological account of the rise of manga in the United States and its implications for the globalization of culture. Adapting Pierre Bourdieu's theoretical formulation of the cultural field, I argue that manga migrated from the comics field to the book field and that the ways in which industry practices, distribution networks, and target demographics differ between the two fields are directly responsible for the medium's newfound visibility. Furthermore, I argue that, despite the now-common transparency of the Japanese origin of Japanese titles, the American publishing industry's creation of manga as a category of books distinct from other comics is an ineluctable naturalizing process that ultimately erases from American consciousness the Japanese, the foreign, the other. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","American publishing; Comics; Field theory; Globalization; Graphic novels; Japan; Manga","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-79957879216"

When economic recession hit Sweden in the beginning of the 1990s, a period of half a century of continuous expansion and reforms in the welfare sector came to an end. The economic downturn enforced rationing measures in most welfare programs and was accompanied by a move towards privatisation of local welfare services and an endeavour to initiate market incentives in the care-giving systems. The focus was increasingly directed on welfare as a financial burden, and the issue of how diminishing resources should be allocated ranked high on the political agenda. In this article we depart from the concept of solidarity and discuss the development of Swedish welfare and welfare opinion. First, we articulate various representations of the concept of solidarity - societal cohesion, individual support for comprehensive welfare and the amount of universality in the provision of care. Second, we describe some fundamental traits in the route taken by Swedish welfare during the 1990s, focusing especially on care of elderly and the demographic challenge of an ageing population. Third, we summarise the evolution of public opinion regarding welfare provision and discuss the determinants of its variations. The article concludes with a discussion of how the (once salient) features of universalism have been affected by the development during the past decade, and the role of popular support in the route ahead for Swedish welfare.","Care of elderly; Solidarity; Swedish welfare; Universalism; Welfare transition","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0042546559"

We find that an increase in public investment has a strong positive effect on output, employment, wages and consumption during periods of economic downturn. Deficit-financed public investment does not increase the debt-to-GDP ratio and is essentially self-financed. In contrast, an increase in public consumption has little impact on economic activity and increases the debt-to-GDP ratio. The observed short term effects concur with a neo-Keynesian pattern suggesting that increase in public investment boosts the demand for labor in the private sector, leading to higher real wages and higher consumption. In the medium term, an increase in public investment enhances private investment thus generating supply side effect. We conclude that public investment can be an important policy instrument for combatting recessions and stimulating long-run growth, since monetary policy has run out of steam. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Emerging EU economies; Fiscal multipliers; Keynesian vs. neoclassical view of fiscal policy; Public investment; Stabilisation policy","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85079423376"

To achieve CO2 reduction and pollution reduction in China, the trend and causes of decoupling both CO2 and SO2 from economic growth were evaluated. Then, the synergistic effect of two decoupling indices was investigated by spatial econometric model, i.e., Geographically and Temporally Weighted Regression (GTWR). The analysis results show that: (1) Per capita GDP and energy intensity were the main positive contribution and negative contribution, severally. (2) There have been variations within the ranking of the sensitivity of two decoupling indices to each influencing factor. Emission coefficients, energy mix and energy intensity are highly sensitive in most regions. For decoupling index of CO2, the sensitivity was higher in eastern regions, however, the sensitivity of decoupling index of SO2 was the contrary. (3) There was spatial and temporal heterogeneity within the synergistic effect. The effect in the western region is higher than that in the eastern region, different from economic development, especially in Xinjiang province, where increasing the decoupling effort of CO2 by 1 unit can reduce the decoupling index of SO2 by 0.50 in 2018. (4) According to the trend of the synergistic effect, six sectors could be defined, where sector “e” should be the focus of attention, with an average coefficient of −0.33. After 2016, the effect in sector “d”, sector “e” and sector “f” tends to increase.

Older people may be particularly vulnerable to economic fluctuations as they are reliant on fixed incomes and assets, which are reducing in value. Within the literature, little is understood about the impact of the current economic downturn on people's general quality of life and well-being and, in particular, there is little research on the financial experiences and capability of the older age group, a concern in light of the ageing UK population. This article reports a qualitative research study into the nature of older peoples' vulnerability by exploring their perceptions of the impact of the economic recession on their well-being and quality of life. It explores specifically a group of older people who are not the poorest within the ageing population, but who may be described as the 'asset rich-income poor' group. Key themes relate to the impact of the recession on the costs of essential and non-essential items and dimensions of mental, physical and social well-being. Implications for health and social care practice in meeting the needs of older people during times of economic recession are then explored. The paper adds to the debate by demonstrating that the recession is having adverse consequences for older people's quality of life in terms of economic, mental and social well-being, although there is also evidence that some of them are equipped with certain resilience factors due to their money management and budgeting skills. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Economic downturn; Older people; Resilience factors; Well-being","Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Economic Recession; Female; Great Britain; Humans; Male; Personal Satisfaction; Qualitative Research; Quality of Life; Resilience, Psychological; aged; article; coping behavior; economic recession; female; human; male; qualitative research; quality of life; satisfaction; United Kingdom","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84867640034"

But contrary to some of the hypotheses, the other innovation dimensions have no significant differences, although most results indicate that family firms systematically and generally reduce their innovation more than NFFs. Originality&sol;valueThis research contains two original features. First, the authors have been able to analyse the change in innovation behaviour of a comparable set of FFs and NFFs. The second relevant feature is the analysis of the specific interaction of FFs&rsquo; differential traits with the different types of innovation. The availability of detailed empirical data on innovation adoption enabled this study and is also one of its contributions. This research has also value since the results can be read as a challenge to existing approaches on the preferences and nature of FFs that have either a positive or negative effect on innovation. © 2012, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Economic recession; Family business; Family firms; Innovation; Spain","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84924435234"

The purpose of this paper is, therefore, to appraise the survival strategies of organisations within the built environment, with a view to showcasing these strategies to ensure continuous survival of organisations within the industry. Design/methodology/approach: The study adopted a survey approach, and construction professionals across the six geo-political zones of the country were sampled using structured questionnaire. Data gathered were analysed using percentage, Kruskal–Wallis H-test and factor analysis. Findings: The study revealed that organisation- and workforce management-related strategies are the most adopted survival strategies in the country, as they have the highest factor loading and accounts for about 37 per cent of the total extracted factors. This is followed by the adoption of strategies relating to organisation’s innovation, diversification, financial management and organisation’s networking, the combination of which accounts for 27.5 per cent of all extracted factors. Research limitations/implications: Findings of this study imply that although organisations within the built environment see the need for effective management of their organisation and workforce in a bid to survive in the harsh economic situation of the country, more need to be done as regards the other identified survival strategies, as they can help ensure the survival of these organisations.

Design/methodology/approach - The paper examines recession-specific strategies designed to drive growth and ensure that a company survives. Findings - Even after the eventual economic recovery, heightened uncertainty and volatility will remain permanent features of the business environment. As a result, resilience - the ongoing ability to anticipate and adapt to critical strategic shifts - will become an increasingly important driver of future competitive advantage. Given the likelihood that the strategic environment will remain uncertain even after the recovery, the company must institutionalize the lessons learned during the downturn. And go further to adjust the customer offering and business practices (new services, new features, new pricing models, enter or exit markets, band with other businesses in cooperative relationships). Practical implications - The consensus is growing among economists, business leaders, and governments that the world is in the midst of a prolonged slowdown of unpredictable duration and that even when the upturn comes, the post-crisis strategic and operating environment will almost certainly be quite different.

This followed a series of restrictive legislative measures adopted by Irish governments throughout the 1920s which sought to limit women's participation in public life and the public sector. Such a requirement emerged in several countries in response to high unemployment and applied principally to women's white-collar occupations, leading some commentators to argue that it stemmed from a social consensus rather than an economic rationale. Despite opposition to the ban from the Irish National Teachers' Organisation (INTO) on the basis that it was unconstitutional, would lead to fewer marriages and that married women were in fact more suited to teaching children, it remained in place until 1958. Although the ban is much referred to as part of the gender ideology that informed legislation in the early years of independent Ireland, the particular history of married women teachers has been little researched in the academic context. Over 50 years since the rescinding of the ban, this article examines its impact through an analysis of primary sources, including government cabinet minutes and the public commentary of the INTO and positions this history within the international context. © 2010 Stichting Paedagogica Historica.","Marriage ban; Primary schools; Teaching; Women","Cultural Characteristics; Employment; History, 20th Century; Ireland; Marriage; Single Person; Social Change; Social Control Policies; Teaching; Women's Health; Women's Rights; Women, Working; article; cultural factor; economics; education; employment; ethnology; family size; female; history; Ireland; legal aspect; marriage; psychological aspect; social change; social control; teaching; women's health; women's rights","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-77957884290"

In the PT literature, we find evidence about what drives users’ satisfaction. Still, past studies have utilised data that has been mostly retrieved from user surveys during periods where the network and its services were quite stable, or during an economic downturn, in contrast to facing a structural network transformation. Barcelona public bus company (TMB) reformed into a transfer based-network, the NXB (Nova Xarxa de Bus) since 2012. This reform allows discerning which operative, travel, and sociodemographic characteristics affect the users’ satisfaction and their priorities, during a major network reform. We use a three-year customer satisfaction survey (n = 12,511), for our study. Employing a structural equation (SEM) approach, with both numeric and ordinal Probit models, we assess whether critical variables from the bus network reform affect users’ satisfaction significantly. Following a two step-approach, initially an SEM-MIMIC model for the whole population, then a Multi-Group Analysis (MGA), we appraise for different satisfaction models across subpopulations. We propose a reflective latent variable to measure the socioeconomic status (SES), which resulted in significant and negative estimates towards satisfaction, as expected, in all models. Our most important result confirms that users value reliability over other latent satisfaction constructs. Besides the satisfaction constructs, users give an additional relevance to the NXB lines, indicating that intrinsically the users perceive added-value from these lines. Most of the transfers between buses and other transport modes do not affect bus-users satisfaction. Our results imply that efficiently designed transfer-based networks may be a suitable solution from users’ perspective. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Multiannual customer surveys; Network reform; Ordinal Probit; Public transport; SEM-MGA; SEM-MIMIC","Buses; Digital storage; Metadata; Surveys; Customer satisfaction survey; Customer surveys; Ordinal Probit; Public transport; Socio-demographic characteristics; Socioeconomic status; Structural equations; Structural networks; annual variation; network analysis; perception; public transport; socioeconomic status; survey method; transportation mode; Customer satisfaction","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85064271338"

Under this theory, the share of productivity-enhancing activities (PEAs), such as R&D investment or on-the-job training, relative to production activities should increase during downturns because of the fall in their relative cost - in terms of forgone output. This would imply that business cycles may have a (positive) long-term impact on firms' productivity growth. In the spirit of Aghion et al. (2008), we allow the impact of the cycle on PEA to vary between firms with different access to external funding. We find that, in accordance with the opportunity-cost approach, the share of R&D investment and training expenditures on total investment outlays follow a countercyclical pattern, which in the case of R&D may be reversed by the presence of credit constraints. However, the share of investment in other non-R&D-related intangible investments is found to be acyclical, which could suggest some kind of substitution across different PEAs over the cycle. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","business cycle; credit constraints; on-the-job training; panel data; R&D","Spain; Pisum sativum; business cycle; economic activity; firm size; industrial investment; panel data; productivity; research and development","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84887997127"

Space flight is undoubtedly a human achievement of the second half of the 20th century, and probably the most audacious one of the past century. The space race started suddenly in the 1950s and has grown explosively during the following two decades, but decreased steadily after the 1970s. After the 1990s, however, we have seen a shy rebirth of space-related activities, when many other actors (states) entered the stage, adding up to the agonizing role of the two-actor piece that we have witnessed during the so-called Cold War. The opening years of the 21st century provided a more complex narrative for space exploration. At the start of the new millennium a new technosphere [1] emerged, dominated by what is used to be called as the Information and Communications Technologies (ICT), with the Internet playing the leading role among the bandwagon of technological novelties that appeared during the twilight of space activities. In despite of the fact that artificial satellites represent the very backbone of the global communications system, space activities seem to play a secondary role amidst the apparently accelerated rate of change concerning the technological systems of the present technosphere. But, as it is demonstrated in this paper, things are changing, and very probably a renewed space race will unfold in the coming decades. A question may be placed: what happened? Why the Earth stood still with regard to the race toward the cosmos? Answer: futurists, even prestigious ones like Herman Kahn and Arthur Clarke, did not consider the existence of socioeconomic long waves (Kondratieff waves, or K-waves for short) with their two decades long economic downturn, which has contributed to the deceleration of space-related activities. Analyzing the worldwide evolving scenario of space-related activities during the last eighty years under the framework of the succeeding K-waves and applying some technological forecasting tools, namely the logistic analysis, technological surveillance and intensive data mining, scrutinizing more than 7500 events occurred in the period 1930-2010 related with space activities, it is demonstrated that the space race like the one that we have witnessed until now is a natural growth process that has saturated at the dawn of this century.

In this paper, we verify empirically the interrelations between waves of optimism and pessimism and subsequent economic fluctuations. We focus on the behavior of nonfundamental movements in the consumer sentiment index, as a proxy, for consumers' sunspots, and in the business formation index, representing investors' animal spirits, around economic turning points. We find that bearish consumers and entrepreneurs were present before the onset of some U.S. economic downturns, sometimes even when the fundamentals were all very strong. In particular, our analysis shows that self-fulfilling pessimism may have played a nontrivial role in the 1969-1970, the 1973-1975, and the 1981-1982 recessions. The results are robust to a range of alternative linear and nonlinear specifications.

Encompassing 17-23 Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries, the analysis calls into question the idea of a general retreat from fiscal policy activism since the early 1980s. The propensity of governments to respond to economic downturns by engaging in fiscal stimulus has increased over time and no secular trend in the size of stimulus measures is observed. At the same time, OECD governments have relied more on tax cuts to stimulate demand in the two recessions of the 2000s than they did in the early 1980s or early 1990s. Regarding government partisanship, no significant direct partisan effects on either the size or the composition of fiscal stimulus is found for any of the four recession episodes. However, the size of the welfare state conditioned the impact of government partisanship in the two recessions of the 2000s, with left-leaning governments distinctly more prone to engaging in discretionary fiscal stimulus and/or spending increases in large welfare states, but not in small welfare states. © 2014 European Consortium for Political Research.","Business cycle; Fiscal policy; Government partisanship; Welfare state","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84920270853"

These findings are consistent with investors placing a positive value on the probability that negative accruals increase the likelihood that concessions can be extracted from lenders during renegotiation.

In this paper we extend the standard business cycle analysis to the underground economy and compare it to the legitimate economy. Using National Bureau of Economic Research dating methodologies we find that classical cycles exhibit strong incidence of asymmetry while growth cycles appear relatively symmetric. We find that changes in legitimate activity lead to changes in underground activity but that the underground economy responds more to negative shocks in legitimate activity than to positive shocks. This implies that the underground economy is deepening economic downturns and increasing the volatility of the business cycle in general.","","Australia; black market; business cycle; economic activity; national economy; parallel economy","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-12844258242"

The evidence shows that under NAFTA Mexican trade and foreign direct investment inflows have risen at rapid rates, particularly in the export-oriented assembly-line sector. However, the evidence also suggests that it is hard to disentangle the effects of NAFTA from the other non-NAFTA factors such as demand in the U.S. in explaining the dynamism of the Mexican export sector (and economy). This has been attested by how the Mexican economy has been dragged into a severe recession over the past two years as a result of the relatively mild downturn in the U.S. business cycle. Insofar as employment growth, real wages in manufacturing, and productivity performance is concerned, the evidence presented indicates that the record has been lackluster at best and disastrous at worst. Manufacturing employment fell dramatically after the peso crisis, and remains stagnant. Real wages have plunged since the peso crisis and have yet to recover levels attained in the mid-1980s. In terms of productivity performance, no strong conclusions can be reached given the conflicting estimates in the extant literature. At best, the data show that productivity rose at healthy rates in the tradeable sector, but stagnated in the non-tradeable sector. Finally, the paper presents evidence which shows that both the functional and size distribution of income have become more skewed during the period of trade and investment liberalization (JEL 040,054). © 2003 Published by Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0142055931"

The aim of this study is to test the association between the suicide rate and unemployment (i.e., the unemployment rate for males and females in the period 1977–2015, and the long-term unemployment rate in the period 1983–2012) in Italy, by means of cointegration techniques. The analysis was adjusted for public unemployment spending (referring to the period 1980–2012). The study identified a long-run relationship between the suicide rate and long-term unemployment. On the other hand, an association between suicide and unemployment rate emerged, though statistically weaker. A 1% increase in long-term unemployment increases the suicide rate by 0.83%, with a long-term effect lasting up to 18 years. Public unemployment spending (as percentage of the Italian gross domestic product) may mitigate this association: when its annual growth rate is higher than 0.18%, no impact of unemployment on suicide in detectable. A decrease in the suicide rate is expected for higher amounts of social spending, which may be able to compensate for the reduced level of social integration resulting from unemployment, helping the individual to continue to integrate into society. A corollary of this is that austerity in times of economic recession may exacerbate the impact of the economic downturn on mental health. However, a specific “flexicurity” system (intended as a combination of high employment protection, job satisfaction and labour-market policies) may have a positive impact on health. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Austerity measures; Cointegration analysis; ECM; Italy; Suicide mortality","Economic Recession; Female; Financing, Government; Humans; Italy; Male; Models, Statistical; Sex Factors; Social Integration; Suicide; Unemployment; Article; economic recession; female; growth rate; human; integration; Italy; job market; job satisfaction; long term care; male; mental health; null hypothesis; Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development; priority journal; social change; suicide; unemployment; economics; epidemiology; financial management; psychology; sex factor; statistical model; suicide; unemployment","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85058391798"

We find huge job losses among immigrants, with an annual rate of job loss of close to 20% in 2009, compared to 7% for natives. A higher rate of job loss for immigrants is found to remain when we control for factors such as age and education. We also show how an outflow of non-nationals is occurring.

Our analysis is based on rich administrative data from Germany, with an observation period spanning more than 20 years. We apply inverse probability weighting (IPW) to flexibly control for the observed differences between women who were and were not displaced. To account for the differences in the composition of the women who were displaced in a downturn and the women who were displaced in an upswing, we use a double weighting estimator. Results show that the extent to which job displacement has adverse effects on fertility depends on the business cycle. The first-birth rates were much lower for women who were displaced in an economic downturn than for those who lost a job in an economic upturn. This result cannot be explained by changes in the observed characteristics of the displaced women over the business cycle. © 2017, The Author(s).","Business cycle; Fertility; Job loss; Mass layoffs; Unemployment","Adult; Economic Recession; Family Characteristics; Female; Germany; Humans; Parity; Socioeconomic Factors; Unemployment; adult; economic recession; family size; female; Germany; human; parity; socioeconomics; statistics and numerical data; unemployment","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85020168836"

The magnitude of the economic policy uncertainty index (EPU) and the geopolitical risk (GPR) increases significantly during extreme crisis periods such as covid crisis, but the earlier literature ignores how both risk measures impact on different asset classes during severe economic downturns. In this paper, we contribute by examining the hedging and safe-haven properties of gold, oil, equities, and foreign exchange rates against the United States (US) EPU and GPR by utilizing OLS regression, quantile regression and the quantile connectedness approach for pre-covid (October 1, 2013–March 10, 2020) and post-covid data (March 11, 2020–August 27, 2021). OLS results suggest that only the stock market has positive risk premium for both uncertainty measures. With quantile regression analysis for the pre-covid period, we find that asset returns provide no hedge (hedge) across bearish (bullish) market conditions. Importantly, safe-haven properties suggest that gold is a safe-haven asset at the extreme stress condition (at higher level of USEPU shocks). Other assets also exhibit safe-haven characteristics during extreme uncertain periods with heterogeneity in safe-haven effectiveness across bearish to bullish markets. With the post-covid data, we show that S&P500 stocks and EURO hedge EPU and GPR in bullish market condition, while Oil, S&P500, Great Britain Pound, EURO, Japanese Yen display safe-haven properties at the 99% quantile of USEPU. Specifically, gold lost its safe-haven features during covid. Interestingly, results from quantile connectedness suggest that selected asset returns have the potential to diversify against uncertainty measures considering low volatility transmissions between them across the lower and higher quantiles. Our findings are important for investors and asset managers who aim to hedge EPU and GPR during the stress period. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","EPU; Foreign exchange rates; Gold; GPR; Hedge; Oil; Safe-haven asset; Stocks","United States; Commerce; Financial markets; Gold; Investments; Planning; Public policy; Risk assessment; Uncertainty analysis; Wooden fences; Economic policies; Economic policy uncertainty index; Foreign exchange rates; Geopolitical risks; Gold; Hedge; Oil; Safe-haven asset; Stock; Uncertainty; COVID-19; currency; economic policy; exchange rate; geopolitics; gold; oil supply; regression analysis; stock market; uncertainty analysis; Regression analysis","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135957512"

Design/methodology/approach: The paper embarks on a theoretical and empirical literature review on AC adoption and its impact on a firm’s financial value. The paper uses data from 63 financial institutions and covers a 12-year period. Findings: The empirical results indicate that the adoption of an AC by financial institutions has a positive and statistically significant impact on firm value. The results from the pre-crisis period also indicate that the adoption of an AC makes a positive and significant contribution to firm value. However, there is no impact on firm value during the post-crisis period. The results suggest that the entire UK economy experienced an economic downturn after the financial crisis (2009-2011), and financial firms were no exception. Research limitations/implications: This study helps to fill research gaps on the relationships between ACs and firm value as they exist in UK financial institutions. These findings are important for policymakers and regulators. Practical implications: This research will encourage firms to establish ACs. Social implications: This new finding about the importance of firms having an AC in place is important for policymakers and regulators. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this research is the first to conduct an empirical study of the effect of AC adoption on UK financial institutions and firm value. Second, no single study has been conducted on the effects of AC adoption and its impact on either the pre- or post-financial crisis periods.

This leaves unanswered the question how much we should rely on firms’ sustainability-oriented voluntary initiatives at a time when the global economy continues to be weak and firms face persistent threats of decline. In addressing this question, we first argue that the effect of a decline would be different for peripheral and core initiatives. Using data gathered from 478 small firms representing multiple manufacturing sectors in the United States through a survey, we empirically demonstrate that a decline in a firm’s financial performance is associated with a higher decline of peripheral initiatives than of core initiatives. We further found that a decline in peripheral initiatives was even greater when a firm operated in a relatively dynamic context. Contextual dynamism, however, did not affect decline in core initiatives. © 2015, © 2015 SAGE Publications.","community and environmental initiatives; core–periphery; corporate social responsibility (CSR); cost stickiness; environmental dynamism; organizational decline; recession; small firms; SMEs","United States; core-periphery relations; cost analysis; firm size; global economy; manufacturing; performance assessment; small and medium-sized enterprise; sustainability","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84936770827"

It examines the consequence of the transformation of public-private income in higher education that followed the 1970s downturn, questioning whether the rise of private resources acted as additional or substitutive resources for public spending. The paper suggests that there is a risk that the cost-sharing strategy could be turned into a policy of public-private substitution of funding and provision, leading to a transfer rather than an increase of resources with strong implications on quality and equity. However, the Kondratiev cycle suggests an alternative route by designating the impact of the 1970s economic downturn on education as unique. Previous economic crises were contemporary of accelerations of public funding towards education which in fact contributed to economic recovery. The current crisis could represent an opportunity to revive counter-cyclical policy by looking not only at efficient public spending but also at developing fairer taxation. A revival of public funding complemented by an additional rather than substitutive diversification of income would rebalance the public-private structure of funding and drive a sustainable higher education system capable of playing a key part in these counter-cyclical transformations. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84867232705"

Using establishment-level occupational data, I construct a measure of firms' share of routine-task labor.

Fears about the economic situation have called attention to freight transportation performance as a derivative economic development demand. It is critical to economic growth, especially in industrialized countries with a strong positive relationship to road transport. The empirical evidence in developing countries, such as Colombia, showed that economic growth has had linked to road freight transport regardless of comparisons with other economic sectors. Thie main objective of the paper is to assess the impact caused by the COVID-19 restrictions on freight transport by road to depict the challenge between freight transport performance and economic growth. The total freight transported in 2020 was predicted based on a time series analysis considering the system's performance. As a result, in 2020, the ton of freight transported became only 40% of the predicted freight in the most critical month. The analysis can help planners implement policies to improve freight transport behavior and react during future economic downturns. Events such as the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrate that freight transportation must be fast and flexible, is crucial to act in the short term, and consider the long-term recovery. In addition, cooperation among the various economic sectors' stakeholders must be necessary. © 2022 The Author(s)","COVID-19; Economic growth; Freight transport; Time-series forecasting","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85125916553"

Based on a qualitative longitudinal (QLL) study, this paper explores the ways in which people experience, understand, make adaptations to, and live out their daily lives. It presents three men's accounts of how they have been affected by the economic downturn over the first year of fatherhood; a time when the demands of economic provision are often amplified. The case studies illustrate how changing economic circumstances have made previously routine expectations increasingly risky. These men aimed to provide the 'best start' for their children as a non-negotiable aspect of good fatherhood. However, the recession meant that providing this involved financial risk-taking. Presenting the data in a case study format enables us to illustrate the subjective experience of change over time, and consider how larger processes of social change are played out through individual trajectories.

Methods: Fixed effects panel regressions were used to assess the association between changes in unemployment rate and suicide rates. Additional models investigated the role of active labor market programs (ALMPs) as possible moderators of the association. Analyses were carried out for both males and females, stratified by age and region. Results: The negative time-trend displayed by suicide rate in Italy until 2007 was slowed down by changes in unemployment at the beginning of the GR, when this trend reversed and the rate of suicide started increasing. Male workers aged 25–64 and women aged 55–64 years were affected by both “normal” unemployment rate fluctuations as well as severe economic crises. Women aged 35–44 were only influenced by the latter. Men benefit from ALMPs mainly in Central Italy, while women did not benefit significantly from ALMPs. Conclusions: In Italy, economic downturns were associated with increased suicides mainly among men, while severe economic crises were associated with increased suicides among both men and women. ALMPs showed to be effective in moderating the association between unemployment and suicide among men aged 45–54 only in Central Italy. The overall small effectiveness of such programs may be due to lack of sufficient funding. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Active labor market programs; Economic crisis; Fixed effects panel regression; Italy; Suicide","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Economic Recession; Female; History, 20th Century; History, 21st Century; Humans; Italy; Male; Middle Aged; Occupations; Public Policy; Suicide; Unemployment; adolescent; adult; aged; economic recession; epidemiology; female; history; human; Italy; male; middle aged; occupation; psychology; public policy; suicide; trends; unemployment","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85056417842"

The authors' comprehensive analysis of growth in Fortune 100-size companies over the past half century revealed, in fact, that 87% of them had stalled out at least once. The record shows that if management cannot turn a company around within a few years, the odds are that it will never again see healthy top-line growth. Fortunately, Olson, van Bever, and Verry, of the Corporate Executive Board, have uncovered and categorized the most common causes of growth stalls. The majority of these standstills are preventable because, according to the authors, they arise from management choices about strategy or organizational design; external factors, such as regulatory actions or economic downturns, account for only 13%. Four categories predominate: Premium-position captivity. When a firm's world-class offering has won the most demanding customers in the market, it often fails to respond effectively to new, low-cost competitive challenges or shifts in customer valuation of product features. Innovation management breakdown. Because most large corporations generate sequential product innovations, any systemic inefficiency or dysfunction in the innovation chain can cause extremely serious problems that last for years. Premature core abandonment. Managers may conclude too quickly that a core market is saturated. Or they may incorrectly interpret operational impediments in the core business as evidence that it's time to move into new competitive terrain. Talent bench shortfall. Insufficient capabilities - particularly at the executive level and typically in areas of acute and specialized need -will stop growth dead in its tracks. The authors also identified a common culprit in detailed case studies of 50 stalled companies -failure to adapt the assumptions that drive company strategy to changes in the external environment. Two tools can help managers avoid growth stalls; a self-test to diagnose impending stalls and a choice of practices to explicitly identify strategic assumptions and test them for ongoing relevance.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-40949159881"

In 2009, U.S. schools employed 13% fewer SETs than in 2006. The number of annual new hires of SETs also dropped dramatically in some states. The onset of these declines predated the economic downturn of 2008 and resulted in part from a steady decline since 2005 in the number of students with disabilities (SWD) served. We consider factors that may be contributing to declining demand for SETs, among them the number of SWD, service delivery, the economic downturn, and present supporting evidence. We also consider the potential impact of reduced demand on SET supply, teacher education, equitable distribution of teachers, and, most importantly, outcomes for SWD. We call for vigilance and monitoring of SET employment data to assure that all students receive the appropriate education to which they are entitled. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84875824337"

The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic at the beginning of 2020 intensified the crisis, causing a drastic decline in aggregate demand and output. India and the UK have resorted to monetary and fiscal stimulus packages to face the economic crisis. This study investigated the inflation-unemployment dynamics during the recession and COVID-19 times in India and the UK. Using a generalized additive model (GAM), the results of this study revealed that the recession had given way to stagflation in India. In contrast, in the UK, it has led to a more severe recession in the short-run. During the downturn, policy initiatives aggravate the recession and eventually turn to stagflation in India due to inflation caused by the weak supply side. However, in the UK, the policy initiatives during this downturn pushed the economy into a deeper recession due to reduced demand. The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has had a similar recessionary impact on both economies. A time horizon based recovery plan is suggested to help the economies recover from stagflation and even deeper recession. This framework could enable policymakers to choose the right path of recovery within the shortest possible time. © 2021 by the author.

We find that the entire predicted distribution of GDP growth conditional on the EPU index evolves over time beyond the central tendency. The EPU index alters the predicted distribution's higher moments, amplifies the growth tail risk, and improves the model's forecast performance; this could serve as a basis for preemptive action.

In this study, we use North Carolina administrative data from 2006 to 2011 on child maltreatment reports and job losses to distinguish effects on maltreatment frequency from effects on severity, identify the timing of these effects, and test whether community characteristics moderate these effects. To isolate effects of unanticipated job losses and to control for potential confounding factors, we use a fixed effects regression approach. We find that, though job losses did not affect the frequency of reports, job losses increased the share of reports that were relatively severe.

There are two main federal programs that provide funding for such incentives for small U.S. airports: the Essential Air Service (EAS) program and the Small Community Air Service Development Grant (SCASDG) program. While the EAS program has received considerable academic attention, there has been no comprehensive analysis of the success of SCASDG recipients in attracting and retaining their targeted air service.Using a metric of SCASD grant success, this paper evaluates the outcomes of 115 SCASD grantees from 2006 to 2011. In each year, fewer than half of the grant recipients were ultimately successful in meeting the goals of their proposal. Several case studies suggest that successful grantees often had significant community or airline support prior to submitting their grant and were located in slightly larger-than-average communities. Further careful consideration is necessary to determine whether reform of the SCASDG program is warranted to more effectively support the development of small community air service in the United States. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Airport incentives; Capacity discipline; Small airports; Small Community Air Service Development Grant program","United States; air transportation; airport; incentive; public spending; transportation development","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84904601854"

By means of a survey experiment, we aim to explore the mechanisms of blame and credit when a rally around the flag coincides with a major economic downturn, and we estimate the effects of the Crimean events and the economic crisis on how Russians assess the performance of federal political institutions. Our findings suggest that economic hardships are attributed exclusively to the government and the State Duma, while it is only the president who benefits from the rally around the flag. Moreover, the president receives an additional benefit when the “patriotic unity” priming meets the “economic hardship” priming, thereby resulting in a double rally around the flag effect. This suggests that the president stands apart from state institutions when responsibility is assigned, and he is the only one to enjoy national consolidation around him, which is further reinforced by poor economic conditions. Spotlighting the president increases his popularity and consequently increases the costs of political divides, while the legislature and the government can be exploited as scapegoats for policy failures. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Blame attribution; economic crisis; electoral authoritarianism; public opinion; rally around the flag; Russia; survey experiment","Russian Federation; authoritarianism; economic conditions; economic instability; electoral system; federal system; party politics","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85068751502"

Focus is given to the development of one key talent group – line managers – in subsidiaries of multinational corporations (MNCs). Specifically, the paper examines: whether there is a positive relationship between Management Development (MD) and perceived subsidiary performance; and whether national context mediates any link between MD and perceived subsidiary performance. A multirespondent survey was undertaken generating a sample of 143 UKowned MNCs. For each organisation, interviews were completed with the Head of HR at corporate Head Quarters; the HR Manager/Specialist and a line manager in both the domestic and foreign subsidiaries of the sample organisation. A total of 5 respondents per organisation is used in the analysis. The link between the MD variables and perceived subsidiary performance is consistently positive and robust in all of the models estimated. HR having a strategic role in the organisation is positively associated with perceived subsidiary performance; the interaction between strategic HR and the level and extent of MD and perceived subsidiary performance is also highly significant and positive. National context significantly mediates the relationship between MD and perceived subsidiary performance. Investing in talent management, specifically the development of the key talent group of line managers, is positively associated with perceived subsidiary performance. The national context in which this investment is undertaken is found to affect the associated returns. The sample analysed is for UK owned MNCs only and, thus, the potential for “country of origin” effects is not examined. In previous economic downturns, training and development budgets have often been drastically reduced. While any such slashing in MD budgets will reduce expenditure – given the positive association found in this analysis between the level and extent of MD and perceived subsidiary performance – this approach is likely to only have shortrun benefits and could jeopardise future competitive advantage. Continued investment in talent is likely to be pivotal for sustained competitive advantage. The multirespondent and multilocation methodology used is highly original and the findings contribute to the expanding literature on the relationship between MD and performance/perceived performance of organisations. © 2012, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","European firms; Key talent group; Management development; Multinational corporations (MNCs); Multiresponded methodology; Perceived performance; Talent management","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84986170731"

Combining ideas from complex adaptive systems and critical urban studies, we develop a set of boundary concepts (unsettlement, unevenness, and unbounding) to understand the complexities of compound urban crises from an interdisciplinary perspective. We employ these concepts to set a research agenda on compound urban crises, highlighting multiple interconnections between urban politics and global dynamics. We conclude by suggesting how these entry points provide a theoretical anchor to develop practical insights to inform and reform urban governance. © 2022, The Author(s).","Cities; Complex adaptive systems; Compound urban crises; Critical urban studies; Governance","Cities; Climate Change; Pandemics; anchor; governance approach; interdisciplinary approach; urban area; urban politics; city; climate change; pandemic","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85124770199"

The second Bolivian ""revolution"" involved not only the shift from stateled economic development to neoliberalism but also a shift from corporatism to pluralism.

While industry players typically attribute the prevalence of cash in the region to questions of infrastructure readiness, transaction costs, and cyber-security, this paper finds that plans to expand digital payments at the expense of cash may not be well-adapted to countries with high levels of socio-economic inequality. It proposes a link between socio-economic inequality and use of cash in emerging economies, and concludes that it may be better to not view the relationship between cash and digital payments in binary zero-sum terms, until there is a better understanding of the socio-economic, technological, and policy context in which countries like South Korea and Sweden have managed to reduce their reliance on cash in favor of a diversified digital payments eco-system. © 2020 by the author.","cashless economy; complementary currencies; digital payments; financial inclusion; Gulf Cooperation Council; inequality; non-cash transactions; oil economies; remittances","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85104594261"

It is shown that firm control value is directly affected by changes in the legal protection for minority shareholders, on a sample of dual-class firms listed on the main Brazil exchange, the BOVESPA. Control value increased more than twice in the second half of 1997 in response to the introduction of Law 9457/1997, which weakens minority shareholder protection. Control values dropped to pre-1997 levels in the beginning of 1999 in response to CVM (the Brazilian SEC equivalent) Instruction 299/1999, which reinstates some of the minority protection rules scrapped by the previous legal change. The effect of legal changes on control value is robust, and is not due to underlying changes in the intensity of acquisition activity, or the economic downturn in the late 1990's. The behavior of voting and non-voting share prices during the period are consistent with the hypotheses that (1) majority shareholders share some of the control benefits with minority vote-holders, and (2) majority shareholders increase expropriation activity during the period, especially as concerns the value of non-voting equity.

Research on the diversionary use of force assumes that leaders (especially democratic leaders) use force abroad to bolster their domestic political fortunes during hard economic times. But other research suggests that crises either lead to removal from office or have no effect on incumbents' political fortunes. Although a good deal of scholarship assesses the role of the economy on electoral outcomes, no research has explicitly examined the interactive effects between dispute involvement and the economy on leaders' share of the vote. We argue that the salience of the economy conditions voters' sensitivity to the costs of conflict, which reduces electoral support for incumbent parties engaging in dramatic foreign policy events. Moreover, we expect executives' efforts to emphasize foreign policy during economic downturns to be met with electoral punishment as voters prefer to see leaders working on a remedial economic policy. To evaluate this argument, we examine incumbent parties' vote shares in elections among nine advanced democracies from 1960 to 2000. Our results support the hypothesis that during economic downturns voters care more about domestic politics than foreign policy. Furthermore, our results have implications for the diversionary hypothesis, gambling for resurrection argument, the democratic peace, and economic voting research agendas. © 2010 The Author(s).","conflict; diversionary theory; economy; elections; vote choice","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-78649928312"

The study focused on three dimensions of industrial practices: (1) the use of training and investments in technology, (2) the nature of employment relations, and (3) the use of design. The analysis reveals that the most globally competitive firms operating in a Canadian institutional context prosper by learning a set of production practices and the value of design-intensive products from the embodied knowledge of their founders, who have lived, studied and worked in high-wage, coordinated market economies of continental Europe.

One of the most dramatic outcomes of the crisis is the increase in poverty, but its extent will remain unknown until household income data is collected and analyzed. We propose a simple approach to provide early estimates, micro-simulating the short-run effect of the crisis on the poverty rate. It combines household level micro-data, estimates on the feasibility of working from home, information on key public policies (e.g., cash-transfers, unemployment insurance), and forecasts of GDP contraction. This approach, which can be easily adapted and applied to different countries, allows to nowcast the current poverty level and the poverty-reducing effect of public policies, while providing full micro-macro consistency between heterogeneous impacts on households and the shock to aggregate GDP. Moreover, it enables to estimate the effect on informal and self-employed workers, of utmost importance in developing countries. We illustrate the methodology with an application for Uruguay, finding that during the first full trimester of the crisis, the poverty rate grew by more than 38%, reaching 11.8% up from 8.5%. Moreover, cash transfers implemented by the government in the period had a positive but very limited effect in mitigating this poverty spike, which could be neutralized with additional transfers worth under 0.5% of Uruguay's annual GDP. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","COVID-19; Latin America; Microsimulations; Nowcasting; Poverty; Uruguay","Latin America; Uruguay; COVID-19; crisis management; developing world; feasibility study; government; Gross Domestic Product; household structure; nowcasting; poverty; social policy","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097737913"

It gives voice to the experiences of migrant nurses and illustrates the financial obligations they maintain while working overseas. Although the international economic recession has decreased global remittance flows, they remain resilient. Drawing on the experiences of migrant nurses in Ireland, this paper indicates how and why migrants strive to maintain remittance flows, even in an economic downturn. Methods: A mixed-methods approach was employed, and the paper draws on data from qualitative in-depth interviews undertaken with 21 migrant nurses in addition to a quantitative survey of 336 migrant nurses in Ireland. Results: The survey of migrant nurses revealed that 87% (293) of the sample sent remittances on a regular basis. According to respondents, remittances made a huge difference in the lives of their family members back home. Remittances were used to ensure that family members could obtain access to health and education services. They were also used to provide an income source for family members who were unemployed or retired. As remittances played an essential role in supporting family members back home, respondent migrant nurses were reluctant to reduce the level of their remittances, despite the onset of a global recession. Respondents noted that an increased demand for remittances from their families coincided with a reduction in their own net salaries - as a result of increased taxes and reduced availability of overtime - and this was a cause for concern for Ireland's migrant nurses. Conclusion: This paper provides insights into the importance of remittances in funding social support for family members in home countries. It also illustrates the sacrifices made by migrant nurses to ensure continuation of the remittances, particularly in the context of an economic recession. © 2009 Humphries et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-68949208642"

It also investigates the effect of these factors on the stock markets of both economies. The impact of these variables on broad market indices and sectoral indices is investigated and compared too. Design/methodology/approach: The publications for the study were retrieved from databases such as Emerald Insight, EBSCO, ScienceDirect and JSTOR using the keywords “Macroeconomic variables” and “Stock market” or “Stock market performance.” The result demonstrated a growing corpus of scholarly work in the domain of stock market. The study was carried out separately for each macroeconomic indicator. Given a large number of articles under consideration, the authors began by reading the titles and abstracts of all publications to identify those that were relevant. The papers are evaluated in Excel and the articles for review range from 1972 to 2021. Findings: The authors found that gross domestic product (GDP), FDI (Foreign Direct Investment) and FII (Foreign Institutional Investment) have a positive effect on both emerging and developed economies’ stock market while gold price has a negative effect. Interest rates had a negative impact on both economies except for a few developing countries. The relationship with oil prices was positive for oil exporting countries while negative for oil importing countries. Inflation, money supply and GDP are the macroeconomic variables that have the same effect on sectoral indices as they do on broad market indices. The impact was sector-specific for the remaining variables. Research limitations/implications: This paper gives an overview of relation and effect covering variety of macroeconomic variables and stock market indices. Still, there is a scope for further research to analyze the effect on thematic, strategy and sectoral indices. A longer time horizon with new variables, such as bank deposit growth rate, nonperforming assets of banks, consumer confidence index and investor sentiment, can be studied using high-frequency data. This research may help stakeholders adopt and manage their policies during a crisis or economic slump. Practical implications: This study will assist investors, researchers and educators in the fields of economics and finance in understanding how macroeconomic factors affect the stock market. Furthermore, this study can guide in portfolio diversification strategy across multiple sectors by examining the impact of macroeconomic factors specific to sectoral indices. This paper provides insight into society and researchers since it integrates a number of macroeconomic variables and their interaction with the stock market. It may also help pension funds and mutual fund firms to hedge their funds and allocate equity portfolios. Originality/value: With respect to India, this study looked at new macroeconomic variables and sectors. It contrasted the impact of these variables in developed and developing economies. The effect of broad and sectoral stock indexes was also investigated and compared. The authors examined how these variables responded during crisis and economic downturns by using articles from a longer time frame. This research also looked into how changing the frequency of data for the variables altered stock performance.

In line with previous research, we find that men are more optimistic than women; however, men are also more prone to be wrong in their beliefs about the future economic situation. Furthermore, in sharp economic downturns, the gender differences in optimism disappear.

Design/methodology/approach: By using a GARCH model with a generalized error distribution (GED), this study specifies that the gold (or silver) return is a function of a set of economic and uncertainty variables, which include volatility from interest rate innovation, a change in economic policy uncertainty (EPU), a change in geopolitical risk (GPR) and volatility due to pandemic diseases, while controlling for stock market returns, inflation rates, economic growth and the Chinese currency value. Findings: This study employs monthly data of gold and silver prices over the period from January 2002 to August 2021 to examine hedging behavior. Estimated results show that the gold return is positively correlated to the stock return and a rise in uncertainty from economic policy innovation, geopolitical risk, volatility due to US interest rate innovation as well as COVID-19 infection. This result suggests that gold cannot be used to hedge against a stock market decline, but can be used to hedge against uncertainty in general. However, the silver return only responds positively to a rise in uncertainty from the inflation rate and geopolitical risk. Evidence shows that silver returns are negatively correlated with stock returns, and display hedging characteristics. However, the evidence lacks statistically significance during the COVID-19 period, suggesting that the role of silver as a safe-haven asset against stock market turmoil is weak for this time period. Research limitations/implications: More general nonlinear specifications can be developed. The tests may include different measures of uncertainty that interact with each other or with the lagged error terms. An implication of the model is that gold can be used to hedge against a broad range of uncertainties for economic policy change, political risk and/or a pandemic. However, the use of gold as an asset to hedge against a stock downturn in Chinese market should be done with caution. Practical implications: This study has important policy implications as regards a choice in assets in formatting a portfolio to hedge against uncertainty. Specifically, this study presents empirical evidence on gold and silver return behavior and finds that gold returns respond positively to heightened uncertainty. Thus, gold is a good asset to hedge against uncertainty arising from policy innovations and infectious disease uncertainty. Social implications: This paper provides insightful information on the choice of assets toward hedging against risk in the uncertainty market conditions. It provides information to investors and policy makers to use gold price movements as a signal for detecting the arrival of uncertainty. This study also provides information for demanding a risk premium for infectious disease. Originality/value: This study empirically analyzes and verifies the role that gold serves as a safe haven asset to hedge against uncertainty in the Chinese market. This paper contributes to the literature by presenting evidence of risk/uncertainty premiums for holding gold against various sources of uncertainty such as economic policy uncertainty, geopolitical risk and equity market volatility due to US interest rate innovation and/or COVID-19. This study finds evidence that supports the use of a nonlinear specification, which demonstrates the interaction of uncertainty with the lagged change of infectious disease and helps to explain the gold/silver return behavior. Further, evidence shows that the gold return is positively correlated to the stock return. This finding contrasts with evidence in the US market. However, silver returns are negatively correlated with stock returns, but this correlation becomes insignificant during the period of COVID-19. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Economic policy uncertainty; Geopolitical risk; Gold price; Inflation; Safe-haven; Silver price","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85132296653"

It suggests that around 75 per cent of the VAT reduction will be passed on to consumers and that consumers will react by maintaining their expenditure levels and therefore increasing their demand for consumption goods. The uncertainty caused by the downturn makes this a more muted impact than we might have hoped, especially on the demand for durable goods. Nevertheless, it is a substantive impact. In general, the uncertainty caused by the recession will tend to reduce the impact of any stimulus package. It is also argued that synchronising the subsequent rise with the economic upturn is critical. © 2009 Institute for Fiscal Studies.","Consumer debt; Consumer demand; Fiscal policy; Fiscal stimulus; Recession; VAT","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-65249113160"

Using Cameroon as a case study, we examine the effects of economic downturns on child fosterage as a component of changes in rural-urban solidarity. Results show a net decline in rural out-fosterage rates during the years of economic decline. Such findings raise concern for the economic mobility prospects for children from rural families, especially in a climate of increased competition for limited formal-sector employment.","","Africa; financial crisis; kinship; rural society; rural-urban comparison; social network","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0036291740"

This context, combining crisis conditions and the agency of economic actors, should be related to greater flexibility in labor allocations, leading to the feminization of farming. However, a contrasting perspective argues for rigidity of gender roles in farming. We use data from a twelve-state midwestern sample and a more detailed Ohio study.

It came suddenly, leaving much destruction in its wake, in the form of bankruptcies and business closures, retrenchment, wage cuts and ultimately high unemployment. Much has been written about the financial, economic and social ramifications of the crisis. This paper takes a critical look at the human resource practices adopted by an industry that appears to have been particularly, affected by the subsequent economic downturn - the hotel industry. We consider how managers responded to the economic turbulence by confronting the apparently dichotomous pressures of tightening structure and managerial control, on the one hand, and the need to permit the flexibility that would facilitate change and innovativeness; on the other. Findings from a sample of hotels suggest that, while managers recognize the need to allow flexibility that would foster employee creativity, there remain deep-seated cultural and other factors that militate against such flexibility. This casts doubt on the organizations' ability to generate and sustain employee creativity and a climate in which employees can respond to unexpected challenges as they struggle to satisfy equally unusual customer demands.","Asian crisis; Flexibility; Hong Kong; Hotel industry; Human resources; Structure","China; financial crisis; human resource; resource management; service sector","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0345098608"

Generally, high leverage appears to inhibit a firm's ability or willingness to compete aggressively, especially against well-financed competitors. Debt also disciplines the manager-worker relationship, preventing managers from hoarding labor during economic downturns. Many of the studies also indicate that the firm's relationships with its customers can be disrupted by concerns over the firm's long-term viability. This chapter also highlights and discusses approaches researchers have taken to address endogeneity. Because the firm chooses leverage in advance, most of the studies it considers focus on exogenous shocks-either to the firm's competitive environment or to its leverage ratio. Furthermore, it discusses endogeneity problems that arise in empirical corporate finance research in general and describes how researchers studying capital structure explicitly deal with this problem. Apart from this, it sheds light on the connection between capital structure and a firm's corporate strategy that potentially suffer from significant endogeneity problems. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The study is unique as it uses segment data made available only recently, which enables the examination of both product and international diversification with performance. The period studied coincided with Singapore firms' performance during the Asian Financial Crisis. In contrast to previous studies on Singapore, our results show that product diversification is negatively correlated to all measures of performance, while international market diversification is positively correlated. We attribute the difference to the time period which covers both upswings and downturns of the economy, unlike previous studies which considered only the former. Other control measures were incorporated; firm size is highly significant in explaining all measures of performance but not so for firm age, leverage, risk and industry. For top managers, we suggest that regardless of economic climate, the dominant diversification strategy is to take a focused approach to product diversification, but a broad approach to international diversification. © 2005 Springer Science + Business Media, Inc.","Firm performance; International diversification; Product diversification","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-17444431236"

Even with the downturn in freight volumes due to recent economic conditions, forecasts are that freight volumes will rebound and will increase dramatically by 2020, resulting in substantial increases in congestion. The port industry is under pressure to develop strategies and capacity to accommodate these increasing freight volumes. Efficient gate operations are crucial to intermodal freight terminals since their impact is not isolated to the efficiency of the operations within the terminal but also extends to the road traffic on nearby freeways and access ramps. Inefficient gate operations can spill over to the surrounding roadway network causing serious safety and congestion problems, and degrading the reliability and performance of carriers, shippers, and terminal operators. Since intermodal freight terminals tend to be located in or near major cities, where right of way is limited and very expensive, implementing operational strategies to reduce the effect of the terminals truck related traffic to the surrounding roadway network becomes more important and more viable than physical capacity expansions. There is an ongoing discussion concerning the implementation of different gate operation strategies that may relieve these effects. Among the gate operation strategies being considered to relieve the impacts of congestion and delay are gate appointment systems, extended hours of operations for terminal gates, and advanced technologies for gates and terminals. The purpose of this paper is to critically review the published literature on the different gate strategies. This paper also presents existing attempts at reducing truck queues at terminal gates and improving terminal operations and traffic conditions in the vicinity of the terminals and the technologies available that support the implementation of this type of strategies. © (2010) by the Transportation Research Forum All rights reserved.","","Containers; Port terminals; Trucks; Advanced technology; Capacity expansion; Congestion problem; Economic condition; Marine container terminals; Operational strategies; Terminal operation; Terminal operators; Traffic congestion","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84883781753"

Pilgrimages are being stopped, and mass gatherings are halted. We are in middle of a very difficult time for the religious tourism industry and this has become a major concern for governments around the world. The leading nations such as USA, UK, Italy, Spain, Japan, Russia, Germany and China are struggling to control the COVID-19 pandemic. We are facing the biggest test of the tourism industry in over half a century, one which has exceeded the downturn of the 9/11 terrorism attacks. In the last 6-9 months, COVID-19 has had major ramifications for the religious tourism industry and impacted on other related industries like hotels, transport, travel agents and tour organisers, tour guides and all tourism service industries. The calamity of the COVID-19 pandemic is a new biological war that is being experienced by the whole world and the tourism industry is one of the major victim of this pandemic outbreak. Academics, politicians, scientists, theologians, in fact all people are discussing the impact of COVID-19 on all aspects of life. The pandemic impact is being experienced by all people regardless of state, religion, race, age or status. It is not first time, nor the last time that the world has been struck by a pandemic, but commentators suggest that a new world will emerge from this, and this new reality will offer new opportunities for the provision of experience by the tourism industry. The implication of COVID-19 for pilgrimage to religious sites has been enormous, and has altered the thinking and beliefs of visitors. Due to limitations and controls imposed by governments, new forms to spirituality and worship have been introduced, and these lead to the development of alternative religious thinking. This paper seeks to clarify the impact of COVID-19 on the religious tourism industry and discusses the challenges experienced by travellers to religious destinations. © International Journal of Religious Tourism and Pilgrimage","COVID-19; Pandemic; Pilgrimage; Tourism industry; Visitors","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85098240318"

This paper examines the human resource challenges associated with the industrial expansion during the period of transition from the boom era to the subsequent economic downturn that saw the collapse of the economy in 1997. Based on in-depth interviews with managers across eleven major industrial sectors, observations of office and factory practice, this paper attempts to characterize the diversity of approaches available and how they reflect the social-cultural and economic realities in Thailand today. Three generic HR models are identified: traditional, transitional and progressive. We assess the key definitive features of these models, identify some major thematic differences, and examine the relative importance of these models in the commitment to develop a competent and innovative workforce. Finally, we identify some possible avenues for further research, and set out a number of managerial and policy implications.","Culture; Economic downturn; Human resource management; Innovativeness; Southeast Asia; Thailand","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0345683905"

In Brazil, considerable improvements in social inclusion have fostered the emergence of hundreds of thousands of first-time fliers over the past decades. We apply a two-step regression methodology in which the first step consists of identifying air transport markets characterized by greater social inclusion, using indicators of the local economies’ income distribution, credit availability, and access to the Internet. In the second step, we inspect the drivers of the plunge in air travel demand since the pandemic began, differentiating markets by their predicted social inclusion intensity. After controlling for potential endogeneity stemming from the spread of COVID-19 through air travel, our results suggest that short and low-density routes are among the most impacted airline markets and that business-oriented routes are more impacted than leisure ones. Finally, we estimate that a market with 1% higher social inclusion is associated with a 0.153%–0.166% more pronounced decline in demand during the pandemic. Therefore, markets that have benefited from greater social inclusion in the country may be the most vulnerable to the current crisis. © 2021","Air transport; COVID-19; Demand; Emerging markets; LASSO regression","Brazil; Centrarchus; Coronavirus; air transportation; COVID-19; income distribution; Internet; local economy; policy implementation; social inclusion; transportation policy; travel demand","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85106291071"

The simulation results show that reforms to rebalance the pattern of demand in regional economies (such as Mainland China) more towards domestic demand could entail non-negligible benefits for the EMEAP. These benefits could be even larger for those economies that more flexibly adjust to the shift in China's trade pattern. The simulation results also demonstrate that structural reforms in EMEAP economies will allow them to reduce vulnerabilities to economic downturns in major economies. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

(2020) [The unprecedented stock market reaction to COVID-19.

We extended the literature by using this newly developed ID-EMV index to examine its asymmetric effect on the share market returns of the G7 countries, which include the United Kingdom, Italy, Japan, Germany, France, Canada, and the United States of America. Moreover, we used novel techniques like the quantile-on-quantile regression test, quantile cointegration test, and quantile unit root test. The quantile cointegration test indicates that the infectious disease EMV index is cointegrated with G7 stock returns. Moreover, the quantile-on-quantile regression technique reveals that the infectious disease index positively affects stock returns during bullish states of the stock markets. In contrast, it negatively affects stock returns during bearish states of the stock market returns. The negative effect of the bearish states implies that investors may discourage investments during the downturns of the economy, whereas they need to boost their investments during economic booms.  © 2023 World Scientific Publishing Company.","G7 stock markets; ID-EMV index; Quantile cointegration; quantile-on-quantile regression","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142286373"

However, the period of high profile growth of South–South cooperation (SSC) under President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (2003–2010) was followed by a period of contraction under President Dilma Rousseff (2011–16). Rousseff's lower interest in foreign policy and Brazil's domestic economic and political difficulties have been the two main reasons advanced to explain this shift. We concur, but in this article we seek to nuance this argument. First, we suggest that the ‘retreat’ from SSC was not as deep as sometimes assumed. Second, we identify legacies from the Lula era which left Brazilian development cooperation vulnerable to downturns. These are: (a) the difficulties in updating legislation and institutions to accommodate the expanded role of Brazilian development cooperation; (b) the difficulties in cultivating political and public constituencies; and (c) enduring inter-Ministerial fragmentation. In the penultimate section, we comment on the early indications of where the post-impeachment Temer Presidency will lead SSC. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.

Investigating the potential amplification of volatility spillovers among major global stock markets and international energy commodity markets, driven by geopolitical risks (GPR), economic policy uncertainty (EPU), and the Climate Risk Index (CRI), is of paramount importance. This study focuses on whether these uncertainties intensify the degree of volatility spillovers in macroeconomic upturns and downturns. Employing daily price data from January 2003 to August 2023 for the world's ten stock markets and international energy markets, we utilize the Time-Varying Parameter Vector Autoregression with Stochastic Volatility (TVP-VAR-SV) model and the Dynamic Conditional Correlation Multivariate GARCH (DCC-MVGARCH) model to investigate dynamic volatility spillovers. Additionally, we apply the Dynamic Conditional Correlation - Mixed Data Sampling with Exogenous Variables (DCC-MIDAS-X) model to assess the impact of monthly GPR, CRI, and EPU on the volatility spillovers. The study finds that, while all three uncertainty factors—GPR, EPU, and CRI—significantly affect volatility spillovers overall, their impact is more pronounced during economic recession and growth. The influence of specific factors intensifies, while that of others diminishes, varying across distinct economic periods. Moreover, these uncertainties not only directly influence the volatility spillovers between major stock markets and specific energy commodity markets but also indirectly affect volatility spillovers across various international energy commodity markets. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.","Climate risk; Economic policy uncertainty; Geopolitical risk; Stock-energy markets; Volatility spillover","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85185607683"

Generative qualities (e.g., confidence in one's skills, desire to assist others) were significant predictors of time spent volunteering and secular giving, while religious identification was the strongest predictor of religious giving. Perceived social integration was a significant predictor of time volunteering and religious giving. Implications for nonprofit organizations that need to recruit more volunteers and donors, especially during economic downturns, are discussed, including personal invitations to volunteer based on knowledge of an individual's skills and talents, encouraging meeting attendance and promoting social embeddedness, and secular organizations' appeals to religious donors based on their religious motivations.","Nonprofit organizations; Religious giving; Religious identification; Secular giving; Social embeddedness; Social integration; Time volunteering","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84865153870"

It aims to advocate the value of a well-considered strategy for the venture for superior business performance and consider the ways in which entrepreneurs can devise, control and communicate strategy. Design/methodology/approach - Strategic thinking and planning are strongly related to small business financial performance. This is confirmed by the research reported here, that showed quite conclusively that strategic thinking is an essential ingredient in enterprise survival, performance and growth. The original research on which this paper is based, had as its central objective to investigate the nature, style, value and development of strategic management in a sample of 87 small businesses in six industry sectors based in the UK Midlands. Findings - A central finding was that the principal value of strategic planning to those firms that practiced and valued it, was that they had a framework for their assessments of overall performance. Research limitations/implications - Semi-structured interviews were undertaken which included questions about the current fortunes, management attitudes and market position of the business. Specifically, the interviews aimed to find out: How the firm had dealt with any economic downturn: Problems arising from market changes: What major decisions were taken as a result of the problems and opportunities that surfaced: The level of satisfaction and confidence with the decisions taken and their outcomes and the value and contribution of strategic management. Practical implications - Those small firms that have survived, prospered and grown, exhibited most or all of the following characteristics: They had a firm grip on their finances. They examined business forecasts carefully and returned to the original business plan to check principal assumptions made about sales volume and cash flow. They reduced the money that debtors owed by implementing an effective credit management system and/or used factoring. Many had a pricing plan and took a strategic view when setting price. Originality/value - Strategy in the small firms that are referred to here is enacted in a highly personalised manner and is strongly influenced by the actions, abilities, personality and success criteria of the key role players. The successful firms examined here are adopting a more imaginative and strategic approach to risk. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Business performance; Corporate strategy; Small enterprises","","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-33845575070"

The content of the article refers to: (1) model issues concerning the possible ways of using consolidation as a method of risk mitigation in the mining company life cycle, (2) identification and analysis of consolidation schemes used in coal mining in Europe, and (3) assessment of consolidation processes carried out in a nearly 20-year research perspective for Poland's hard coal mining. Consolidation can theoretically be used at every stage of the life cycle of a mining enterprise. In the phase of its creation, its task is to accelerate the development and reduce the capital and cost of construction of mines and mining enterprises. In the development and declining phase, it can be used as a way to extend the duration of individual phases and extend the life of a mine or a mining company. In Europe, mining companies were consolidated due to market risk (lack of efficiency, progressing decarbonization, prohibition of subsidizing mining production by the state) and, subsequently, the risk of bankruptcy. In case of Polish hard coal mining, macro-level consolidation occurred three times: 1) in 1993, by merging independent hard coal mines into six mining enterprises, 2) in 2003, by establishing Kompania Węglowa SA, and 3) in 2016, by creating a Polish Mining Group and incorporating it to the energy sector. Presented consolidation processes were occasionally effective and allowed achieving positive economic efficiency. Nevertheless, under the conditions of economic downturn and the decline in hard coal prices, financial results slumped rapidly, and consolidated enterprises were on the verge of bankruptcy, unable to stop the steady increase in production costs induced by social pressure and industry trade unions. © 2018 The Author","Coal mining; Consolidation; Life cycle of a mining company; Risk reduction","Poland [Central Europe]; Anthracite; Coal deposits; Coal industry; Coal research; Commerce; Consolidation; Costs; Economic and social effects; Industrial relations; Life cycle; Risk assessment; Risk management; Coal mining; Consolidation process; Economic downturn; Economic efficiency; Management method; Methodological approach; Mining companies; Risk reductions; bankruptcy; coal industry; coal mining; life cycle analysis; production cost; risk assessment; Coal mines","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85059510906"

Flexible sojourning across the border has long been pursued by the local population in this region as a means of survival during natural catastrophes, economic downturns, wars and political turmoil. Cross-border population mobility has acquired a new momentum in recent years subsequent to the uneven economic and social changes on the two sides of the border. The border-crossers are, seemingly, a uniform group of people whose travel behavior does not deviate from the expectation of conventional wisdom. However, a closer analysis reveals significant differences among the border-crossers. Four main types of border-crossers are identified: shoppers, workers, homebuyers and elderly retirees. Each type demonstrates distinct patterns of border-crossing and makes the trip out of different considerations. Border-crossing has different meanings to people of different social identities. Cross-border mobility can be and has been used by different kinds of people in different ways as a personal strategy to take on the challenges of structural changes at home and across the border. The article calls for an extension of border studies beyond the existing emphasis on border functioning, nation-states and regional development toward examining more seriously and carefully the ordinary people who are involved in border-crossing as a practice of their everyday life. © Joint Editors and Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.","","Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East; Guangdong; Hong Kong; border region; globalization; human settlement; population migration","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-33747123326"

From this point of view, the recovery of employment and revival of strong growth requires more than short-term monetary easing and temporary fiscal stimulus. Economists and policy makers need to explore how the process of demand formation failed after 2007 and where demand will come from going forward.

Reliance on networks of private agents for service production contributes to the disarticulated and fragmented state and increases the potential for systemic crisis if shocks to the network occur, putting vulnerable clients at risk. Government must focus on understanding systemic risk in networked governance arrangements and building resilient networks to avoid crises, the authors argue. Finally, potential research on systemic risk in networked governance arrangements is discussed.

All three countries maintained fixed exchange rates, but the degree of fiscal austerity varied across the countries, with Estonia undertaking the strongest fiscal consolidation in 2009. The downturn was so swift and deep that expansionary policies were unlikely to affect short-term outcomes. Growth returned towards the end of 2009, largely driven by exports. The export performance cannot be directly linked to the austerity policies. The main lesson from the Baltics is that increased macroeconomic stability must be attained by avoiding overheating and unsustainable financial exposure.

First, we show that the same dynamical system that generates the equilibrium trajectory is obtained under a much simpler setting. Such a streamlined presentation should help to highlight the mechanism through which financial frictions cause instability and recurrent fluctuations. Then, we discuss the nature of fluctuations in greater detail when the final goods production function is Cobb-Douglas. For example, the unique steady state possesses corridor stability (locally stable but globally unstable) for empirically relevant parameter values. This also means that, when a parameter change causes the steady state to lose its local stability, its effects are catastrophic and irreversible so that even a small, temporary change in the financial friction could have large, permanent effects on volatility. Other features of the dynamics include an immediate transition from the stable steady state to a stable asymmetric cycle of period n≥. 3, along which n- 1. ≥ 2 consecutive periods of gradual expansion are followed by one period of sharp downturn, as well as to a robust chaotic attractor.

This article examines the approach of LEPs to the low-carbon economy, drawing on documentary analysis and interviews with LEPs and other local economic development actors. It reviews the extent to which LEPs are prioritising low-carbon growth and concludes that, whilst some areas are embedding green growth, progress is highly variable due to uncertainties regarding the national decarbonisation agenda and the lack of an explicit requirement from Government. A lack of consensus regarding what constitutes green growth and a focus by LEPs on large-scale low-carbon projects may be limiting progress in areas, such as energy efficiency, that may deliver multiple economic, environmental and social objectives.

Efforts to examine the relationship have overwhelmingly approached it through the prism of common property and violent offences, or, and to a lesser degree, white-collar crime. As a consequence, appreciation has been impeded of the existence and heightened political significance of diverse and complex connections between a wider array of forms of criminality during times of economic downturn. To demonstrate the value of such connections to the study of the relationship between economic downturn and crime, we draw on the contemporary experience of crisis-hit Greece, where the political importance of associations between corruption, common property and violent offences, and illicit political violence, has made them indispensable components of any account of the linkages between economic downturn and crime in the Greek context. © The Authors 2013.","Common property and violent offences; Corruption; Economic downturn; Financial crisis; Greece; Political violence; Politics of crime","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84882397539"

Drawing on ethnographic data collected at a public high school serving middle-class and affluent youth, I examine the relationship of the school and community environment to students' styles of self-cultivation and aspiration. In particular, I explore values and notions of success - such as freedom of expression, the pursuit of authentic passions, and conventional markers of academic and social achievement - that shape students' forms of self-discipline, self-definition, and aspiration. While arguing that young people's styles of self-cultivation suggest an entitled orientation toward work and life that may promote class privilege, I suggest that they also reflect a neoliberal politics of citizenship-shaping processes of social reproduction through schooling for middle-class youth. This politics of citizenship obligates middle-class youth to 'package' or market authentic personal traits to showcase their exceptional qualities, welt-roundedness, and authentic originality, and to frame such acts in terms of personal choice. Linking such processes of subjectification to political-economic and social conditions, I ultimately argue that middle-class youth bear increasing responsibility for middle-class status. Moreover, I suggest that the pressures resulting from this burden and the ways in which young people negotiate them suggest a domestic politics of 'hyper-vigilance' that may transform young people's self-perceptions, attitudes towards schooling, and aspirations, while also potentially posing risks to youth. © 2008 Pion Ltd and its Licensors.","","California; North America; Silicon Valley; United States; citizenship; class; education; neoliberalism; social status; student; young population","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-65949106588"

Since then it has developed very rapidly into a major industry and makes an important contribution to the country's economy. The government has played a significant part in the development by allocating substantial funds to the promotion of tourism and provision of infrastructure. Less attention has been given to the establishment of sound policies for sustainable tourism and their management. The impact of tourism development on the environment has received insufficient consideration. Added to this, recent economic changes and political events are also having an effect on the international perception of Malaysia as a tourist destination. This chapter will examine the tourism industry in Malaysia. It will also deal with the tourism development in Malaysia, tourist arrivals, tourism products, marketing and promotions, domestic tourism and special issues including the economic downturn beginning in 1997, negative factors affecting tourism in 1997/1998, and the environmental impact of tourism. The causes of the Asian economic downturn and its effects on the tourism industry and the government's plan for tourism development according to The National Economic Recovery Plan, 1998 will also be examined.

The aim of this article is to focus on the governmentalities of these new WTW regimes and to raise provocations for WTW analysts around underlying discourses, framings and power relations within these reforms. Taking the UK Coalition government's WTW programme as its empirical focus, the article emphasises the analytical relevance and leverage of the recent US-focused literature on neoliberal paternalism as well as Foucault's governmentalities framework. In doing so the discussion highlights the need to recognise the discursive and symbolic project of truth (re)creation as a (perhaps the) core part of the Coalition's policy programme with significant and enduring impacts both on the unemployed and social inequality more broadly. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","activation; Foucault; governmentalities; neoliberal paternalism; welfare-to-work","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84904474285"

The aim of this study was to explore the secular trend in happiness among Icelandic adolescents during a period of drastic change in the national economy as well as to identify which groups were most vulnerable and most resilient during the economic crisis. The data used in this study comes from series of population-based surveys of Icelandic adolescents in 2000, 2006, 2009, and 2010. Altogether, a total of 28.484 adolescents participated in the four surveys, representing 84 % of all 14–15 year old adolescents in Iceland. Results indicated that happiness increased by 5 % in the adolescent population from 2000 to 2010 despite the economic crisis. Nevertheless, adolescents who seldom spent time with their parents or perceived difficulties in getting emotional support from parents demonstrated a decrease in happiness. Those who found it easy to get emotional support from parents were happiest at every time point (91–93 %) while those who found it difficult were unhappiest (36–50 %). The association between socio- demographic factors and happiness was explored using multiple linear regression analyses where the year of survey, gender, age, family structure, parent’s education, time spent with parents and emotional support from parents altogether explained 13 % of the happiness variance. Emotional support from parents together with time spent with parents had the largest influence on adolescent’s happiness. An overall increase in time spent with parents was detected which might explain the increase in adolescents´ happiness over time. These results indicate that good relations with parents may protect adolescents from possible negative effect of a national economic crisis. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Adolescents; Economic crisis; Happiness; Social relations; Well-being","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84928665043"

Powerful issues-including health inequities, population aging, globalization, natural disaster, war, and economic downturn-make the need for preventive approaches more critical than ever. Despite social work's historic commitment to enhancing human well-being and public health involvement, little is known about how social work currently views prevention or whether it is being addressed in the social work professional literature. To determine whether, and to what extent, prevention is addressed, discussed, and published in social work journals, the authors-all public health social work researchers - undertook a content analysis of nine peer - reviewed journals, analyzing all articles published from 2000 to 2005. A total of 1,951 articles were reviewed and coded for prevention according to specified criteria. A relatively small number-109 (5.6 percent) - were found to meet the criteria for being a prevention article, suggesting that prevention is still a minority interest area within social work.

Structural equation modeling was used to assess whether psychological distress mediates the associations between economic stressors and the alcohol-related outcomes considered and whether these associations varied by gender. Results: Controlling for correlations among the outcomes and the effects of the sociodemographic control variables, psychological distress was found to partly explain the association between economic stressors and problematic drinking. The mediating effects on problematic drinking were significantly greater for men than women. Conclusions: The fi ndings demonstrate the utility of considering interrelationships among alcohol-related outcomes and, in this context, reveal the circumstances in which gender matters most for understanding the associations among economy-related stressors, psychological distress, and drinking.","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84865013976"

I document this new stylised fact with a panel of data covering over 180 countries and 40 years, using over a dozen measures of protectionism and six of business cycles. I test and reject a number of potential reasons why protectionism is no longer counter-cyclic. A 'diagnosis of exclusion' leads me to believe that modern economics may well be responsible for the decline in protectionism's cyclic behaviour; economists are more united in their disdain for protectionism than virtually any other concept.

Intellectual closure is defined as subtle and hidden forms of constraint on individual agency. Intellectual closure includes calculative thinking about how to publish in flagship journals, avoidance of high-risk projects, and preference for short-term projects with more immediate rewards. Structural constraints, specifically within sociology, are enabling the emergence of narrower perspectives and eroding former professional norms as individual decisions aggregate, unintentionally, to constitute a more competitive discipline with narrower definitions of productivity and quality. © The Author(s) 2012.","higher education; intellectual closure; knowledge; social closure","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84900311040"

The literature is today quite vast, covering both theoretical and empirical aspects. This review concentrates on empirical work, and associated methodologies, concerned with the evaluation of the fragility and resilience of financial and credit markets. The first part of the review examines the literature on systemic risk that arise from banks mutual exposures. These exposures stem primarily from interbank lending and derivative positions, but also, indirectly, from common holdings of other asset classes, that can lead to common shocks in instances of fire sales, and from widespread non-performing loans to the real sector during period of economic downturns. We survey (a) studies that characterize the structure of national interbank networks, in some cases using a multiplex representations, (b) studies that introduce novel methods to quantify systemic risk and identify systemically important institutions, such as via stress test scenarios, (c) studies that assess which regulatory measures can help mitigate the propagation of contagion and distress in the financial system, and (d) studies that explore which location advantages may arise from holding privileged positions in the interbank network, such as via preferential lending relationships, or because of occupying a more central node, and if such advantages can provide an early indication of the build up of systemic risk. The second part of the review is dedicated to the analysis of indirect networks, specifically (e) proximity based network, i.e. networks obtained starting from a proximity measure sometime filtered with a network filtering methodology, (f) association network, i.e. networks where a link between two financial actors is set if a statistical test again a null hypothesis is rejected, and (g) statistically validated networks, i.e. event or relationship networks where a subset of links is selected according to a statistical validation associated with the rejection of a random null hypothesis.

Low-end inequality rises during economic downturns while rising top-end inequality is associated with economic growth. Most countries retreated from redistribution from the mid-1990s until the onset of the Great Recession, and compensatory redistribution in response to rising unemployment was weaker in 2008–2013 than in the first half of the 1990s. As unemployment and poverty risk have become increasingly concentrated among workers with low education, middle-income opinion has become more permissive of cuts in unemployment insurance generosity and income assistance to the poor. At constant generosity, the expansion of more precarious forms of employment reduces compensatory redistribution during downturns because temporary employees do not have the same access to unemployment benefits as permanent employees. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Comparative political economy; income inequality; poverty risk; redistribution; unemployment","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85018181335"

Contamination, economic downturn, depopulation, labor shortage, a damaged reputation, and public distrust must be overcome in order to ensure the future economic recovery of Fukushima. Based on field surveys of the affected areas and unstructured interviews with key informants such as local residents, government officials, and local businesses, this study analyses economic recovery in Fukushima. By exploring four key ""pillar"" areas of Fukushima's economic recovery-renewable energy, manufacturing, agriculture, and tourism-this paper gives an overview of how to rebuild industry in the shadow of nuclear pollution. The results show how the economic recovery in Fukushima has required adaptation and innovation by the local people, and the economic downturn has been reversed and subsequently improved. Across the pillar industries, innovative reconstruction projects have been pioneered and led by local residents and businesses. Fukushima's industrial recovery has been facilitated by the efforts to make the livelihoods of local residents sustainable. It is argued that creative and sustainable economic recovery makes full use of people's and businesses' existing resources to transform the disadvantages caused by disasters into opportunities. © 2019 by the authors.","Adaptive capacity; Economic resilience; Nuclear pollution","Fukushima [Tohoku]; adaptive management; environmental economics; innovation; local participation; nuclear accident; pillar; radioactive waste; reconstruction","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85076693774"

It considers the role of accessibility to external financial resources in shaping decisions undertaken by such enterprises. The hypothesis is that, in a period of economic slowdown, SMEs that have difficulty in accessing external sources of financing adopt different strategies than those that have free access to those resources. The findings indicate that access to the external sources of financing is a statistically significant factor determining decisions of SMEs in relation to employment reduction, price reductions on goods/services, suspension of previously planned investments, and an increase in the level of salaries. Consequently, the study is important as it considers factors that impact the success and survival of SMEs in the emerging market; it is also unique, as it investigates these aspects in the recent period of the global economic downturn. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84903125901"

This degeneration process is countered by some traditional cooperatives that have developed regeneration dynamics.

Limitations on traveling activities have tremendous adverse consequences on a country’s economy, particularly leading in radically expanding economic downturn and a shrinking tourism industry. To overcome this hardship, several countries have eased COVID-19 travel restrictions. However, there are still questions concerning the benefit to society as the impact assessment of this implementation transmitting to an economy has not been explicitly investigated. In response to this, we aim to assess the impacts of this implementation as to provide a guideline to global countries for their future adoption. By calculating the output and household income multipliers from the tourism input–output table, this study utilizes a case study from Thailand to indicate that prolonging the full mobility restrictions of international tourists, which results in a yearly loss of revenue in Thai tourism industry, would cost country production up to 144.97 billion USD and up to 45.4 billion USD for loss of household income. When international travel limitations were relaxed, production and household damage would fall to 142.24 billion USD (+1.88%) and 44.7 billion USD (+1.54%), respectively. At individual sectors level, our calculation identified that the most damage of production activities would exist in public utility, agriculture, and food manufacturing sectors. In the perspective of household income, those in the agricultural sector would have greatest impact. This impact results from the Thai tourism industry positioned as a buyer in an economy, having most impact on sectors selling their products or inputs to the tourism industry. As suggested by the input–output multipliers, we emphasize that strengthening the resilience of tourism-related sectors and reforming the tourism industry in relation to potential consumption and production patterns are critical for sustainable tourism development. © 2022 by the authors.

Unfortunately, earlier research on medium-and long-term impacts of the pandemic on urban and regional systems—with particular reference to the demographic dimension—have not yet reached a consensus on methodological and operational approaches. In the present study, we have applied an interpretative framework to the analysis of the demographic balance in Italy, one of the most affected countries in the world, before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, we have compared a wide set of demographic indicators at two time periods of equal duration (2002–2010 and 2011–2019) and in two subsequent years (2020 and 2021), controlling for the regional context. These periods were chosen as sufficiently long to be representative of differentiated economic dynamics (2002–2010: economic expansion and demographic recovery; 2011–2019: recession and consequent demographic decline). Years 2020 and 2021 were assumed to reflect the shortand medium-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The results of the statistical analysis highlight how the COVID-19 pandemic has exerted considerable pressure on population dynamics, determining short-term (mortality increase), medium-term (more volatile migration flows) and long-term (fertility decline) effects. Future studies should clarify the aggregate role of pandemics in population dynamics as a possible proxy of the decline of demographically fragile regions in advanced economies. © 2022 by the authors.

A resurgence of research on the relationship between economic conditions and crime has occurred in recent years, most of it showing crime increases during economic downturns and declines during recoveries. The so-called Great Recession of 2008-9 broke this pattern; crime rates fell or were flat. Historical scholarship on long-term crime increases during ""price revolutions"" and scattered empirical research on the relationship between short-run changes in crime and inflation suggest that low inflation rates help explain the absence of crime increases during the recent recession. Inflation, net of other economic conditions, had significant effects on homicide, robbery, and burglary rates in several European nations and the United States from the early 1980s to 2010. Inflation may be connected to crime through the dynamics of markets for stolen goods. As prices rise, the demand for cheap stolen goods grows, which strengthens incentives to increase the supply of stolen merchandises. Property crime rates increase. Violent crimes also increase as transactions multiply in ""stateless"" locations beyond the purview of formal authorities.

Given the apparent importance of retrenchment to the survival of small firms for success in economic turmoil, this paper examines the processes of the rightsizing strategies of Chinese-owned small and medium-sized firms in Hong Kong. The research results suggest that SMEs in Hong Kong follow different human resources practices at different stages. In the 'restricting stage', SMEs reduce or stop hiring new staff and restrict overtime for the existing staff to deal with decreases in sales and the oversupply of manpower. In the 'trimming stage', SMEs scale down or streamline their operations. In the 'proactive stage', SMEs employ existing staff in overtime work and start to hire new staff at lower pay but with higher technological competencies to prepare for recovery. A tentative model for rightsizing strategies of Chinese small and medium-sized firms in Hong Kong is proposed.","Asian economic crisis; Chinese owner-managers; Human resources management practices; Rightsizing strategies; Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0344821125"

In spite of that, airports' operating costs did not mirror the traffic trends and kept increasing during the same period, showing evident signs of lack of flexibility. With this background, this paper aims at identifying the drivers of airport cost flexibility in a context of economic recession. This is done by estimating a short-run stochastic cost frontier over a balanced pool database of 194 airports worldwide between 2007 and 2009. Using the total change in cost efficiency during the sample period as a proxy for cost flexibility, the impact of variables such as ownership, outsourcing, airline dominance, low-cost traffic, and revenue diversification is tested in a second-stage regression. Contrary to the existing literature, a higher level of outsourcing is shown to reduce cost flexibility. Results also indicate that low-cost traffic, diversification, and corporatization increase the airports' ability to control costs. The negative impact of airline dominance suggests the need for more stringent regulations on slot allocation at congested airports in order to ensure optimal infrastructure usage. © 2013.","Airport cost function; Cost flexibility; Outsourcing; Stochastic frontier","Air traffic control; Air transportation; Airports; Operating costs; Outsourcing; Stochastic systems; Air cargo; Air travels; Airport cost function; Cost flexibility; Cost-function; Economic downturn; Economic Recession; Global demand; Low-costs; Stochastic frontier; airport; cost-benefit analysis; financial crisis; outsourcing; ownership; stochasticity; transportation economics; Cost functions","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84880329681"

To do so, it offers an account of the long downturn, in terms of the fall and failure of recovery of the profitability, especially in the international manufacturing sector, itself rooted in the rise and persistence of over-capacity and over-production on a system-wide scale, originating in the intensification of international competition between 1965 and 1973. In that context, it finds the source of the current boom in the US in a recovery of manufacturing profitability between 1985 and 1995. But, because the US recovery came heavily at the expense of profitability and economic dynamism elsewhere, leaving the underlying problem of international over-capacity and over-production unresolved, it raises the question of the boom's sustainability, especially in light of the fact that the beginnings of manufacturing recovery in Japan and Germany after 1995 led to the East Asian crisis and new profitability problems in the US. Rapid expansion in the US has thus been driven most recently by fast-growing consumption, rooted in the stock market bubble and the associated growth of debt, so its future remains in doubt.","Economic crisis; Economic history; Economic stagnation; Long wave; US economy; World economy","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0035580324"

However, facing increasing financial pressure during the economic downturn in recent years, they may have limited capital for green investments. In this paper, we investigate, in the presence of limited environmental foundation sizes, whether a pair of co-opetitive supply chain players (consisting of an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) and a Contract Manufacturer (CM) that serves as both a supplier and a competitor in downstream market for the OEM) should co-invest in a joint GTI. We consider two scenarios, Scenario N where the OEM and CM respectively invest in two independent GTIs, and Scenario Y where the two firms co-invest in a joint GTI. We analyze both the exogenous or endogenous reward rates cases for the promoting of green innovation efforts of the GTIs. Under both exogenous and endogenous reward rates, we find that although Scenario Y always yields higher greenness level than Scenario N for both the OEM and CM, the OEM doesn't always have incentive to do so due to the CM's strategic use of wholesale price or reward rate decision responses, while the CM is always better off in Scenario Y when the reward rate is exogenous. We also find that the market size and competitive intensity will post significant impacts on the green innovation outcomes, wholesale price and reward rates decisions in the co-opetitive relationship. Intensified downstream quantity competition can motivate upstream innovation investment. However, greener technology may result in worse environmental performance for the whole supply chain because of increased total quantity. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Co-opetition; Environmental foundation; Green innovation; Green technology innovator; Reward rate","Commerce; Environmental management; Environmental technology; Manufacture; Supply chains; Capital constraints; Contract manufacturers; Environmental performance; Financial pressure; Green consumerisms; Greener technology; Innovation investment; Original equipment manufacturers; Investments","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097094024"

These include community-based programmes, literacy, fundamental education, community development, technical vocational training, extension education, consciousness raising, popular education, and community schooling. With the economic downturn in the 1980s, non-formal education became less viable as part of socio-economic development strategies owing partly to the social progress made in the region, a shift to schooling as a priority and the pulling back of governments from social service funding. Nevertheless, the 1980s saw the informal economy and social movements as emerging avenues for non-formal education programming and non-governmental agencies became the dominant vehicle for educational delivery. During the 1990s, technical education was going through privatisation and adult basic education was being criticised and overhauled. Citizenship education, a potential avenue for non-formal education investment in the newly democratised region is identified as an area overlooked by policy makers. Similarly, the growing needs of the indigenous populations of the region and urban youth unemployment are singled out as potential areas for non-formal education programming.","","Caribbean Islands; Central America; South America; adult education; education; informal sector","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0034004011"

The qualitative aspects relating to funding, stock, physical facilities and application of IT, however, leave much to be desired owing to the economic downturn the country has experienced in the last two decades. The paper recommends that the university sector, and by implication their libraries, should be better funded.

Scant attention has been paid to the political effects of arms transfers on military intervention in Africa. Considering that defense spending may meet the demands of the armed forces, absorb vital social and economic resources needed for development, retard the growth of the civilian domestic product, or strengthen the political position of the military, it is likely that expenditures on arms imports may directly or indirectly affect the likelihood of coups in sub-Saharan African countries. Utilizing theories of arms transfers and coups d'état, a causal model was constructed and data were collected for 35 African nations. An event-count analysis in conjunction with conventional regression techniques was employed for statistical estimation. The findings suggest that arms transfers serve to meet the military's corporate interests and have a longterm direct effect on reducing the likelihood of coups in Africa. However, arms transfers contribute to African regime instability indirectly by enhancing the military's position vis-a-vis civilian institutions in society. Former French colonies have experienced significantly fewer coups than the rest of Africa, but throughout sub-Saharan Africa, countries that experienced an economic downturn or a coup are more likely to have military intervention in politics.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0039835462"

Lack of success may be due more to evolutionary changes in the economic or socio‐technical macrosystem than to local organizational factors. The concept of long waves or Kondratieff cycles can help explain changes in both societal and organizational behaviour and performance. Several long wave theories are briefly reviewed and contrasted. Particular attention is paid to cycles of psychological, social and technological change and innovation. The mutually causal nature of the evolving macro‐system is stressed, but particular attention is paid to macropsychological factors as a basic driving force of the long waves. A rough synthesis of factors contributing to the four phases of the long wave is made. Characteristics of the present downturn are briefly reviewed. Emphasis is placed on the possible mismanagement of advanced information technology.

Within 3 years of their release, almost two thirds of ex-offenders return to prison. Ex-offenders face formidable barriers to employment including legal limitations and those specific to their skills, education, and training. In addition to these real barriers and the stigma associated with having a criminal record, the ex-offender's prospect of securing employment is further complicated by the high national unemployment rate that is characteristic of our current economic downturn. Furthermore, due to limited and or restricted hiring opportunities, ex-offenders may be unable to pursue jobs that best fit their interests. Discussion of the role of work in the lives of ex-offenders has been scarce in the vocational psychology literature. Hence, this article illuminates the ex-offender's reintegration process and the vocational implications of having a criminal record.

The reasons for this foreign labor retention are considered and the authors speculate on future migration trends in the region.-Authors","","Asia; Asia, Western; Case Report; Comparative Study; Demography; Developing Countries; Economics; Emigration and Immigration; Employment; Financial Management; Government; Health Expenditures; Health Manpower; Kuwait; Middle East; Politics; Population; Population Dynamics; Arab Countries; Asia; Case Studies; Comparative Studies; Demographic Factors; Developing Countries; Economic Conditions; Economic Factors; Expenditures; Financial Activities; Government; Human Resources; International Migration; Kuwait; Labor Force; Macroeconomic Factors; Manpower Needs; Migration; Political Factors; Population; Population Dynamics; Western Asia; Arab Countries; article; Asia; case report; Case Studies; Comparative Studies; comparative study; Demographic Factors; demography; developing country; Economic Conditions; Economic Factors; economics; employment; Expenditures; Financial Activities; financial management; government; health care cost; health care manpower; Human Resources; International Migration; Kuwait; Labor Force; Macroeconomic Factors; Manpower Needs; Middle East; migration; Political Factors; politics; population; population dynamics; Western Asia","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0022923029"

This study examines the case of micro firms involved in Terracotta art in Impruneta, Italy, and the extent to which collaboration occurs among the local artisans. In doing so, the study aims to consider collaboration theory in the context of micro firms. Design/methodology/approach: Semi-structured, face-to-face and telephone interviews were conducted among the owners and managers of ten of Impruneta's 16 Terracotta firms. Findings: Whilst much of the academic literature highlights the multiple benefits of collaborative relationships, most participants acknowledge very limited engagement in collaboration. From the comments gathered, two distinct groups emerged, one composed of members of the local Terracotta association, who to some extent collaborate with one another, and the second, the non-members, who pursue their interests individually, or marginally collaborate outside Impruneta. Further, a number of barriers preventing collaboration were identified. Practical implications: The apparent weak collaborative relationships among respondents may have ramifications for the further development of their sector, for instance, restricting innovation and marketing know-how, both of which could help address such external pressures as competition. The involvement of third parties, such as the local town hall or chambers of commerce, was suggested by several participants to help increase collaboration. Originality/value: The study focuses on micro firms, a group that, despite its relevance for many countries' economies, has received limited attention from academic research, including with regard to collaboration and collaboration theory. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Collaboration; Collaboration theory; Impruneta; Italy; Micro firms; Terracotta artisans","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84899618796"

After using scenarios that experimentally manipulated trust and power, our results confirmed the framework’s assumptions regarding the attitudes of the self-employed taxpayers; trust and power fostered intended tax compliance and diminished tax evasion, trust boosted voluntary tax compliance, whereas power increased enforced tax compliance. Additionally, self-employed taxpayers from post-communist countries reported higher intended tax compliance and lower tax evasion than those from non-post-communist countries.

Their importance emerges not only as citizens of contemporary society, but also as citizens of the future society both as participants in democracies and as constituents of the economic labour force. At the same time, young adults are a very vulnerable group that has been particularly affected by the economic downturn. Therefore, young adults’ well-being is increasingly drawing the attention of European policymakers. This paper explores the determinants of SWB of young adults in Europe and examines especially the impact of institutional trust on the overall life satisfaction. Structural equation modelling was used to test main research hypotheses concerning the presence of a positive relation between level of trust and overall life satisfaction once psychological traits, evaluative indicators of specific aspects of life and the other individual characteristics are controlled for.

Design/methodology/approach: An online primary survey of experts from NGOs and public organizations working on immigrant integration in the member states of the European Union was carried out. The data is analyzed using simple comparative statistical methods; the robustness of the results is tested by means of logit and ordered logit statistical models. Findings: The authors find that the general public in Europe has rather negative attitudes towards immigrants. Although the business community views immigrants somewhat less negatively, barriers to immigrant labor market inclusion identified include language and human capital gaps, a lack of recognition of foreign qualifications, discrimination, non-transparent labor markets and institutional barriers such as legal restrictions for foreign citizens. Exclusion from higher education, housing and the services of the financial sector aggravate these barriers. Changes in the areas of salaried employment, education, social insurance, mobility and attitudes are seen as desired by members of ethnic minorities. The current economic downturn is believed to have increased the importance of active inclusion policies, especially in the areas of employment and education. These results appear to be robust with respect to a number of characteristics of respondents and their organizations. Research limitations/implications: The authors' findings are not limited to the sample studied, which is supported by their robustness analysis. However an extended opinion survey of the ethnic minority population is required to more accurately examine the problems faced by diverse groups of immigrants across EU member states. Practical implications: The findings of the study call for more effective diversity management and integration strategies to ensure non-discrimination and better integration of ethnic minorities into the labor markets of member states. Originality/value: There are few studies using primary survey data that have identified a wide range of barriers and challenges to economic integration faced by ethnic minorities in an enlarged European Union.

The sector recognises that to maintain its competitive advantage in both existing and new markets it will require a business strategy focused on product, service and process innovation. The purpose of this paper is to explore how firms within the sector consider how this will impact upon future skills and training needs and identifies where the industry considers the appropriate policy interventions are required. Design/methodology/approach: A survey was undertaken to explore how innovation and technology adoption within the agri-food and drinks sector is impacting on educational and skills requirements. In total, 30 companies were interviewed, providing representation from all the food and drinks sub-sectors and covering at least 50 per cent of employee numbers in each sub-sector. The survey focuses on current and future skills requirements for specific cohorts of employees in the sector; specifically those who have undertaken further full-time training beyond minimum school leaving age. In addition, it aimed to seek employer feedback on those entering the labour market for the first time. Findings: The results support the need for strong intermediate levels of educational attainment. In addition, the acquisition of work-related generic skills is essential for creating a more ""flexible"" and multi-skilled workforce. Up-skilling programmes, particularly for lower to mid-level management roles, will become increasingly important in the future. Experience gained through work placement and vacation and weekend work is viewed very positively. Companies expressed a greater need for engagement between the further and higher education sectors and industry in relation to the content, design and delivery of educational programmes to adequately meet the needs of the sector. Originality/value: At a time when government is looking to growth in the private sector to stimulate economic growth in the wider economy, this paper highlights the skills and training challenges which have emerged within the Northern Ireland agri-food sector, in response to business strategies which are more focused on product, service and process innovation. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Agri-food sector; Education and skills; Innovation; Northern Ireland","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84898489480"

Previous literature has examined the emergence of new housing movements as a direct consequence of the economic and social challenges that arose as a result of the economic downturn and neoliberal austerity policies. However, there is, as yet, little that addresses the ways autonomous housing groups engage in non-violent direct action and the challenges they face in trying not just to promote a radical change of policy but also in carrying out practical prefigurative action.

A total of 848 respondents were asked in 2017 to 2020 by means of stratified selection. There was a significant decrease of preferences of respondents in all investigated motivation factors. Testing confirmed the existence of statistically significant differences during 2020 in comparison with previous years in investigating the following motivation factors: basic salary, job security, good working team, communication at work and superior's approach. The main contribution of the research is the finding that pandemic COVID-19 has the influence except of other impacts also on the area of employee motivation. © 2021 The Author(s).

He argues that change has been so slow and limited that the transition could be considered the ""consolidation of the 1973 counterrevolution."" Politically, the Concertación has been hobbled by the Constitution of 1980, which guarantees legislative overrepresentation to the right that, in turn, prevents modification of the constitution to eliminate its undemocratic provisions. Moreover, the courts remain packed with Pinochet appointees, and in important areas the military has removed itself from civilian authority. Thus, Nef finds that Chile during the transition ""presents the paradox of a legitimate government presiding over an illegitimate state."" In addition to these political constraints, he identifies other sources of the structural weakness of the Concertación. Privatization of state industries and social services has not only limited the sphere of government action but also eroded the social weight of the professional and middle-class voters who constitute much of the Concertación's base. More significant, the working class has not been able to reconstitute itself as a political and social force. Restrictive labor legislation and a high degree of contingent and informal unemployment have kept unionization levels low and prevented the reemergence of a powerful national labor confederation like the precoup Central Única de Trabajadores (Unitary Federation of Workers-CUT), which mobilized workers politically and channeled their collective demands into the political process. In contrast, corporate interests, grouped into influential associations and buttressed by ties to the military, right-wing parties, and transnational capital, have become ""a hegemonic business class stronger than the state itself."" He also highlights the continued importance of the military's monopoly of force, which it has wielded repeatedly to influence government action. Among additional roadblocks to democracy identified by Nef are rightist control of the mass media and the Concertación's elitist political practices, topics that are considered in more depth by other contributors to this issue. Nef concludes that the prospects of Chilean neoliberalism are more secure than those of expanded democracy. On one hand, the electoral strength of the right is growing, as was demonstrated by Lagos's narrow victory over Lavín in the 2000 runoff election. On the other, should the confluence of unmet social needs and economic downturn precipitate a leftist upsurge from the base, the extreme right could once again sacrifice democracy to the preservation of its privileges.","","Chile; democratization; neoliberalism; political reform; social policy","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-0141855091"

The study goes beyond the neoclassical explanation of entrepreneurship and adopts a more eclectic approach that considers economic, historical, political, sociocultural, and external factors. The essay concludes that Igbo entrepreneurship surged in the post-Biafra period because of factors inherent in the Igbo society and culture and because of the political and economic realities that the Igbos face in Nigeria. Because of the spontaneous nature of its emergence, Igbo entrepreneurship is less sensitive to shocks such as wars, economic downturns, and political instability.

In this model, price-cost margins in a global loan market are endogenous and countercyclical. As a result, a positive TFP shock in one country spills over to another through a reduction in the global cost of both credit and externally financed investment. The quantitative analysis shows that countercyclical margins on loans play a key role in bringing the predictions of the theory closer to the observed cross-country cyclical co-movements of consumption, employment, investment and output. Recessions are deeper when the cost of credit rises during these economic downturns. Thus, a financial accelerator arises in our framework, unveiling the increased importance of stabilization policies in economies where margins in credit markets are countercyclical. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Unlike during the Great Depression of the 1930s, politicians have not resorted to protectionist measures to try to contain the downturn. The response has been just the opposite, with the dominant discourse arguing that in times of austerity and private deleveraging, trade liberalisation is indispensable for restoring growth. Adopting a historical-institutionalist perspective, we argue that the crisis has had an asymmetric effect on the two most important subsystems of EU trade policy. On the one hand, the EU took a leap forward on the path of bilateral free trade liberalisation by starting negotiations with the US, Canada and Japan. On the other hand, proposals to continue with permissive reforms for the adoption of trade defence measures and to give the EU more leverage vis-à-vis emerging economies have been blocked. We thus conclude that EU trade policy after the crisis has shown asymmetric continuity, where the liberalisation trend has been resumed more radically while accompanying defensive reforms to ease the potential pain of liberalisation have run into a stalemate. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","crisis; EU trade policy; international procurement; trade defence measures; TTIP","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84961762751"

Others have noted that this has led to the shortening of product life cycles (Tassey, 2000), and the greater importance of innovation in order to retain competitiveness (Smith, 2002; Huggins and Izushi, 2007). These are the environments where entrepreneurs are traditionally felt to thrive, be this in starting their own firms, working within larger corporations, or in their lives in general (Gibb, 2002b; Rae, 2010). This ensures that the need for entrepreneurial skills is greater than ever (Taatila, 2010), with higher education seen as having a key role in providing the necessary entrepreneurial and employability skills (Crayford et al., 2012; Thompson et al., 2010; 2012). There is, however, no consensus on the best way to develop these skills, if it is possible at all (Jack and Anderson, 1999). Although the traditional classroom environment may be effective in providing students with basic business skills that constitute the 'science' component of entrepreneurship it is often felt to be unsuitable for teaching the 'art' component associated with innovation and creativity (Jack and Anderson, 1999; Pretorius et al., 2005). Rae (2006) notes the personal and social emergence of an individual forming their own identity and mindset as an entrepreneur as part of this learning experience. With traits such as self-confidence and willingness to tolerate uncertainty found by studies such as Baron (2000) and van Praag and Cramer (2001) to be positively associated with successful entrepreneurs, authors such as Johannisson (1991) and Jones and English (2004) see the creation of these traits as being the primary purpose of entrepreneurship education. Gibb's (2002a) notion of conductive entrepreneurial environment points to the importance of providing an all-round student entrepreneurship learning experience that meets the rigours of academia, while keeping an experientially-based approach that enhances creativity and innovation (Gibb, 2002a; Porter and McKibbin, 1988). Pretorius et al. (2005) and Löbler (2006), however, suggest that the everyday pressures associated with the classroom environment and behaviourist forms of teaching make it difficult for students to shift into a more creative, less constrained way of thinking. This exploratory study examines the potential benefits of an entrepreneurship boot camp at the end of an academic year aimed at allowing students the opportunity to participate in multidimensional entrepreneurship activities and discussions in a less formal environment. Although all of the students will have been exposed to similar activities as part of their courses and extra curricular activities, without the appropriate environment, it is possible that fewer benefits will be received (Taatila, 2010). Taatila and Vyakarnam (2008) note the important role the mentor plays in creating this environment, but others (e.g. Heap, 1996; West, 2004; Pretorius et al., 2005) note the role played by the physical environment The students' perceptions of the environment created and the evidence of changes in how students think about entrepreneurship as an activity and of themselves within these roles are examined. In thinking about the boot camp experience, the students also reveal some of the limitations of the traditional classroom environment. In order to achieve this, the study takes an in-depth longitudinal approach with interviews held with the participating students at a number of points before, during, and after the boot camp. This enables the study to examine how students' attitudes evolve throughout the learning experience. The results suggest that an informal environment away from campus aids creative thinking, as students expressed an appreciation of the opportunity to discuss their ideas in a more open manner to obtain greater feedback from mentors and peers. The students' responses suggested that the displacement from the campus environment was of great benefit here. Students explicitly noted the way they could consider their business ideas as new ventures rather than being concerned with making comparisons with previous studies for purposes of assessment. In relation to the need to aid students' development of social and psychological skills highlighted by Taatila (2010), being away from the pressures of the educational environment meant students were better able to develop their own identities as entrepreneurs. It appears therefore that the boot camp's multidimensional nature produces different outcomes to those of other experiential- learning approaches, thus providing another piece of the jigsaw to the conductive entrepreneurial environment puzzle. The camps therefore potentially improve the creative entrepreneurial attributes of graduates. Studies such as Taatila (2010) suggest that these skills are expected to increase graduates' value as business owners or employees in other firms. Implications for entrepreneurial learning both within the university and corporate environments may be that whilst entrepreneurial learning may rely on contextual experience (Rae, 2006; Politis, 2008), it appears that there can be considerable benefits where reflection can be undertaken, and development negotiated, away from the front line of assessed academic work or in the case of firms, production. Interviews after completion of the study suggest that although actual activities undertaken after such camps may be coloured by the return of day-today pressures, an entrepreneurial mind-set remains. © 2012 The Braybrook Press Ltd.","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84873348029"

Our study employs newly constructed financial condition indices that incorporate banking variables extensively.

The LVSTAR model allows for non-linear dynamics and regime changes between low and high stress regimes. It can also replicate the regime-specific amplification effects shown by our theoretical model. The amplification effects, however, change over time. Specifically after the Lehman collapse, we observe the presence of strong non-linearities and amplification mechanisms for some euro area countries. Thus, these strong amplification effects appear to be related to rare but large events, and to a low-frequency financial cycle. Prior to the financial crisis outbreak we find corridor stability even if the financial sector shock takes place in a high stress regime. More important seems to be the shock propagation over time in the economy. Only with the occurrence of rare but large events we find strong endogenous feedback loops and a loss of stability as described by the high stress regime of our theoretical model. The economy leaves the corridor of stability and is prone to adverse feedback loops. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","E2; E44; Euro area; Financial cycle; Financial stress; G01; Real economy; Regime-switching; Vector STAR","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84954440545"

Following this idea, the author draws on Joan Acker's “ideal worker” concept to demonstrate how pandemic disparities in the workforce are challenging organizational practices, expectations, and experiences worldwide to evolve. This article concludes with a call for workplace policy reforms as a means to advance gender parity goals, as it is critical to achieving organizational inclusivity, and overall, a thriving society and economy post-pandemic. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Covid-19; gender; ideal worker; inequality; organization","COVID-19; gender issue; health risk; policy reform; womens employment; womens health","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85119894682"

After reviewing states' aggregate reaction to the economic downturn, we conduct an original analysis of the recession's budgetary impact on the states and their policy responses. Economic factors such as falling personal income and home values explain much of the variation in the recession's impact. State budgeting rules and practices conditioned states' experiences, but not always as intended: budget gaps were smaller in states with stricter balanced budget requirements, but larger in states with statutory spending limitations. Personal income tax increases were more likely in states with a Democratic legislature or greater public unionization rates, while midyear spending cuts were smaller in states with larger public sector unions. In sum, we find that while states' objective economic situations determined the bulk of their responses to the Great Recession, political factors determined these responses' shape and form. © American Academy of Political & Social Science 2013.","Great Recession; political economy of institutions; public finance; state politics","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84884565903"

Two nation-wide samples of vacationers are used: one during a downturn, the other one at the start of the recovery period. Through comparing the results, conclusions can be drawn about symmetric or asymmetric tourist demand across the business cycle. The main summer holiday has an asymmetric profile: being fairly crisis-resistant during a recession and showing considerable growth during an expansion. This does not apply to short vacations and day trips, each having a symmetric profile: during a recession they experience substantial reductions and during expansion comparable growth. So when talking about tourist demand in general, one cannot say that it is symmetric or asymmetric across the business cycle: it depends on the type of vacation. Differences in tourist demand are best explained by the role of Quality-of-Life for vacationers. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","(a)symmetric tourist demand; business cycle; income elasticity; quality of life; tourism marketing","business cycle; demand analysis; income; quality of life; tourism market; tourist behavior","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85026732770"

Yet, in many places widespread degradation (caused by overgrazing) severely threatens the natural resource base and prospects for future food security and sustainable development. On Samothraki, a Greek island, several decades of continuous increase of the local livestock population, exceeding not only the local food base by far but also the local farmers’ ability to provide supplementary feed, led to a socio-ecological tipping point turning the dynamics downward. Still, in the face of very restricted marketing opportunities, we find local farmers in an economic deadlock of relying on CAP subsidies as a main source of income and on still too high animal numbers for maintaining an ecological balance of their land while lacking the labor power (due to large-scale migration to Germany in the 1950s and 60 s) to apply adequate management practices. In this paper, we present a feed balance (feed-demand and supply) for sheep and goats from 1970 to 2012 and discuss causes and effects of the excessive growth in animal numbers, as well as reasons for their downturn in the last decade. We describe the island's groundcover and symptoms of soil degradation, and underline our findings by reference to a remote sensing approach. Our findings recently gained in prominence as in September 2017, a state of emergency had to be declared on the island when a major weather event triggered a series of landslides that severely damaged the main town, a number of roads and bridges and even the 700 years old Fonias Tower, a marker of Samothraki tourism. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Agricultural subsidies; Island studies; Local sustainability; Mediterranean; Overgrazing; Social metabolism; Stock-flow relations; Tipping points in socioecological systems","Aegean Islands; Eastern Macedonia and Thrace; Evros; Greece; Mediterranean Region; Samothrace; Animalia; Capra hircus; Ovis aries; agricultural policy; ground cover; landslide; metabolism; overgrazing; soil degradation; subsidy system; sustainability","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85046350397"

Significant changes are found in the socio-economic as well as urban form and location correlates of travel during the period. The importance of location in explaining travel distances has increased over time. It is suggested that the effects may be explained as cost reducing strategies on behalf of consumers which would lead to an increasing importance of distance to nearest facilities/destinations. It follows that the location pattern, the geographical configuration of the urban region, is a factor in households' adaptive strategies which partly determine the possibilities for reducing travel and the possibilities for adaption and regional resilience. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Accessibility; Copenhagen; Financial crisis; Foreclosure crisis; Location; Travel distances; Urban form; Urban region","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84947037989"

Identifying tax variation comes from changes in federal corporate tax laws that heterogeneously and, due to the simultaneity of state and federal corporate taxes, automatically affect state-level tax laws. Instrumental variables regressions indicate that a 1% increase in R&D tax incentives causes a statistically significant 2.8–3.8% increase in R&D. Alternatively, ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions of R&D expenditures on R&D tax incentives, which do not correct for the policy endogeneity of R&D tax incentives, indicate that a 1% increase in R&D tax incentives causes a statistically insignificant 0.4–0.7% increase in R&D. One possible explanation for these results is that tax policies are implemented before an economic downturn. ©, This work was authored as part of the Contributor’s official duties as an Employee of the United States Government and is therefore a work of the United States Government.

Because of this, the economic downturn is also seen as an opportunity to speed up the sustainability transition or, in simple terms, to achieve a “green recovery”. What can we expect from a green recovery? We address this question by reviewing position documents in the debate between green recovery and its opponent, “quick rebound”, in the Netherlands. We apply systems thinking to model causal arguments regarding key concepts comprising green recovery and identify issues of consensus and dissensus. Our findings indicate that green recovery is promising for curbing greenhouse gas emissions and addressing growing socioeconomic inequalities. However, the position of what green recovery means for economic growth, including the development of gross domestic product and employment, is still largely unclear and at times contradictory. While some see tradeoffs, others suggest that economic growth and sustainability goals can be achieved simultaneously.

While the regime claims to have taken significant steps toward democracy, close examination of the current political landscape reveals a very different picture. The press is neither free nor plural. The ruling party continues to monopolise politics while the opposition languishes. Opposition deputies entered parliament in 1994, but parliament's marginal political role minimises the significance of its newly plural make-up for democratisation. Similarly, Ben Ali has raised the policy-making profile of the Economic and Social Council, the composition of which is quite plural; still, its effective power over policy is insubstantial. Ironically, Ben Ali's reforms appear to be making the ruling party's exercise of power more efficient. By allowing more voices to be heard in politically weak institutions in debates that are neither open nor reported to the public, the regime can test the political waters for new policy initiatives and more accurately gauge the state of public opinion. Authoritarian continuity should not be understood solely as a response to Islamist mobilisation, for the Tunisian ruling party has never tolerated rivals. As long as the economy performs reasonably well, regime stability is assured. But in the event of a downturn, the lack of peaceful mechanisms for public, popular articulation of dissent means that over the medium to long term instability could loom on Tunisia's horizon.","","Tunisia; national politics; party politics; political reform; political system","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0033281476"

Even those who have not contracted the virus have experienced its far-reaching impacts, particularly on their mental health. The increased incidences of psychological problems, anxiety associated with the infection, social restrictions, economic downturn, etc., are likely to aggravate with the virus spread and leave a longer impact on humankind. These reasons in aggregation have raised concerns on mental health and created a need to identify novel precursors of depression and suicidal tendencies during COVID-19. Identifying factors affecting mental health and causing suicidal ideation is of paramount importance for timely intervention and suicide prevention. This study, thus, bridges this gap by utilizing computational intelligence and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to unveil the factors underlying mental health issues. We observed that the pandemic and subsequent lockdown anxiety emerged as significant factors leading to poor mental health outcomes after the onset of COVID-19. Consistent with previous works, we found that psychological disorders have remained pre-eminent. Interestingly, financial burden was found to cause suicidal ideation before the pandemic, while it led to higher odds of depressive (non-suicidal) thoughts for individuals who lost their jobs.

However, the economic downturn has already restricted those sources of funding, and public sector spending cuts are likely to restrict them even further. This paper discusses a case-study research on the impact that recession and spending cuts have had on the way BIDs operate, and identifies the threats and opportunities to them as stakeholder-led instruments for the management of town centres and commercial and industrial areas. The research shows that although the recession and spending cuts have had an impact on most BIDs, the model itself has not been put in question, and BIDs are becoming permanent features of the governance of town and city centres, and increasingly also of industrial areas. Their roles in public realm management have been varied, from a minor function in complementing local environmental services, to being active players in the transformation of public places into arenas for festivals and spectacle, to coordinators of surveillance, policing and occasionally exclusion. The implications for the public realm of the evolution and consolidation of BIDs will therefore be varied. Some BIDs are likely to play an increasing role in the delivery of public realm services and the shaping of public realm quality, and in those cases the existence of adequate mechanisms to harmonise the interests of levy payers with other local stakeholders will be of considerable importance. Others might have a sporadic impact on the public realm, with a more pronounced role of the local authority in mediating that impact. Understanding how BIDs operate, the aspirations they represent, their relationship to other aspirations and to broader policy objectives, and the role in that operation of fluctuations in the economy, will be increasingly important in thinking critically about the limits and potential of emerging forms of urban governance. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Business Improvement Districts; Public realm governance; Public spending cuts; Recession; Town centres; Urban management","England; United Kingdom; business development; governance approach; industrial enterprise; public sector; stakeholder","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84860837641"

However, the recent economic crisis has caused large losses in employment for both women and men, potentially yielding unexpected consequences for the evolution of work–family arrangements. This article carries out a comparative analysis of the relationship between the 2008/2009 economic crisis and work–family arrangements in Europe. Using data for six countries from the European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions, this article fills a gap in the literature by addressing three issues: (1) whether work–family arrangements have changed from before to after the beginning of the economic downturn in countries with different gender and welfare regimes (Germany, Greece, Spain, France, Sweden and the United Kingdom), (2) whether changes in work–family arrangements have occurred at different levels of the social strata and (3) whether couples have moved from dual-earner to male- or female-breadwinner. The results indicate changes in work–family arrangements in those countries worst hit by the economic crisis, Greece and Spain, where dual-earner and male-breadwinner households have decreased and no-earner and female-main-earner households have increased. Moreover, the results show that in these two countries, all social strata – proxied through women’s level of education – have been affected by the crisis. In contrast, only moderate changes in work–family arrangements among all women can be observed in countries less hit by the economic downturn. The findings for the two southern European countries are troubling, as the increases in no-earner and female-breadwinner households point to worsening economic conditions throughout the population and to a halt in the process that for several decades had been leading to more equality in the distribution of employment between genders. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","Economic crisis; Europe; female employment; women’s education; work–family arrangements","France; Germany; Greece; Spain; Sweden; United Kingdom; economic instability; European Union; female education; financial crisis; gender relations; labor participation; womens employment; adult; article; education; employment; European Union; female; France; gender; Germany; Greece; household; human; human experiment; male; Spain; statistics; Sweden; United Kingdom; welfare","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85031742444"

Following a discussion of the changes to the economy and the expected skills for employment that have resulted from the advent of the Internet, this article presents the services that libraries are providing to help patrons transition to this new economy. Drawn from the findings of the 2011-2012 Public Library Funding and Technology Access Study (PLFTAS) survey and site visits to public libraries, the data demonstrate the changes in job skills and employment-seeking services since the beginning of the ongoing prolonged economic downturn and the breadth and depth of the electronic information services that libraries currently provide to users. Designed to meet the needs of the local communities that libraries serve, these services rely on the capacities of the Internet, public access technologies, and Internet-enabled services provided by the library. This article concludes with a discussion of the ways in which this research can inform broader explorations of the relationships between libraries, the Internet, the new economy, and twenty-first-century skills. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","demand for services; Great Recession; recession impact on public libraries; research effect on library policy; services demand","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84866328636"

Second, surviving firms from the 2006 cohort positively affected employment, as their annual job creation was higher than the reduction in employment caused by exiting firms.

Among respondents aged 40-64 and looking for work, 66% reported CRN in 2008, and 41% did not fill a prescription due to cost pressures. More than half of respondents aged 40-64 and nearly two-thirds of those in this group who were looking for work or disabled reported other impacts of medication costs, such as cutting back on basic needs or increasing credit card debt. More than one-third of respondents aged 65+ who were working or looking for work reported CRN. Regardless of age or employment status, roughly half of respondents reporting medication cost hardship said that these problems had become more frequent in 2008 than before the economic recession.

We theorize that Justices are akin to voters in political elections; specifically, we posit that the Justices will view short-term and relatively minor economic downturns-recessions-as attributable to the failures of elected officials, but will consider long-term and extreme economic contractions-depressions-as the result of exogenous shocks largely beyond the control of the government. Accordingly, we predict two patterns of behavior in economic-related cases that come before the Court: (1) in typical times, when the economy cycles through both recessionary and prosperous periods, the Justices will punish the elected branches of government when the economy contracts by voting less frequently for the government; and (2) in atypical times, when the economy moves into a period of deep depression, the Justices will work with the other branches of government by voting more frequently for the government. We test our hypotheses through statistical analysis of taxation opinions rendered by the Supreme Court during the period from 1913 to 1929 (a relatively normal period) and the period from 1930 to 1940 (the Great Depression). We find broad support for our hypothesis in the data we analyze, and we verify that our results are robust to a change in the measure of the economic condition as well as to a change in the specification of the regression model. We conclude that U.S. Supreme Court Justices exhibit voting patterns similar to voters in political elections when it comes to the economy.

Most prior research on firm strategies largely neglect the business cycle. We use data on a large sample of Spanish manufacturing firms from 1994 to 2014. In this period, the Spanish economy experienced a boom period (1994–2008) and a bust period involving a severe economic crisis (2009–2014). Our study highlights the important role of each stage of the economic cycle. Specifically, with respect to product diversification, our findings show that in a boom, moderate diversifiers obtain better profitability levels than their highly diverse or limited diversification counterparts do. In contrast, during an economic downturn, moderate and high diversifiers can be equally effective up to some point of optimization. Our findings also reveal a negative and significant effect of internationalization on profitability, independent of the stage of the economic cycle. Product and international diversification are complementary strategies during a period of economic growth when firms opt for moderate levels of product diversification. Meanwhile, when firms choose high levels of product diversification, both types of strategies are complementary during the boom cycle, but substitutive during the bust cycle. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Economic cycle; Firm performance; International diversification; Product diversification; Spanish manufacturing firms","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85069736520"

The goal is to further the knowledge of the anatomy of resource downturn and, more importantly, its extended implications in an arctic economy. Contrary to the stylized representations, the paper argues that Yukon's economy is particularly vulnerable to fluctuations in population number and structure, in addition to the resource sector itself. Specifically, the major impact of a resource downturn on regional economy is found in induced effects related to demographic shifts (aging and depopulation) in the household sector followed by changes in consumption. This article demonstrates that high-tech and high-salary industries, and services (most favorable for the future of the region) suffer the most from population loss and aging. To trace these impacts the study utilizes several variants of single-region IO models, including extended demoeconomic IO model known as the Batey-Madden or Type IV framework. In our formulation, this model emphasizes age-specific consumption and is designed to track induced changes in sectoral gross outputs resulting from income and demographic shifts. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.","","Canada; Yukon Territory; computer simulation; demographic trend; economic analysis; economic conditions; financial crisis; income distribution; input-output analysis; mining industry; modeling; population structure; regional economy","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-77954837805"

The results indicate fairly substantial employment problems. Although approximately one-half (55.6%) of the single mothers had adequate employment, 30% experienced unemployment or involuntary job gaps, and approximately 15% experienced underemployment. Results further indicate that age, education level, past work experience, and homeownership are related to a reduced risk of employment problems. On the other hand, work disability, other family income, receipt of cash benefits, and state unemployment rates place single mothers at an increased risk of unemployment and underemployment.

By design, non-linear models inherently include interactions, and as a result the interaction coefficient does not capture the full extent and complexity of the interaction effect. After exploring the complexities of interaction effects in non-linear models, we outline methods to estimate and understand the interaction effects in two widely used marketing models. We use 26 years of weekly US movie market data to test the interactions between critics' ratings and consumer sentiment about economic conditions on box office attendance.

Furthermore, to explore the mechanisms through which smoking could be affected we focus on the role of labor-market changes.

Two outcomes are explored: smoking participation and smoking intensity, using pooled ordinary least squares (OLS) and linear probability models. The detected reduction in both outcomes is not explained by the changes in labor-market variables. Other factors in the demand function for tobacco play a more important role.

Based on household micro data, trends in poverty among children, large families and single parents are presented for two data points: one before and one after the restrictive reforms in family policies. The focus of the analysis is on changes in the effectiveness of benefits on child poverty reduction. Child poverty increased during the observed period in all three countries, despite the efforts of governments to smooth the harmful effects of the economic downturn. Large differences in poverty levels and patterns between the three countries persisted. A relative worsening of the income position of children was accompanied by an increased level of targeting, reflected in general attempts to exclude higher-income groups from the benefit regimes. The results in the paper suggest that social transfers in general, and family benefits in particular, contributed to reduce significantly child poverty in the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland. However, reduction rates decreased between the early and the later 1990s. Current and future reform considerations should therefore include the objective to reverse this trend.","Central and Eastern Europe; Poverty; Social transfers; Transition economies","Czech Republic; Hungary; Poland; child; low income population; poverty alleviation; social policy; social security","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0035210213"

However, what is meant by the term varies radically, and the contributors here, through compelling and wide ranging essays, identify the strengths and weaknesses of current definitions and their deployment in the social sciences. By developing their own rigorous and innovative theory of human sociality, they re-set the framework of the debate and open up new possibilities for conceptualizing other forms of sociality, such as that of animals or materials. Cases from Asia, Africa, the Americas and Europe explore the new directions of human sociality, illuminating how and why it is transformed when human beings engage with such major issues as economic downturn, climate change, new regimes of occupational and psychological therapy, technological innovations in robotics and the creation of new online, 'virtual' environments.

The economic downturn in the forest economy in Kenora, Ontario in the 2000s opened pathways for new collaborative partnerships to emerge in governance systems that include industry and local, provincial, federal and First Nations governments. In order to enhance our collective understanding of collaborative governance in the forest sector we set out to describe the institutions and institutional changes that made cross-cultural collaboration possible and explain cross-cultural collaboration in terms of meta-governance (values, norms, and principles), particularly in relation to substantive decision-making. Using a review of policy and management documents and semi-structured interviews with governance actors, we examined regional shifts in tenure, the governance system of a leading example of collaboration, and procedures, processes, and organizational structures that helped establish equal decision-making authority that facilitated collaborative relationships. We found that tenure reforms allowed for structural changes in the governance system for the Kenora Forest, these led to formal partnerships between First Nations and industry, and the new governance system involved power sharing in decision-making authority. Conclusions of the work include that future tenure reforms should continue to promote collaboration in the region, and that the case study represents a novel type of collaboration between industry and First Nations in Canada. © 2016.","Canada; Cross-cultural collaboration; First Nations; Forests; Governance; Land tenure policy","Decision making; Forestry; Canada; Cross-cultural collaboration; First nations; Forests; Governance; Land tenure; Industrial economics","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84963509954"

Some people think that such a welfare state is a dystopia to be avoided at all costs. Others believe the Nordic welfare state is a paradise on earth. Both critics and supporters agree that the Nordic countries share a number of features that in a catch-all term can be said to be ‘the Nordic welfare model’ with a distinct set of goals, policies, and outcomes. The goal of equality, most notably between rich and poor and between men and women, constitutes a beacon of hope for egalitarian thinking in many countries. At the same time other observers see the same phenomena, equality, as at odds with efficiency. The big trade-off between equality and efficiency, as aptly labelled by neo-classical economist Arthur Okun (1975) nearly 40 years ago. Okun believed that providing generous benefits to people will result in economic inefficiencies as compared to a situation without such benefits. The other perspective is that benefits nurture the economy, most notably through social investments, by mitigating the detrimental effects of economic downturns and by stimulating productive but risk-based economic behaviour (Myrdal, 1960; Kuusi, 1964). In this chapter we focus on the principles, policies, and outcomes in the Nordic welfare state. In the next section we introduce the goals of the Nordic model in terms of key principles like universality and inequality and describe how these principles were first instigated in policies and what challenges they are said to confront in the 2010s. In the following section we analyse policy outcomes in a number of central areas from a comparative perspective. In the concluding section we assess these policy developments and welfare outcomes in view of current challenges in a discussion of the future for the Nordic welfare model in the Nordic countries and in other countries. In this section we present the goals of the Nordic welfare model and the policies used to try to achieve these goals. We focus on key concepts of inequality and social mobility on the side of goals and outcomes, and we focus on concepts like universalism and generosity when setting out the policy side. We briefly look into the roots and development of these concepts. © 2013 Bent Greve. All rights reserved.","","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85087721100"

This typically results in a pattern of retrenchment and rationalisation designed to cut costs. Responses of this kind may be justifiable and, to varying degrees, effective at a firm-level. However, their wider repercussions can include the worsening of a pre-existing economic downturn (e.g. large- scale redundancies affecting local communities and cancelled orders affecting other firms in the supply chain).Whenfaced with an economic crisis, some firms adopt a more entrepreneurial approach, in which the key features are strategic reappraisal and various forms of product, process and organisational innovation (Filippetti and Archibugi, 2011). While large corporations are capable of this kind of transformation, there is an increasing recognition of the important part that smaller entrepreneurial firms can play in innovation (Christensen, 1997) including the reinvigoration of industry sectors through open innovation (Chesbrough, 2003) and contributing to the reconfiguration of geographic clusters (Best, 2001). Studies of long wave cycles have shown that periods of economic crisis and depression can be important for innovation: they can disrupt established industry structures and cause entrepreneurs to see markets and customers in a different light so that they re-think products and services (Barras, 2009). However, comparatively little attention has been directed to considering just how entrepreneurial individuals in smaller firms mobilise the resources necessary for innovation and cope with risk in the unfavourable and demanding conditions that prevail in times of economic crisis. This exploratory study seeks to address this research gap. It does so through an in-depth historical case study of the contrasting responses of two firms, in the same industry sector but operating on different scales with differing modes of production (i.e. artisanal v. mechanised), to the greatest economic crisis of the 20th century, namely, the Great Depression of the 1930s (Crafts and Fearon, 2011). The two firms, which served the same markets and were affected by the same external forces, followed very different paths: the larger one engaged in a series of acquisitions as a means of rationalising production and cutting costs, while the much smaller firm that operated on a very modest scale chose to innovate. This innovation involved developing a product that was new to Britain at the time, namely the sousaphone, an unorthodox musical instrument that hitherto had only been produced in the United States. As well as comparing the activities of the two firms operating on different scales, the study examines why the owners of this small firm decided to innovate in the very difficult trading conditions that prevailed at the time, and exactly how they were able to acquire and mobilise the resources needed to pursue this path. In particular, the study focuses on the use of improvisation (Kamoche, Cunha and Cunha, 2002), that is to say 'impromptu action' (Dickson, 1997: p. 37), and the closely related concept of entrepreneurial 'bricolage' (Baker and Nelson, 2005; Phillips and Tracey, 2007) or 'making do' (Eisenberg, 1990: p. 154), as a means of accessing the resources required. The findings suggest that while large-scale enterprises often concluded that a strategy of retrenchment and rationalisation was the appropriate response to economic crisis, firms operating on a smaller scale viewed the situation differently and responded to the altered trading conditions in more positive, creative and entrepreneurial ways. As a result they were able to identify opportunities associated with new and expanding markets with scope for innovation. The study provides insights into the ways in which these small firms were able to identify and access the necessary resources for their innovations. It also sheds new light on the improvisatory nature of their entrepreneurial response, and its capacity to overcome seemingly insurmountable obstacles to growth in a recessionary environment (e.g. adapting existing resources to new uses, forming unconventional subcontracting arrangements and turning existing skills to new uses). The paper concludes with a summary of the key findings and their implications for future research and practice. © 2014 The Braybrooke Press Ltd.","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84918825774"

The global economic downturn in the late 1920s led states to embrace protectionist measures such as heightened tariffs and import quotas, all designed to protect local industries and maintain a favorable trade balance. The introduction of such measures, however, often resulted in the emergence of highly profitable illicit circuits, including in the borderland between Turkey and Syria. Here, a sturdy coalition of producers, shop owners, smugglers, trackers, and peddlers began to smuggle into Turkey a range of goods from silk textiles to cigarette papers, while funneling out narcotics into Syria. By seeking the global trajectories of such commodity flows, this article examines the impact of these borderland mobilities on the making of Turkey's southern border by exploring the local and bureaucratic responses to a rapidly changing world economic order in the aftermath of the Great Depression. © 2020 Cambridge University Press.

Design/methodology/approach: The data for the analysis are drawn from a longitudinal cross-sectional study of the 101 best Slovenian employers between 2008 and 2009. Altogether, over 15,000 respondents and more than 170 companies took part in the study, making it the largest of its kind in Slovenia and southeast Europe. The research method applied in the paper is exploratory and consists of simple paired comparisons of univariate and bivariate statistics, as well as factor analysis, regression analysis, and correlation analysis. Findings: The results show that customer expectations regarding trust and long-term performance have a positive impact on HRM practices within a firm, that HRM positively impacts organizational performance, and that innovation unexpectedly impacts it negatively (at least in the short-term). No significant relationships between customer expectations of services, quality, and price, and their impact on HRM and innovation, respectively, were found. However, the research partially confirms that the crisis is affecting organizational performance because companies are deploying more HRM practices and, unexpectedly, fewer innovation activities.

The crunch occurred because regulation was too lax, and we need to develop new and more effective tools of regulatory control. To focus on current account imbalances or mistakes in setting interest rates as a prime cause of the credit crunch is unconvincing, and has the danger of diverting attention away from the need to increase financial regulation. The current recession does require a re-evaluation of the role fiscal policy can play when interest rates hit a zero bound. An expansionary fiscal policy is required because monetary policy-makers are reluctant to promise higher future inflation, and the impact of quantitative easing is likely to be small. Although rising debt may place a limit on how much conventional fiscal policy can do, not all expansionary fiscal measures require additional borrowing. There are two important lessons for the future. First, although monetary policy should remain the primary tool to stabilize the business cycle, the combination of fiscal implementation lags and uncertainty means that some precautionary fiscal action may be appropriate during the early phase of some economic downturns. Second, to play this 'backstop' stabilization role effectively, a policy that results in the government debt-to-GDP ratio declining (albeit gradually and erratically) in normal times seems appropriate. © The Author 2010.

Design/methodology/approach: The paper looks at the various impacts broadband investment is expected to have: short-term job creation and aggregate demand effects, and long-term productive activities in other sectors of the economy. Moreover, broadband investment is more fiscally sound than other public spending stimulus options, in the sense of coming closer to, or in some cases actually being, self-financing. Findings: Several factors highlight the potential of broadband infrastructure as an important area of public investment during economic downturn, an option also open to policymakers in developing countries. Spending initiatives on next-generation telecommunications networks at a time when labor market conditions are particularly weak can help preserve jobs and head off a potential burden on social safety nets. Bringing forward longer-term aggregate spillover effects of broadband can improve the productivity of the entire economy and is consistent with enhancing longer-run growth and development. Public support also ""crowds in"" private investment when access to private financing is decreasing and more expensive. Originality/value: This is one of the few studies with a focus on the emerging broadband network, its impact on economy and the role of the public sector in rolling out next-generation networks, during economic downturn and in general.

However, some still managed to outperform the market and even made large profits in the midst of widespread economic difficulties. McDonald's was one such company and, in light of its example, many industry magazines and newspapers featured articles suggesting that a quick-service restaurant, with a lower income elasticity of demand, might be better able to survive during constrained economic conditions than upperlevel restaurants. This paper empirically examines whether US restaurants' income elasticity of demand and actual financial performances during economic downturns are affected by the restaurant type. The findings suggest that restaurant type showed no significant effects on the income elasticity of demand for US restaurant companies, while fast-food restaurants showed significantly greater accounting performances than those of non-fast-food restaurants during recession. The insignificant differences in the income elasticity of demand and significant differences in accounting performances during the recession may suggest that fast-food restaurants implemented cost control more effectively than non-fast-food restaurants, and the authors' additional analysis confirms this.","Economic downturn; Firm performance; Income elasticity of demand; Internationalization; Restaurant types; Restaurants","United States; business; demand elasticity; economic conditions; financial crisis; globalization; income; service sector","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84883363109"

Based on historical construction data from highway resurfacing projects in Kentucky, this paper investigates the relationship between oil price, Kentucky diesel price index (KDPI), Kentucky asphalt price index (KAPI), and construction cost of highway resurfacing projects. It was found that the bidding price of a commonly used asphalt mixture was significantly affected by four factors: KDPI, KAPI, number of bidders, and a recession factor primarily attributable to the ""sticky prices"" effect. The KDPI and KAPI can be estimated from the oil price by regression models. The sensitivity of the asphalt mixture and resurfacing project costs to oil price variation was analyzed. On the basis of the analysis result, it is suggested that the highway agencies may avoid the oil price peak typically preceding a recession and take advantage of the oil price plunge after the recession starts. However, in the long run, the agencies and the highway construction industry need to find a solution that is less dependent on oil products. © 2012 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Asphalt pavements; Construction costs; Economic factors; Pricing","Asphalt mixtures; Asphalt pavements; Commerce; Construction industry; Highway engineering; Regression analysis; Sensitivity analysis; Bidding prices; Construction costs; Diesel prices; Economic downturn; Economic factors; Highway agencies; Historical construction; Kentucky; Oil price shocks; Oil Prices; Oil product; Price index; Project cost; Regression model; Costs","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84873339027"

Most of these plans are focused on robotic exploration, but some also include human endeavors extending beyond the International Space Station and low Earth orbit. Looking ahead, the space exploration arena is clearly changing. In the not-too-distant future, space activities are likely to include a significant increase in numbers of nations, partnerships, and commercial and private ventures planning missions that go beyond traditional exploration. Already, space entrepreneurs have announced ambitious plans such as roving and mining on the Moon; harvesting resources on NEAs; and preparing for human travel and establishing outposts on the Moon and Mars. This raises questions of how to ensure that exploration and use are conducted in responsible and balanced ways. There is a growing need to establish more comprehensive regulations governing these activities. In this article, we discuss and compare the main international treaties that govern Antarctica, the oceans, and celestial bodies, as well as the physical, institutional, and ethical concerns raised by various stakeholders. We analyze terrestrial environmental management strategies of the Antarctic Treaty System and the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and highlight their implications for considering ways to deal with increased exploration and commercial ventures that target the use of celestial bodies. The pathway toward the adoption of an international environmental regime for space exploration will be undoubtedly a stepwise approach as the current ambitions and plans of governments, commercial ventures, and the private sector materialize and diversify. © 2013 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84919395340"

During the fifty years that followed, few scholars doubted that the presence of central Mexican-style artifacts and architecture in the Maya region represented an actual migration and colonization of southeastern Mesoamerica by population segments from the great city of Teotihuacan.1 These ""resident Teotihuacanos"" formed enclaves in previously existing Maya sites-frequently depicted until the 1970s as empty ceremonial centers-and, in the most extreme models, were responsible for stimulating nearly all aspects of the Late Classic Maya florescence. Specifically, economic determinists argued that state-level political organization emerged in southern Mesoamerica as a direct result of Teotihuacan influence. To a great degree, this conclusion was based on the comparison of the monumentality of Teotihuacan with the less impressive architecture of Kaminaljuyu. Although therewere a few dissenting voices, theTeotihuacan-centric view maintained currency well into the 1980s. In part this was due to the strength of the voices supporting the preeminence of Teotihuacan-voices that not only dominated theNorth American academy, but also counted in their number some of the loudest, brashest, and truly extraordinary individuals in the colorful history of Mesoamerican archaeology. In the intervening years, many of these voices have fallen silent, have mellowed to a muted basso profundo, or have simply ceased to be relevant. A second reason that Teotihuacan-dominancemodels retained precedence until recent years is that the 1960s saw unparalleled developments in our understanding of Teotihuacan and important Classic Maya sites where central Mexican-style art, artifacts, and architecture are found. Three large- scale projects, which focused on regional survey, mapping, and extensive excavation, were conducted at and around the great city itself.TheTeotihuacan Valley Project (1960-1964) and its successor, the Basin ofMexico Settlement Survey Project (1966-1975), gave dramatic new insight into 13000 years of ecological adaptation and human settlement in central Mexico (e.g., Blanton 1972; Parsons 1971, 1974; Sanders 1965, 1970, 1981; Sanders and Price 1968; Sanders et al. 1979; Wolf 1976). Results of these projects were so im-pressive that aspects of their methodology have served as models for most subsequent surveys in Mesoamerica. Concurrent with William T. Sanders' survey and test pitting in the Teotihuacan Valley, Ignacio Bernal of Mexico's Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia excavated and restored most of the major structures along a 2 km stretch of the Street of the Dead, the north-south ""avenue"" that forms a principal axis of Teotihuacan (e.g., Acosta 1964; Bernal 1963 ; Sociedad Mexicana de Antropología 1966). At an intermediate scale, the Teotihuacan Mapping Project of René Millon, Bruce Drewitt, and George L. Cowgill created a detailed map of the 20 km2 city, complementing survey with systematic surface sampling and small-scale excavations (e.g., Cowgill 1974; Drewitt 1966; Millon1964, 1966, 1967, 1970, 1973, 1981). These three projects, as well as Laurette Séjourné's (1959, 1966a, 1966b) excavations in several apartment compounds during the years 1955-1964, transformed Teotihuacan from a poorly understood site to one of the best-studied cities in Mesoamerica. At the same time, great strides were made in southernMesoamerica. The Tikal Project (1956-1970), directed first by Edwin M. Shook and in later years by William R. Coe, conducted excavations, survey, and restoration on a scale never before seen in Central America. Many important discoveries, particularly of foreign-style ceramics in Burials 10 and 48 and in several so-called problematical deposits (see Chapter 6), and of central Mexican motifs on Stelae 31 and 32 (Chapter 8), pointed directly to a connection with Teotihuacan. Also of great importance was the ambitious Pennsylvania State University Kaminaljuyu Project (1968-1971), directed by William T. Sanders and Joseph W. Michels. Little or no evidence of interaction with Teotihuacan was found in most portions of the site, but additional taludtablero structures and a few tripod cylinders were found during excavations in the Palangana (see Chapter 3; Cheek 1977a). Theoretical contributions by project members, although not representing a unified voice, provided the first anthropological perspectives on Teotihuacan influence at Kaminaljuyu (see Chapter 4; Sanders and Michels 1977). Additional projects conducted in the 1960s and 1970s at sites in theMaya area, including Altun Ha (Chapter 9), Becan (Ball 1974), and Dzibilchaltun (Andrews 1979, 1981:325-326), continued to find evidence-chiefly in the form of talud-tablero architecture, imported or copied centralMexican ceramics, Teotihuacan-inspired iconography, and green obsidian fromthe Pachuca, Hidalgo, source-of interaction with non-Maya societies in highland and Gulf CoastMexico. Other projects adopted what David M. Pendergast (Chapter 9) calls ""Teotihuacanomania,"" and reported a centralMexican presence at sites as widely separated as Chichén Itzá and Bilbao (Parsons 1967-1969). Still others designed ambitious projects to find Teotihuacan influence where comparatively little exists (e.g., Hellmuth 1972, 1986). Given that in 1970 Teotihuacan was by far the bestunderstood Classic-period site in the Mexican highlands, and that evidence for some sort of interaction with central Mexico was either found or perceived at many Maya sites, it is not at all surprising that Teotihuacan was widely viewed as the pristine state ofMesoamerica: a kind of ""mother state"" that inspired-or even mandated-the evolution of all other state-level political systems from Jalisco to Honduras. As a result of this research, the 1960s and early 1970s saw the definition of a ""Middle American Co-Tradition"" (Parsons 1964), a ""Middle Classic"" period of A.D. 400 to 700 (Parsons1967-1969; Pasztory 1978b), and a ""Middle Horizon"" of A.D. 200 to 750 (Wolf 1976). The last, proposed in an attempt to replace the traditional Preclassic/Classic/Postclassic chronological scheme of Mesoamerica with a horizon/intermediate periodization borrowed from Andean studies, was put forward by a small group that included no scholars from Latin America and only one Mayanist (Pasztory 1993;116). Fortunately, the horizon/intermediate scheme now has few adherents and has been scrapped as too cumbersome and inaccurate. Although the concept of a ""Teotihuacan horizon style"" may have some crude utility, it has been abandoned because it blurs regional distinctions, implies a long-outmoded culture-area concept of evolution, and generally is ""out of step"" with processual archaeology (Demarest and Foias 1993 Pasztory 1993 Rice 1993)Moreover, the term ""Middle Horizon"" is neither developmentally neutral nor purely chronological, as its proponents suggested. Finally, improved regional chronologies demonstrate that interaction with Teotihuacan dates to different times at different sites, in some cases was intermittent, and in others was so long in duration as to contradict the very definition of the horizon concept. In addition to referring to a period of posited Teotihuacan hegemony throughout Mesoamerica, the term ""Middle Classic"" has also been used to discuss very different processes limited to the central Maya lowlands. During the sixth century, Tikal and other sites in its sphere of political influence ceased to produce carved monuments bearing Maya dates. The period from A.D. 534 to 593, therefore, has been called the Middle Classic Hiatus, and at Tikal itself the interruption seems to have lingered to the end of the seventh century. An interesting twist was put on Teotihuacan-influence models by Gordon R. Willey (1974)who proposed that this hiatus-once thought to be characteristic of all lowland Maya sites-was caused by the withdrawal of Teotihuacan trade relations. In other words, he suggested that the Middle Classic Hiatus was the antithesis of a period of Teotihuacan domination. In Willey's view, the Middle Classic was the beginning of an intermediate period, not a horizon. Nonetheless, recent breakthroughs in the study of hieroglyphic inscriptions strongly indicate that events leading to the downturn in the political fortunes of Tikal during the Middle Classic Hiatus were linked to other Maya sites rather than to Teotihuacan. Since ""Middle Classic"" has been used in three distinct ways-one that denotes a period of Teotihuacan influence, one that indicates a period after such interaction, and one that may have nothing at all to do with Teotihuacan- it seems best to avoid this confusing term. For this reason, we have opted in this volume to refer to the late fourth through sixth centuries as the late Early Classic. © by the University of Texas Press.

Although the change was not as dramatic as the collapse of party systems in Bolivia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela, the members of the party system have changed profoundly, with new important entrants and the decline of the two traditional parties. The system has also exhibited high electoral volatility. Levels of partisan attachment are low, and party organizations have weakened. In this chapter, we describe this process of deinstitutionalization and examine its causes. Many countries in Latin America have experienced collapses of major parties, party system deinstitutionalization, and even party system collapse since the early 1990s. In this sense, Colombia is not unusual. The Colombian case is distinctive in that both of the traditional parties suffered major electoral and organizational erosion but still remain important actors. The closest counterpart among the cases examined in this volume is Argentina, whose party system has also experienced deinstitutionalization, growing fragmentation, and decreasing nationalization, but in which one of the traditional parties, the Peronists, was dominant from 2003 to 2015. Unlike most of the other cases in which once institutionalized systems either collapsed or seriously frayed, Colombia did not experience traumatic bursts of hyperinflation or severe economic downturns (Lupu 2016 and Chapter 12 in this volume; Roberts 2014). The decomposition of Colombia’s traditional party system occurred in relative economic tranquility compared to the massive upheaval so many other Latin American countries experienced. The economic distresses that were pivotal in undermining traditional parties in Argentina, Peru, and Venezuela are not central to the Colombian story of party system deinstitutionalization. In the Colombian case, the mismanagement of the security situation by both traditional parties and a severe security threat in the early 2000s fostered deep change in the competition for the presidency and altered national party competition. In the midst of an increasing disconnect between regional and national party politics, these changes did not have the same effect sub-nationally. Local patronage and clientelistic structures allowed the two traditional parties, particularly the Liberal Party, to survive. Although some regional politicians switched to new parties, the pace of change in regional politics was slower. The Liberal and Conservative parties remained relevant actors in municipal and regional elections. © Scott Mainwaring 2018.","","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85048425123"

Beginning in the 1980s, the number of tourists who visited the continent annually began to rise sharply, and within the space of twenty years the numbers had increased by more than six hundred percent. Despite a global recession and downturn in visitor numbers over the last two austral seasons, the expectation is that Antarctic tourist numbers will trend upward again as the world tourism market recovers and the demand for Antarctic visits increases. In a continent renowned both as the last great global wilderness and as a place dedicated to scientific research in the interests of humankind, tourism on this scale presents a formidable range of issues for the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties (ATCPs) to contend with. This article suggests that the rapid growth in Antarctic tourism, and the impacts of that tourism coupled with the lack of a comprehensive regulatory and management framework for tourism now pose a considerable challenge to both the Consultative Parties and to the Antarctic Treaty System (ATS) itself. The obligations and duties of the ATCPs under the Antarctic Treaty and other ATS instruments require a robust, strategic response by them to the issues and concerns generated by the growth of tourism. What is needed, it is argued, is for the parties to initiate a more interventionist pro-active policy approach to create a holistic, binding tourism framework so that they may fulfill more effectively their stewardship and governance roles in Antarctica, prevent degradation of Antarctica's environment, and reduce risks to tourists themselves. © 2013 Cambridge University Press.","","Antarctica; economic growth; policy approach; regulatory framework; tourism economics; tourism management; tourism market","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84879315183"

Certainly, the U.S. military owes its continued preeminence to both the quality of its combatants and the superiority of its weaponry.

Consequently, the services are constrained by aging equipment and outdated technology, even as other countries are strengthening their defense capabilities.

Then, for the capitalist mode of production, I derive a theory of over investment relative to consumer demand that applies when economic expansion does not pull real wages up as fast as productivity grows. Third, I develop the theory of the underconsumption trap as one result of an economic downturn. I argue that theory of over-investment relative to consumer demand is a plausible story of the 1920s and the origins of the Great Depression of the 1930s, while the underconsumption trap was an important reason why the Depression was so deep and long. Finally, I comment on the possible applicability of the theories to the post-World War II era. © 1983, UNION FOR RADICAL POLITICAL ECONOMICS.

In this context, researchers are concerned about the effects of inequality on the economy, and this concern is even more marked now, when the world is facing a new crisis that seems the equal of, or even more devastating than the last Great Recession as a consequence of Covid-19. Nevertheless, there is a lack of studies which consider the effects of inequality on entrepreneurship. This paper aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of the relationship between inequality and entrepreneurship in the context of an economic downturn. We focus on the 17 autonomous communities in Spain during the Great Recession (2007-2013). Using unbalanced panel data, we study the effect on entrepreneurial activity, differentiating between total, necessity-and opportunity-driven entrepreneurship. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, our results offer new empirical evidence concerning the relationship between growing inequality and entrepreneurial activity, showing significant differences from results in the existing literature. Second, we explain how, in a recessionary context of highly restricted financial resources, inequality can negatively affect total, necessity-and opportunity-based entrepreneurship, preventing a large part of the population from engaging in this activity. © 2020 by the authors.

The closure resulted in 700 involuntary redundancies with a further 400 positions lost at MMAL's Tonsley Park plant through voluntary redundancies. The loss of jobs and associated economic activity were a major shock to southern Adelaide, a relatively poor region with few large manufacturing establishments, a limited economic infrastructure and a relatively unskilled labour force. The region had suffered setbacks in the previous three years with a downturn in the wine industry and the closure of the nearby Mobil Oil Refinery at Port Stanvac. This paper draws on debates around multiscalar governance in order to understand how governments have responded to employment loss in southern Adelaide. The paper pays particular attention to the balance between regional and industry-focused initiatives and suggests that regions need to ensure they occupy a central position within the strategies and actions of governments. The paper also highlights the vulnerability of regions that lack growth coalitions able to operate as effective advocates for their region.","","Adelaide; Australasia; Australia; South Australia; automobile industry; closure; economic activity; economic conditions; economic policy; economic structure; government relations; political economy; unemployment","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-37549036273"

Using an unbalanced panel of 154 countries from 1980 to 2006, the paper shows that banking crises are associated with a significant and long-lasting increase in government debt. The effect is a function of the severity of the crisis. In particular, for severe crises, comparable to the most recent one in terms of output losses, banking crises are followed by a medium-term increase of about 37 percentage points in the government gross debt-to-GDP ratio. In addition, the debt ratio increased more in countries with a higher initial gross debt-to-GDP ratio, with a higher share of foreign debt, and with a lower quality of institutions. The increase in government debt is also a function of the size of the fiscal stimuli implemented to counter the economic downturns and varies with the type of banking intervention policy used. © 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84874361822"

These workers often possess few marketable skills and few resources with which to support themselves during periods of economic transition. In Working and Poor, a distinguished group of economists and policy experts, headlined by editors Rebecca Blank, Sheldon Danziger, and Robert Schoeni, examine how economic and policy changes over the last twenty-five years have affected the well-being of low-wage workers and their families. Working and Poor examines every facet of the economic well-being of less-skilled workers, from employment and earnings opportunities to consumption behavior and social assistance policies. Rebecca Blank and Heidi Schierholz document the different trends in work and wages among less-skilled women and men. Between 1979 and 2003, labor force participation rose rapidly for these women, along with more modest increases in wages, while among the men both employment and wages fell. David Card and John DiNardo review the evidence on how technological changes have affected less-skilled workers and conclude that the effect has been smaller than many observers claim. Philip Levine examines the effectiveness of the Unemployment Insurance program during recessions. He finds that the program's eligibility rules, which deny benefits to workers who have not met minimum earnings requirements, exclude the very people who require help most and should be adjusted to provide for those with the highest need. On the other hand, Therese J. McGuire and David F. Merriman show that government help remains a valuable source of support during economic downturns. They find that during the most recent recession in 2001, when state budgets were stretched thin, legislatures resisted political pressure to cut spending for the poor. Working and Poor provides a valuable analysis of the role that public policy changes can play in improving the plight of the working poor. A comprehensive analysis of trends over the last twenty-five years, this book provides an invaluable reference for the public discussion of work and poverty in America.

The results show that constrained firms tended to increase capital investments during these severe economic downturns if they had pre-saved more cash. Constrained firms instead exhibited lower excess returns and incurred higher likelihoods of financial distress during the severe downturns if they had saved less cash prior to the events. Firms that experienced the 2000 dot-com crash and saved cash thereafter were less likely to default during the 2008 financial crisis, indicating the existence and benefit of learning effects. This study supports a precautionary motive for cash savings, showing that pre-saved cash helps financially constrained firms fund investment and reduces the likelihood of financial distress during severe market downturns. It demonstrates that saving for a rainy day really is valuable. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Cash holdings; Financial crisis; Financial distress; Value of cash","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85038832653"

In response, leading economists have invoked the 'laws of economics' to warn that the extensions may be responsible for much of the current unemployment crisis. This prediction follows directly from a neoclassical vision in which jobs are taken only to generate the income necessary for desired levels of consumption and leisure, workers can 'price' themselves into a job by lowering wage demands, and benefit eligibility rules are not effectively enforced, so any income replacement must reduce work incentives and increase unemployment. In contrast, in a Keynesian-Institutionalist vision, there is job rationing in economic downturns, worker identities are often closely linked to work, there is recognition of long-run scarring effects of extended unemployment, and UB work rules are enforced, so even generous income replacement is not likely to produce much voluntary unemployment, especially in recessions. This paper reviews the evidence on the effects of the UB extensions of 2008-9. The case for the orthodox prediction has relied heavily on extrapolating from pre-Great Recession findings, particularly through the use of selected 'spike at benefit-exhaustion' results from the early 1980s. We conclude that the more recent spike evidence, the recent shifts in the Beveridge curve, and the labour flows data (unemployment to employment) evidence offer little support for the orthodox disincentive view of the current unemployment crisis in the US. If UB generosity has increased unemployment, it has done so more by keeping workers attached to the labour market than by reducing the incentive to work. © The Authors 2011.

To address this question, this paper assesses the potential impacts of faster economic growth in developed and emerging economies on the one hand and a replication of the recent economic downturn on the other hand. The empirical analysis uses AGLINK-COSIMO, a recursive-dynamic, partial equilibrium, supply-demand model. Simulation results demonstrate that higher economic growth influences demand more than supply, resulting in higher world market prices for agricultural commodities. Emerging economies tend to import more and to stock less in order to cover their demand needs, while the rest of the world increases its exports. The modelled faster economic growth also helps developing countries to improve their trade balance, but does not necessarily give them the incentive to address domestic food security concerns by boosting domestic consumption. A replication of an economic downturn leads to lower world prices, and while the magnitude of the effects decreases over time, markets do not regain their baseline levels within a 5-year period. Due to the lower world market prices, developing countries import more and increase their per capita food calorie intake. However, as developing countries become more import dependent, this also implies that they become more vulnerable to disruptions in agricultural world markets. © 2014 The Author(s).","Agricultural commodity markets; Economic growth; Food security","commodity market; economic growth; empirical analysis; food security; incentive; simulation","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84906310379"

While the decline in outflows from developed countries has been similar in magnitude to that in previous recessions, the recovery in FDI has been much slower than in the past. Inflows to emerging markets, which remained stable during previous economic crises, have experienced an overall decline. Both patterns indicate that the global scale of the current crisis has had a different and more marked FDI response than after earlier individual country crises. Compared with other global economic downturns since the 1970s, the current FDI recession has also been greater in magnitude. (The exception to this was the large FDI plunge in the early 2000s, despite the much smaller economic crisis at the time.) To the extent past FDI patterns can provide relevant insights to the current FDI slump, this could indicate that global FDI flows may remain below 2007 levels until at least 2014. The paper concludes by recommending policymakers to not just further liberalize FDI regimes - the typical response to earlier crises - but rather to use the downturn to completely rethink their FDI policies, with an enhanced focus on promotion of ""sustainable FDI"".","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84858192642"

Results shows the connectedness between green bonds and the conventional asset classes intensified during the outbreak of the Coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) as investors shifted their investment towards fixed income assets due to the plunge in the prices of stocks and commodities. The results also shows that green bonds are strongly connected with treasury bonds, aggregate bonds and bond index, as they share similarities with respect to issuance, risk and governance. Connectedness is weak in the case of composite index and energy bond index, as their prices do not have substantial influence on the green bond market.

Design/methodology/approach: To evaluate the presence of a relationship between employee need and reward allocation in a pay-for-performance system, a questionnaire was administered to a sample of 292 employees from two departments at an academic medical center. Findings: The findings highlight the positive relationship between employee need and reward allocation that remains when controlling for employee performance evaluation ratings. Findings further show that employee communication with the manager about need explains this relationship. Research limitations/implications: The findings make two important contributions to research on reward allocation and performance management. First, the results show employee need is related to the allocation of rewards in organizational settings outside of collectivistic cultures or developing countries. Second, by demonstrating the role of employee communication with managers about need within the relationship between employee need and reward allocation, the paper provides a more detailed understanding of additional factors related to compensation decisions in a pay-for-performance system. Originality/value: Little research has explored the relationship between employee need and reward decisions at an individual level in organizational settings within individualistic cultures. The findings from this study address this gap by establishing the presence of this relationship in a pay-for-performance reward-based organization with service-based values. This finding is timely due to the current economic downturn experienced by organizations, and thereby the level of employee need observed in Western individualistic cultures. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","employee need; Performance management; Performance rewards; Quantitative; Reward allocation","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84896264328"

Within this increasingly volatile global landscape, more than ever there is a need for the tourism industry to embrace a disciplined, structured and continuous approach to identifying and monitoring future trends and issues to inform policymaking and strategic planning. Yet in Australia it has been claimed that a preoccupation with marketing and short-term tactical planning, at the expense of long-term, strategic thinking, has led to limited planning perspectives for tourism.

Since the nineteenth century, British Conservatism had represented a comfortable synthesis of a soft Burkean traditionalism and class-based paternalism with an effort to expand the party's appeal to the working class. Thatcher's aggressive neoliberal challenge to this tradition never truly displaced the older paternalistic sense of noblesse oblige or the preference for societal consensus and incremental change. Instead, the two elements came into an uneasy coexistence that has informed Tory ambivalence about the EU. This article argues that Cameron's gradual distancing of Britain from the EU has paralleled his championing of economic austerity at home. It argues further that Cameron's policy-making response to the post-2007 economic downturn and European debt crisis can best be understood as a reflection of unresolved tensions within British Conservative thought. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84918506931"

Two exogenous variables, equity returns and gross domestic product growth, outperform other variables as regime indicators and appear to capture risks of downturns in real estate. We extend the model to the smoothing equation, allowing for switching behavior by appraisers, using two new techniques: the TAR-AR and TAR-TAR approaches. The ""co-switching"" specification opens up a new frontier of empirical research.

In addition, 24 policy briefs, country papers, and publications from the UN, WHO, FAO, and OECD were cited. The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review of existing literature on the adverse effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on agricultural food systems, as well as potential strategies for building robust, resilient, and sustainable food systems to ensure global food security, safety, and endeavors regarding future global emergencies, as well as new research policies while achieving SDG targets. This would fill a research gap while also having long-term implications for health, agricultural, and food resilience policy development in a rapidly changing world. Covid-19 demonstrates how human, animal, and environmental health are all interconnected, emphasizing the need for one health legislation and a paradigm shift in planetary health. Furthermore, it identifies potential mechanisms for rebuilding better systems by shifting priorities toward policy coherence, innovative food system governance, re-engineering market access, and nexus thinking in the food system approach.

This transformation has been facilitated through the use of a series of images and metaphors that appear and reappear in textual descriptions. In this article, I re-create the play and counter-play that lies behind these metaphors, and in doing so group them into three overall tropes: Tokyo as city of villages; Tokyo as city of transience; and Tokyo as textual city. I argue that each of these tropes can be read as a ‘positive’ equivalent of a previously (and sometimes contemporaneously) existing negative counterpart and that in each of them lies a reference point to the Other of Western cities.

An exploratory approach analyses the socio-economic resilience between different member states, and VoC ideal-types (liberal market economies, the continental capitalism, the social-democrat economies, the Mediterranean capitalism, and the Eastern economies). The study presents a typology of resilience clusters in European regions. There were found six types of profiles concerning resilience: great performers, fast growth, intermediate position, R&D reduction, regions in divergence, and Mediterranean regions in big trouble. The study identifies key aspects for resilience, providing policy implications for regional economic policies. The comparison of the resilience clusters and the original VoC categorization has implications for this branch of literature as it does not completely address the variety of regional answers to the shocks. © 2019 The Author(s).

These concerns are amplified in the context of the recent global economic downturn. Within the context of numerous unfinished developments, vacancy has become an at once more visible and politicised feature of post-crisis cities. In this paper, we draw on a qualitative study of urban gardeners in Dublin to offer an analysis of the growth in, and motivations behind, UA and its relationship to vacant space following the crisis. Our core argument is two-fold. Firstly, practices of UA, while deployed as a stop-gap between development booms, have potential to challenge the normalcy of neoliberal urban development models. Secondly, while the motivations behind those participating in UA are reflective of the immediate material conditions of crisis (e.g. unemployment), they are also indicative of more deep-seated desires to re-calibrate values and lifestyles in the post-crash period. Taken together, we conclude that UA has a role to play in contributing to a wider, more broad-based political platform seeking the re-animation of vacant space in the city.","Austerity; Commoning; Post-crisis; Urban agriculture; Vacancy","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85026526477"

The most common explanation for such a significance is that excellent retention management has become a major source of competitive advantage in the modern and rapidly globalising business world. Another key reason that is mentioned by a majority of companies is that it just simply costs too much money to replace even one valuable employee. Hence, the main task of retention management is twofold. Besides applying the correct motivation techniques to retain its top talent and maintain a competitive advantage, the organisation also has to reduce the replacement cost and especially its 'soft' component (the cost of losing employees' experience, professional expertise, key customer relationships, etc.) if or when an employee does decide to leave. Most of the academic literature on retention deals with general and unspecific preventive strategies pertaining mainly to industrial companies. This paper concentrates particularly on the retention techniques designed to protect the important tacit knowledge in Professional Services Firms (PSFs), which would help them reduce their overall replacement costs and increase their competitiveness in the marketplace. © 2008 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","Knowledge management; Management consulting firms; Tacit knowledge; Talent retention management","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-51849102073"

It demonstrates that influential economists, such as F.A. Hayek and Milton Friedman, authors at key British think tanks such as the Institute of Economic Affairs and the Centre for Policy Studies, and important political figures of the Thatcher and New Labour governments shared a similar conception of the consumer. For neoliberals, the idea that consumers were weak in the face of businesses and large corporations was almost offensive. Instead, consumers were imagined to be sovereign agents in the economy, whose consumption decisions played a central role in the construction of their human capital and in the enabling of their aspirations. Consumption, just like production, came to be viewed as an enterprising and entrepreneurial activity. Consequently, from the early 1980s until the present day, it was felt necessary that banks should have the freedom to meet the borrowing needs of consumers. Credit rationing would be a thing of the past. Just like businesses, consumers and households could use debt to expand their stock of personal assets. By utilizing the method of French philosopher Michel Foucault this book provides an original analysis of the policy ideas and political speeches of key figures in the New Right, in government and at the Bank of England. And it addresses the key question as to why policy-makers both in Britain and the United States did little or nothing to stem rising consumer and household indebtedness, instead always choosing to see increasing house prices and homeownership as a positive to be encouraged. © 2012 Christopher Payne.","","","Book","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84911045992"

Both downturns featured global banking crises which were generated by boom-slump macroeconomic cycles. During both crises, world trade collapsed faster than world incomes and the trade decline was highly synchronized across countries. During the Depression income losses and rises in trade barriers explain trade's collapse. Owing to vertical specialization and more intense trade in durables, today's trade collapse is due to uncertainty and small shocks to trade costs hitting international supply chains. So far, the global economy has avoided the global trade wars and banking collapses of the Depression, perhaps owing to improved policy.

Yet, most national and international policymakers appear persistently blind to this fact, as has been highlighted by the recent global economic crisis. They need to recognise and value care work if they are to support vulnerable families from the effects of economic downturn. The 2008-2009 global economic crisis has served to underscore the potential effects of inadequate attention to care economy dynamics, with serious risks to children's education, development, health and protection already evident. Nevertheless, economic recovery measures continue to provide little space or funding for protective or remedial measures. We argue that gender and care-sensitive social protection measures are a good means by which to support the position of carers and to create better visibility within policy circles, while also demonstrating considerable returns for human well-being and broader long-term economic development. These returns are evident in pre-existing social protection programmes, from which it will be vital to learn lessons. Including care-sensitive social protection in economic recovery packages also has the potential to improve the visibility and importance of care in a transformative and sustainable way. © Oxfam GB 2010.","Childcare; Economic crises; Gender; Poverty; Recovery; Social protection","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-77954247712"

Research reveals, however, that not only does downsizing generally fail to improve a firm’s financial performance, but that it may even lead to reduced financial performance. To investigate this puzzling outcome, we build on previous research and integrate the concepts of downsizing, social capital, dynamic capabilities and performance in a multi-level model as well as discuss how social capital mediates the relationship between downsizing and dynamic capabilities. Thereafter, we develop (a) four propositions to elucidate how changes to the structural dimension of social capital due to downsizing, i.e. the removal of three key social network positions and changes to the firm’s network structure, negatively mediate the relationship between downsizing and a firm’s dynamic capabilities, and (b) two propositions incorporating internal (knowledge intensity) and external (institutional pressures) contextual variables in our model. We conclude by discussing how our research contributes to the downsizing and SHRM literature as well as the resource-based view and social capital literature before providing suggestions for future research and practitioners. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Downsizing; dynamic capabilities; performance; social capital; social networks","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84958044299"

Due to strict lockdown measures, many countries experienced economic downturns, negatively affecting many industries including energy, manufacturing, agricul-ture, finance, healthcare, food, education, tourism, and sports. Despite this, the COVID-19 pandemic provided a rare opportunity to observe the impacts of worldwide lockdown on global carbon dioxide (CO2 ) emissions and climate change. Being the main greenhouse gas responsible for rising global surface temperature, CO2 is released to the atmosphere primarily by burning fossil fuels. Compared to 2019, CO2 emissions for the world and Malaysia decreased significantly by 4.02% (−1365.83 MtCO2 ) and 9.7% (−225.97 MtCO2 ) in 2020. However, this is insufficient to cause long-term impacts on global CO2 levels and climate change. Therefore, in this review, we explored the effects of worldwide lockdown on global CO2 levels, the impacts of national lockdown on Malaysia’s CO2 emissions, and the influence of climate change in Malaysia. © 2021 by the authors.

Using German administrative data for the years 1985 to 2010 and an estimation framework based on duration models, the authors construct a time series of the labor supply elasticity to the firm and estimate its relationship to the unemployment rate. They find that firms possess more monopsony power during economic downturns. Half of this cyclicality stems from workers’ job separations being less wage driven when unemployment rises, and the other half mirrors that firms find it relatively easier to poach workers. Results show that the cyclicality is more pronounced in tight labor markets with low unemployment, and that the findings are robust to controlling for time-invariant unobserved worker or plant heterogeneity. The authors further document that cyclical changes in workers’ entry wages are of similar magnitude as those predicted under pure monopsonistic wage setting. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","business cycle; monopsony power; wage cyclicality","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85045526097"

Design/methodology/approach: The participants in this multiple case study research comprised randomly selected managers from SMEs operating in Dubai, United Arab Emirates with specialist expertise in successfully implementing innovation in their organizations. Individual interviews were undertaken with participants to gain both an insight and understanding regarding which innovation strategies are best suited to improve performance goal outcomes. A further analysis of workplace internal documents, policies, procedures, SMEs’ websites, review websites and press releases afforded additional insights related to the application of innovative workplace practices which supported productivity improvements in relation to performance goal outcomes. Findings: The findings of this study identified that the role of the top management in cultivating an innovative culture, the identification of ideas as the starting point for innovation and the recognition of customers as resources for the company. Practical implications: Implementing the findings from this study may support job creation, economy protection in downturns and contribution to economic growth, since thriving SMEs have a positive impact on community development through the generation of the employment. Furthermore, the results of this study can help in creating an increase in improving the productivity of Dubai SMEs in Dubai’s GDP, improvement in investment opportunities; better working conditions for employees and possibilities for expanding the operations of Dubai SMEs globally. Originality/value: This study is of value because its findings may contribute to local and global economic growth. Exploring successful innovation implementation strategies in SMEs can result in useful guidelines that SME managers can use to reach the performance goals of their SMEs. Since governmental policies are critical to improving business performance, the Government of Dubai may benefit from this study by addressing key success factors for SMEs through policies and regulations. This study has particular value given the lack of studies that address the issue of innovation implementation in SMEs, especially for SMEs in emerging economies. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Innovation; Resource-based view; Small–medium enterprises; Strategy","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85074879610"

Rather than seeking absolute gender differences in risk aversion, we take a more nuanced approach, considering executive job demands and decision orientation theories to examine underlying psychological mechanisms and economic boundary conditions to gender differences in strategic risk-taking. We test our hypotheses using multiple methods and samples, including an archival study of Fortune 1,000 firms and a survey of CEOs. Our results challenge absolute assumptions of gender risk preferences; rather, we find that female CEOs are less likely to choose risky strategies in a high job demands environment (e.g., economic downturn) due to underlying gender differences in other-orientation. © The Authors 2021.","CEO decision-making; executive job demands; gender; other-orientation; strategic risk-taking","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85103637437"

We find that firm-level employment increases while the likelihood of downsizing decreases with BOD female representation. In corroboration, the level of under-staffing, and hence its associated problems, reduces with BOD female representation. The impact of female directors on employment is stronger in the absence of tokenism, more evident during downturns and shaped by female director typology.

Faced with this volatile economic environment, we should thus view the intra-corporate allocation of competencies not as a top-down hierarchy with very separate responsibilities and roles, but as a heterarchy with scope for subsidiary upgrading.

One of the most ubiquitous problems found within correctional institutions are the conditions inmates are forced to live in particularly, when penal facilities are overcrowded. These conditions have led to extensive litigation, compelling the judicial system to change. Although overall conditions have improved, a perpetually increasing inmate population continues to plague correctional systems as costs continue to rise. As state budgets have become strained during the economic downturns, many states' officials view less punitive measures as possible solutions to the excessive costs of administering punishment and overcrowded inmate populations. Due to facility overcrowding, several states have actually been placed under federal court order to reduce their inmate population in order to protect inmates' constitutional rights. Although this has resulted in a change of policies to help alleviate prison overcrowding, there is little evidence these are anything more than short-term fixes to a problem with no end in sight. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","corrections policy; inmate population; prison overcrowding; sentencing","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84897027913"

How successful are these strategies in swaying citizens' views? While electoral autocrats frequently resort to these strategies, there is surprisingly little evidence about their effectiveness. To address this gap, I took advantage of the recent economic crisis in Turkey and deployed a population-based survey experiment that mimicked incumbent's use of these strategies. I find that incumbent's efforts of shifting the blame fail to elicit intended effects among large parts of the electorate. In contrast, changing the political agenda away from the economy to an issue area that is more favorable for the incumbent is more effective for shoring up popular support.

This research explores the impacts of LDLC on the experiences and personal development of workers in order to inform policies, programs, and community services to support workers during these experiences.

Entrepreneurial activity is generally co-determined by economic and cultural factors. However, cultural change normally requires a much longer time to take place than economic changes do. This may prompt a so-called cultural hysteresis effect in the efficiency of entrepreneurial incentives. To analyze these effects, data from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (2003-2010) are used. A Two-Stage Least Square instrumental variable and a logit model with difference-in-differences are employed. We find that the cultural hysteresis is less prominent among Mediterranean countries. Moreover, it is almost negligible in the response to incentives by female youth. © 2016 The Author 2016. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Cambridge Political Economy Society.

It then more briefly looks at twentieth-century experience - the 1930s, the 1970s and Asia in 1997-98. The hypotheses tested are that migration is reduced by downturns in destination countries but hardly affected by the cycle in home countries; that such downturns also lead to some return migration; that existing migrants suffer the effects of downturns more severely than natives and that although downturns may affect the timing of migration policy changes, the latter owe more to underlying secular forces than to short-term shocks.

I deconstruct the rhetorical strategies these programs deployed to advance the network's free market interpretation of the economic crisis. Key to Fox's interpretive strategy was a claim to represent 'the Forgotten man' of the downturn. However, in my analysis I show how this claim was established less by advocating policies that directly support working-class material interests and more by presenting Fox News pundits as the protectors and advocates of traditional moral-economic principles. Fox News pundits drew these principles from a long-standing strain of the American populist tradition called 'producerism.' My analysis illustrates how - in framing the wealthy and the business class as 'job creators' - Fox News programs reworked this tradition in order to include corporate managers in the moral community of producers, alongside members of the working class. This strategy was successful, I argue, because this earlier American political discourse still informs, often in unrecognized ways, the underlying normative assumptions that are expressed in modern debates about class, work, and wealth distribution. © The Author(s) 2014.","class identity; Fox News; Great Recession; moral rhetoric; populism; textual analysis","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84899985528"

The field of tourism studies is largely accounting for the influences of complex change on tourism. However, dive tourism research is lagging behind in this regard. A resilience framework for the study of dive tourism systems is proposed that addresses the need to better account for the threats posed by complex change and the ways dive tourism is responding. The effectiveness of the framework is demonstrated through a case study in the US Virgin Islands. In-depth, semi-structured interviews were carried out with dive operators and government officials. Findings show that perturbations to dive tourism include a lack of support from the larger social–political system, the recent US economic downturn, and an invasive fish species. On the other hand, sources of resilience include dive operators’ formation of self-advocating organizations, recognition of an inexperienced and increasingly frugal client base, and their own contributions to environmental protection. Gaps in the existing theoretical and applied knowledge about dive tourism can be filled through research on (1) social and economic perturbations to dive tourism and (2) ways dive operators respond to perturbations to maintain their resilience. © 2013, © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","complex change; dive tourism; operators; qualitative case study; resilience; self-organization; social–ecological systems; US Virgin Islands","Leeward Islands [Lesser Antilles]; Virgin Islands; Virgin Islands (U.S.); quantitative analysis; self organization; tourism; tourism economics; tourism management","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84908156790"

States and intergovernmental bodies insist that this should be pursued via a tremendous spike in private investment in renewable power – encouraged and coordinated by states. However, this renewable investment boom will have to swim against the current of the stagnation of the world economy since the 1970s, characterized by weak rates of investment and growth. Undertaking decarbonization in this context presents unique political economy dilemmas. Firstly, although slow growth helps to reduce carbon emissions by lowering energy use, it simultaneously impedes energy efficiency gains. Secondly, the stagnant state of global industry militates against its adoption of expensive decarbonized industrial processes. Thirdly, while most renewable power sources have failed to attract sufficient investment, those that have expanded rapidly – particularly solar photovoltaic – have tended to exhaust their growth potential due to falling prices and profitability. Finally, economic stagnation has destabilized political institutions, exerting pressures on governments to stimulate growth regardless of the environmental implications. States must navigate these intractable dilemmas as they strategize to decarbonize the downturn. © The Author(s) 2022.","capitalism; Climate change; decarbonization; neoliberalism; stagnation","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85136211780"

In response to the financial crisis which had begun at the end of 2007 and had turned into a full global recession by the middle of 2008, the government introduced two substantial stimulus packages funded from the large budget surplus it had inherited from its predecessor. The fiscal stimulus has helped Australia to become the only advanced economy to avoid a technical recession (to date), although there is concern that the downturn has created a situation where social policy is being driven by political expediency rather than by the principles and commitments set out in the government's pre-election social policy manifesto. Against this background, this article examines how the latest crisis has shaped social security policy in Australia and compares the recent policy response with the policy response to earlier crises. Analysis focuses not just on what was actually done, but also on the constraining role of prevailing economic and political circumstances and on the processes that were used to drive reform in a wage earners' welfare state. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Global financial crisis; Social security; Targeting; Welfare reform","Australia; financial crisis; labor market; labor policy; neoliberalism; social impact; social inclusion; social policy; social security; wage gap; welfare reform","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-79959225112"

Empirical evidence based on quantitative research into the added value of quality design on real estate performance has seen little advancement during the past two decades. Office sector hedonic analysis has been predominantly characterised by a piecemeal approach focusing on specific attributes and lacking a holistic approach to the effects of design quality on real estate value. This paper brings forward new empirical evidence to assess the added value of quality design based on quantitative analysis of office sector performance in the historic urban core of a UK city. Design/methodology/approach: Using a unique dataset of 279 Belfast City Centre office properties rented during the period 1995-2009, this study employs regression analysis to estimate a hedonic pricing model based on a composite range of variables. The contribution of this study is the complementary utilisation of quantitative and qualitative methods to generate variables incorporating a holistic approach to design quality at three different levels of investigation: interior; exterior/architectural; and urban scale. Findings: The key findings show that higher design quality specifications in the three levels (interior, exterior and urban scale) can generate rent premiums. Aspects of quality design that include connectivity and building facade distinctiveness enhance corporate image; and material quality appropriateness adds to real estate value whereas the lack of preference for tall buildings and high-end interior quality specifications in historic cores reflect market reactions to economic trends. Practical implications: This paper provides investors and developers with insights about those aspects of quality design that are highly valued by office tenants in historic urban cores. This is especially significant in the downturn of the property cycle with investment priorities playing a crucial role in a project's economic viability. Originality/value: This study bridges a significant gap in the literature concerning hedonic investigation of the added value of quality design on real estate performance. This holistic approach using quantitative and qualitative methods and incorporating urban design variables constitutes a unique approach to quantifying quality impacts on real estate value. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Belfast; Commercial property; Design for quality; Hedonic modelling; Real estate value; United Kingdom; Urban centres; Urban design quality","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84877836691"

In 2005, the region attained its semiautonomous status, and up until 2014 benefited from its constitutionally mandated share of the central budget and increased foreign investment, which came primarily from neighbouring countries. The 2014 economic downturn of the region started with the halt of transfers from the central budget, deepened with the drop of oil prices and ISIS’s occupation of Mosul, and continued with the September 2017 independence referendum. Due to the Kurdistan Regional Government’s (K.R.G.’s) reliance on Turkey’s oil pipeline for autonomous revenue, as well as on foreign companies to extract its oil and gas reserves, the region’s economic livelihood strongly depends on healthy diplomatic relations with neighbouring countries. These states, however, are directly opposed to the K.R.G.’s movement towards secession. After the independence vote, regional powers, along with Baghdad, adopted an aggressive rhetoric and implemented punitive measures towards the K.R.I., placing the economic interests of the K.R.I. at odds with its nationalistic aspirations. As the ramifications of the referendum continue to unfold, the Kurdish push for independence on a political basis subsequently threatens the K.R.I.’s economic prospects as well as the privileges that its citizens enjoyed with their semiautonomous region during the post-U.S. occupation period.

Existing observational studies fail to isolate the effect of economic conditions and the effect of elite framing of these conditions. We therefore designed a survey experiment to evaluate how economic change in conjunction with different elite frames impact citizens’ support for welfare state retrenchment. We hypothesise and demonstrate that the effects of these frames differ by income group and partisanship. Our survey experiment – carried out in the United Kingdom – demonstrates that poor economic prospects generally motivate support for unemployment benefits vis-à-vis deficit reduction. Emphasis on inequality does not change this picture. Emphasis on government debt and deficits increases support for retrenchment compared with objective information. We find support for the hypothesis that partisans are less responsive to the economy than independents. However, income differences are a surprisingly weak moderator of our treatments. We derive two main conclusions: first, elite frames significantly influence the effect of economic change on welfare state preferences. Second, party identification is crucial to understand individual differences in welfare state preferences and should receive more attention in future research. © The Author(s) 2015.","Economic crisis; elite framing; partisanship; preferences; welfare state","United Kingdom; economic conditions; economic instability; elite politics; experimental study; political economy; unemployment benefit; wage gap; attention; economic aspect; government; human; unemployment; United Kingdom; welfare","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84957807766"

One of such strategic behaviours regards the way of intervention on several innovation areas through different strategies. Disentangling the effect of pre-crisis adopted innovations, industrial relations quality and economic performance on such strategies may be of extreme relevance to analyse the nexus between the reactions to the challenges brought by the crisis and the capacity of the firms to proactively tackle economic downturns. The present work provides an empirical analysis on the basis of more than 500 Italian manufacturing firms located in Emilia-Romagna region. The results suggest the existence of strong relationships between pre-crisis innovative activities and the capacity to react to the challenges brought by the crisis. This happens through innovative strategies, whose contents are mainly product (technological competitiveness), process and organisation/HRM innovative dimensions (cost competitiveness/efficiency gaining). Complementary innovative activities emerge as a key factor. Industrial relations quality is also related to the strategic reaction to the crisis: more participative industrial relations support the adoption of diversified types of innovation strategies. There is, instead, no evidence of a relation between past economic performance and innovation actions in the crisis.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84884488646"

Transit services are facing a number of challenges as a consequence of this severe crisis. However, each attribute characterizing transit services has evolved in a different manner, thereby raising some chances and opportunities at some specific areas. This study investigates the evolution of service quality on a metropolitan transit system under economic crisis conditions. We used data from three customer satisfaction surveys (2008, 2011, and 2014) conducted at the bus transit service of the metropolitan area of Granada (Spain). Principal component analysis (PCA) and structural equation modeling (SEM) approaches were applied. PCA results show that the attributes describing the service were grouped into two levels of dimensions according to their impact on users' overall satisfaction (Transport Service Factors and Comfort and Convenience Factors). Subsequently, following a competing model strategy, the existing relationships between users' satisfaction and perception of service quality dimensions were ascertained. Finally, three SEMs were calibrated, one for each year under study, and were subjected to a multigroup analysis to test for equivalence among the three models. The outcomes show that fare of the ticket has lost importance as the financial crisis has become more noticeable and that Transport Service Factors had lower influence and users' satisfaction in 2011, when downturn was more intense. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Bus transit; customer satisfaction surveys; economic crisis; passengers' perceptions; service quality; structural equation model","Andalucia; Granada [Andalucia]; Spain; Mass transportation; Principal component analysis; Quality of service; Surveys; Transportation; Bus transits; Customer satisfaction survey; Economic crisis; Service Quality; Structural equation modeling; bus transport; financial crisis; metro system; metropolitan area; perception; principal component analysis; public transport; service quality; statistical analysis; survey; transportation economics; Customer satisfaction","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85020502146"

I focus on Alaska's salmon industry, which has weathered many ups and downs. In the early 2000s, despite strong wild salmon populations, the industry struggled as salmon prices sank to new lows. Drawing on ethnographic research in Bristol Bay, where most residents identify as Alaska Native, I show how salmon producers withstood volatile economic cycles by looking to ecological cycles, particularly the region's salmon returns, to interpret the fluctuations of capitalism and envision a future both within and beyond it. While fishers expressed senses of precariousness during the downturn through metaphors of extinction, they also undertook efforts to ""reinvent"" the industry, identifying in salmon cycles their own capacity to continue. Highlighting how dramatic ecological fluxes tune Bristol Bay producers to recurring change, I argue that this case reveals a more general pattern by which workers become oriented to ongoing instability. As they draw on experiences forged beyond the terms of capitalism to engage within it, their responses help maintain its cycles but also bolster their ability to persist in its midst. © 2015 by the American Anthropological Association.","Alaska; Capitalism; Crisis; Fishing; Natural Resources","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84924040464"

The model is populated by heterogenous firms, consumers, and banks that locally interact in different markets. In particular, banks provide credit to firms according to a Basel II or III macro-prudential frameworks and manage their liquidity in the interbank market. The Central Bank performs monetary policy according to different types of Taylor rules. We find that the model endogenously generates market freezes in the interbank market, which interact with the financial accelerator, possibly leading to firm bankruptcies, banking crises and the emergence of deep downturns. This requires the timely intervention of the Central Bank as a liquidity lender of last resort. Moreover, we find that the joint adoption of a three mandate Taylor rule tackling credit growth and the Basel III macro-prudential framework is the best policy mix to stabilize financial and real economic dynamics. However, as the Liquidity Coverage Ratio spurs financial instability by increasing the pro-cyclicality of banks’ liquid reserves, a new counter-cyclical liquidity buffer should be added to Basel III to improve its performance further. Finally, we find that the Central Bank can also dampen financial instability by employing a new unconventional monetary-policy tool involving active management of the interest-rate corridor in the interbank market. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Agent-based models; Basel III regulation; Financial instability; Interbank market freezes; Macro-prudential policy; Monetary policy; Tinbergen principle","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85086922659"

For this, secondary research was adopted in which secondary data were collected through an inclusive literature review. This review consists of tourism journals, newspaper articles, blogs, World Health Organization statistics, governmental data and website materials. In early 2020, the rapidly spreading Covid-19 (coronavirus) pandemic has wreaked global disaster. With no vaccine and limited medical capacity to treat the disease is a big challenge to the world. International, national and regional travel restrictions immediately affected the tourism industry. Even war, economic downturn, terrorist attack and various other diseases are all futile to cause an absolute decline in overall (international and domestic) tourism like Covid-19. This virus has enormous impacts on the tourism industry as the most crowded tourist destinations or overtourism in the world are deserted due to shut borders, no domestic or international flights or transport systems, and mix up to deal with the biggest impact in the history of the world - Covid-19. Overtourism means an extreme number of tourists at a specific destination at a particular point of time, or the excessive spread of people at various tourist spots has led to a situation known as overtourism. Due to Covid-19, the economic consequences on many destinations will be harsh, but some destinations suffering from overtourism might feel short-term relief, but it is a big hit in the long run. Overtourism will take a back seat during the crisis. Now post-Covid-19, people will be very particular while choosing their holiday destinations; likewise, there will be a shift from mass tourism to alternative tourism. Only a few people will wish a return to overtourism. © 2021 by Emerald Publishing Limited.","alternative tourism; Covid-19; destination; mass tourism; Overtourism; pandemic; tourism","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85130290204"

The creditworthiness of borrowers is evaluated by assessing their hard and soft information. However, microfinance borrowers are very sensitive to a local economic downturn and extreme (weather or climate) events. Therefore, this paper is devoted to extending the standard credit scoring models by taking into account the spatial dependence in credit risk. We estimate a credit scoring model with spatial random effects using the distance matrix based on the borrowers’ locations. We find that including the spatial random effects improves the ability to predict defaults and non-defaults of both individual and group loans. Furthermore, we find that several loan characteristics and demographic information are important determinants of individual loan default but not group loans.

Motivated by this literature, we explore the role of sustainability of organizational IT capability (ITC) on a firm's performance during an economic downturn. Specifically, we examine how ITC sustainability contributes to a firm's ability to recover from losses. ITC sustainability reflects a firm's ability to resist competitors' attempts to imitate or improve on its ITC. We use ITC sustainability to classify firms as sustainable (Systematic ITC), as non-sustainable (Occasional ITC), and as having no ITC (Non-ITC). Using a sample of large U.S. firms during the economic downturn of the early 2000s, we show that Systematic ITC firms achieve higher levels of firm-specific abnormal earnings and are capable of faster recovery when compared to all competitors (Occasional ITC and Non-ITC firms) and competitors with only Occasional ITC.","Firm-specific abnormal earnings; IT capability; Loss recovery","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-83455235244"

The causes of this crisis have been discussed from many aspects including mismanagement of the powerful chaebol and inefficient banking system. One of the main causes can be traced to ethical issues. Lee and Glain claim that the entire society of South Korea is corrupt and no one can do business without bribes. They insist that the unethical behavior of Koreans has caused Korea to lose its competitive edge and so has contributed to the significant downturn of the Korean economy. There are numerous examples of bribes in South Korea. Mr. Roh Tae Woo, former president of South Korea, received a slush fund of $650 million in concealed contributions while he was president from 1988 to 1993. Former trade minister Ahn Byong Hwa was sentenced to three years in prison for accepting more than one million dollars in bribes. One businessman paid 30 million won ($37,500 at $1=800 won, currently $1=1,164 won) to government officials as bribes while he was applying for a permit to build a factory plant valued at 130 million won ($162,500). The unethical behavior of Koreans is not unique in that people in other parts of the world, including Asia, Europe, and the United States, are not exempt from the unethical behavior of corruption and bribes. The purpose of this paper is to examine the ambiguity that exists in South Korea between offering gifts and offering bribes within the context of Oriental culture.","","South Korea; banking; corruption; ethics; financial crisis; national economy","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0035724783"

Using US data, we estimate the long-run and short-run income elasticities of air passenger demand and we estimate how they vary over the business cycle. We find that long-run income elasticities are lower than short-run elasticities and that the short-run elasticities are lower during the recovery period following an economic downturn. A reduction in income elasticity of demand during the recovery period is consistent with an increase in precautionary savings. We then apply our results to IMF economic forecasts, and our analysis suggests that a return of the air traffic to its pre-crisis levels would be slower that the return of economic activities to their levels. Forecasts using our estimates are likely to be more accurate than one based on constant income elasticities of demand and suggest that air traffic in the US would return to its 2019 level in 2025, which is three years after the recovery of real GDP in this scenario. The use of state dependent income elasticities – in conjunction with other techniques that can control for other likely changes in demand and supply in a post-COVID world – could play an important role in helping to generate better forecasts for the aviation industry. © 2021","Airline demand; Airline traffic forecast; Bi-directional causality; COVID-19; Impact of recession; Income elasticities","United States; air transportation; COVID-19; economic activity; forecasting method; income; traffic management; travel demand","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85115622319"

M. Kim 1997; Moon 1995).The state cultivated and patronized the private sector under broadly defined developmental objectives, while private firms, especially chaebol, served as the agents of economic growth and transformation. Unity of purpose as well as dense, organic networks between the public and private sectors fostered economic growth by mitigating uncertainty, expediting the flow of information, and reducing transaction costs. The 1997 economic crisis and subsequent structural reforms have radically restructured the political-economic terrain of business-government relations. Neoliberal reforms shattered the organic and symbiotic ties between the two, pitting the state against business. While the state was blamed for excessive intervention and poor monitoring, the private sector, especially the chaebol, did their part with poor corporate governance, reckless corporate expansion and high leveraging. The collusive ties between business and government were seen as the source of the rent-seeking, corruption and moral hazard that aggravated the economic downturn (Haggard and Mo 2000; Moon and Mo 2000;Yoo 1999, 2000; Jang 1999). President Kim Dae-jung, who took office in February 1998, had a mandate to manage the economic crisis through sweeping corporate reforms. The International Monetary Fund (IMF), which had coordinated a rescue financing of $57 billion in November 1997, sought extensive corporate reforms, including transparency and accountability in corporate governance, improved corporate financial structure, and overall corporate restructuring. © Cambridge University Press 2003.","","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84923459809"

We then present a small open economy model with productivity shocks and countercyclical interest rates. The model incorporates a working capital requirement and the Jaimovich and Rebelo (2009) preference that allows for flexible parameterization of the strength of income effects on labor supply. The model can account for the high volatility of wage and consumption relative to output and countercyclical trade balances that characterize emerging-market economies. During economic downturns, rising interest rates in emerging markets induce relatively large income effects on labor supply, so households would not reduce their labor input as much even though wages drop significantly. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.","Business cycles; Cyclical wage; Emerging market economies; Interest rates","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-80052277538"

It is thus one of the most important to understand. Objective: This paper reports the first cross-country study of the links between physical pain and the state of the economy. A key issue examined is how the level of pain in a society is influenced by the unemployment rate. Methods: The study uses pooled cross-sectional Gallup data from 146 countries (total N > 1.3 million). It estimates fixed-effects regression equations that control for personal characteristics. Results: More than a quarter of the world's citizens are in physical pain. Physical pain is lower in an economic boom and greater in an economic downturn. Estimated effect sizes are substantial. Remarkably, increases in pain are borne almost exclusively by women and found principally in rich nations. These findings have paradoxical aspects. The counter-cyclicality of physical pain is not what would be predicted by conventional economic analysis: during an expansion, people typically work harder and longer, and accidents and injuries increase. Nor are the study results due to unemployed citizens experiencing more pain (although they do). Instead, the study's findings are consistent with an important hypothesis proposed recently, using different kinds of evidence, by brain and behavioural-science researchers (e.g., Wiech and Tracey, 2009; Chou et al.; 2016). The hypothesis is that economic worry can create physical pain. Conclusions: This study provides the first cross-country evidence that the level of physical pain in a nation depends on the state of the economy. Pain is high when the unemployment rate is high. That is not because of greater pain among people who lose their jobs — it extends far beyond that into wider society. The increase in physical pain in a downturn is experienced disproportionately by women. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Business Cycle; Gender; Physical pain; State of the economy; Unemployment","Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Pain; Unemployment; business cycle; economic analysis; gender; regression analysis; unemployment; womens employment; accident; adult; Article; behavior assessment; controlled study; country economic status; cross-sectional study; economic development; economic security; evidence based practice; female; human; injury severity; male; pain assessment; pain severity; physical disease; physical pain; sex difference; unemployment; pain; unemployment","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85114431674"

Variants of the index are applied to a panel of more than 300 large UK charities in the Culture, Sport and Recreation sector for the period 2002-2007. The findings are that by 2008 these charities were in a stronger financial position than they had been in 2002 and were therefore better prepared to face the onset of the so-called credit crunch recession. © 2012 International Society for Third-Sector Research and The John's Hopkins University.","Financial exposure; Financial vulnerability; Nonprofits; UK charities","United Kingdom; economic growth; financial provision; financial system; nongovernmental organization; vulnerability","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84880994014"

In the eyes of young Indian craft entrepreneurs, digital technology is essential for surviving the crisis and would help, for the most part, the artisanal and handmade goods market and the entrepreneurial spirit. Fifty owners of online handicraft businesses, all of whom held unique craft skills, were interviewed using a qualitative technique, and the researcher then utilized inductive (qualitative) content analysis to draw out common threads from the transcripts. The findings showed that the Pandemic's internal and external factors encourage the movement of handicraft businesses to digital platforms, fostering entrepreneurship and digital innovation. The respondents identified several obstacles, including a lack of available high-quality digital infrastructures, the spread of pandemics, market worries over digital platforms, and the lack of knowledge and IT skills required to run an online business. The article's findings contribute to the growing body of digital information on novel approaches to entrepreneurship and suggest avenues for carrying out quantitative research toward the end of creating aid programmes for proprietors of handmade goods enterprises during economic downturns. This could serve as a standard against which new policies and tactics for reviving the economy and expanding the handmade goods industry through technological and entrepreneurial ingenuity can be measured. © 2023 WITPress.

Detailed analyses of the development of the planning systems in Latvia after the disintegration of the Soviet Union and restoration of independence (in 1991) are used to trace changes in public perception of urban planning over two decades during both economic upturns and downturns, beginning with the transition period from centralised planning during the totalitarian era to an inclusive planning system in a democratic society. Economic data describing the crisis and survey data gauging public reaction to them are used to synthesise evidence about public participation in urban planning exercises. Findings suggest that external factors strongly impact community perceptions of planning and that the public is willing to engage after first achieving individual goals. Events in Latvia in recent years suggest that crises serve as triggers for community engagement in planning and turning points in public perception of urban planning.","Baltic States; Centralised planning; Democratic planning; Economic crisis; Inclusive planning; Latvia; Neo-liberalism; Post-Soviet; Public participation; Public perception; Riga; Urban planning","Latvia; Riga; financial crisis; neoliberalism; participatory approach; perception; planning practice; planning system; post-communism; urban planning","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84959040284"

The early postcommunist transformation is examined in terms of a general transformational equation. The author provides a cross-sectional explanation of early differences throughout the 21 countries both in the institutional transformation and in the transformational slump. Two complementary LISREL (linear structural equations) models show that a successful early postcommunist transformation means: 1) a quick resumption of macroeconomic balance and economic growth resting on, 2) genuine democratization and economic liberalization, and 3) higher levels of inherited modernization.","","democratisation; economic growth; economic performance; economic reform; national economy; post-communism","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0031871438"

Design/methodology/approach: The study uses random-effect models on a large panel dataset of Spanish manufacturing firms covering 2003 to 2015 to estimate the joint effects of municipality size and economic crisis on firm employment growth. Findings: The analysis reveals a positive association between family-managed firms and employment growth. However, this association is not uniform across space and time. When it considers location, the study finds that municipality size positively affects employment growth in family-managed firms but not in non-family firms. Additionally, while the study reveals that both firm types experience negative employment growth during the early stage of the global economic crisis (2007–08), it also finds that family-managed firms located in small municipalities downsize less than their non-family counterparts. Originality/value: This study provides new evidence on the resilience of family-managed firms during economic crises, particularly those located in geographically bounded settings, such as small municipalities. When an adverse event, such as an economic crisis, jeopardizes employment levels, the embedded and trust-based relationships, between a family firm and its community leads them to prioritize employees' claims. However, family-managed firms' commitment to preserve jobs in small municipalities cannot be maintained over the long term; this effect disappears if the economic crisis is protracted. This study sheds new light on family-managed firms' distinctive behavior toward with local communities. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Economic crisis; Embeddedness; Employment; Family firm; Manufacturing; Municipality; Proximity; Spain","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85086917285"

The present study addresses an open debate on whether economic downturns have pushed a change in the relative importance of resilience-based versus traditional CIs location factors. Considering the location choices of 6332 CIs Portuguese start-ups in the period 2005–2012, we found that: (1) the crisis brought changes in the relative importance of location factors, enhancing traditional CI location factors such as technology and diminishing the relevance of resilience-based factors related to regions industrial specialisation; (2) resilience-based factors, such as industrial diversity, higher education, cultural and social networking and traditional CI factors, namely lower social inequality and life quality, were robust drivers for the emergence of new start-ups all over the period; and (3) although cultural policy significantly and positively support the emergence of new CIs start-ups in the crisis period, the austerity period reversed that role. Our results suggest that the sustainable development of regions implies encompassing public stimulus to the generation of a diversified, interdependent network of creative activities, able to enhance innovation through their own synergies and linkages with the rest of the economy. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.","","Portugal; creative industry; economic instability; industrial development; industrial location; location decision; spatial analysis","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85101777695"

Using matched employer-employee panel data for Portugal covering the period 1986-2004, real wages are shown to be considerably more procyclical during recessions than during expansions, resulting in relatively moderate overall levels of cyclicality (about -0.6). However, most of the procyclicality during downturns is shown to be driven by the younger employees, as older workers appear to be insulated from the business cycle. Moreover, movers between firms typically display higher cyclicality than workers that stay in the same firm, regardless of whether the latter move or not between job levels. Most results also hold when considering basic wages instead of total wages, except that the procyclicality of movers during downturns is substantially higher. © 2007 Scottish Economic Society.","Matched employer-employee data; Wage rigidity; Worker mobility","Eurasia; Europe; Portugal; Southern Europe; business cycle; heterogeneity; labor relations; panel data; wage; working conditions","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-35748985601"

Theoretical considerations suggest that consolidations should reduce the public's support for their governments, but empirical studies have found surprisingly small effects on government support. However, most of these studies analyze electoral outcomes, which are separated from the consolidation by a multi-link causal chain. We argue that more direct measures of government support, such as executive approval, show much stronger negative effects of consolidation, since they are less affected by the strategic timing of consolidations or the political alternatives on offer. We analyze a time series cross-sectional dataset of executive approval in 14 Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries from 1978 to 2014, using the narrative approach to measure fiscal consolidations. We find that spending cuts decrease government approval, especially during economic downturns, but tax increases' impact on approval remains minimal. Finally, left-and right-wing governments are equally likely to lose approval after implementing austerity.  © ","approval; austerity; economic crisis; fiscal consolidations; public opinion","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85103717568"

Ownership has been transferred to some 500,000 state rental low income households and a capital subsidy scheme has assisted approximately three million low income households since the early 1990s. At the same time mortgage finance became available to black households during the mid 1980s. Since the mid 1980s, a concerted effort was made to increase housing finance to the historically disadvantaged black population of South Africa.

More specifically, we consider who has moved into homeownership and who has moved out of it and the reasons for having done so. We conclude that, in the initial phase in 2008 (because of increased interest rates), low-income black respondents had been more likely either to redeem their mortgages or to move out of homeownership and into rental housing.

We use a life-course perspective to examine change in prestige, education, earning potential, and sex type dimensions in occupational aspirations in the U.S., using longitudinal data on cohorts of young people ages 14-29 during the period between 1966 and 1980. After their initial formation in childhood and adolescence, occupational aspirations are regulated by experiences in the educational system, the labor market, and for women, the adult family. The Civil Rights and the Women's Movements contributed to age-, cohort-, and period-related increases in women and black men's occupational aspirations. The economic downturn after 1973 also played a role, reducing young men's occupational aspirations and reverting black men's aspirations to the same level as that prior to the 1970s, negating the positive influences of the Civil Rights Movement. There is no evidence that the Vietnam War produced a net change in young people's aspirations. These findings show that after their initial formation under ascriptive influences, occupational aspirations continue to evolve as new life experiences associated with changed societal values and opportunity structure provide impetus for change. Despite these perturbations, socioeconomic background, race, and gender retain a pervasive impact on the regulation of young people's aspirations in adolescent and young adulthood in the United States. © 2007 International Sociological Association Research Committee 28 on Social Stratification and Mobility.","Age-cohort-period effects; Civil Rights Movement; Labor market; Life course; Occupational aspirations; Women's Movement","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-38149064401"

Second, being primed on the poor public health record of the Trump administration reduced its electoral prospects among citizens between 55 and 70 years old. We conclude that the 2020 election was a normal contest compatible with theories of economic voting and political competence. Our results suggest that democratic accountability can be a powerful determinant of the fate of populist leaders once in power. © 2022 Cambridge University Press.

To develop this argument, the analysis builds on observation during fieldwork in Doha between 2015 and 2016, and is enriched by a textual analysis of primary and secondary sources.

Matching a unique dataset on bank branch-level and firm-level information for a sample of 33,165 French manufacturing firms over the 2005–2013 period, we rely on two alternative indicators to capture different dimensions of SMEs financial constraints and find significant differences in the drivers of these constraints. While higher market share of regional banks or stronger presence of geographically-focused banks helps to alleviate SMEs' short-term credit constraint, higher market share of national banks or stronger presence of geographically-diversified banks is beneficial to reduce SMEs investment cash-flow sensitivity. Moreover, in both cases, SMEs' financial constraints are strengthened in functionally-distant markets. In addition, during crisis times, the benefits of relationship banking on short-term credit constraint remain and, in some cases, are reinforced. We also find that these benefits differ according to SMEs pre-crisis financial health. Regional banks facilitate access to short term credit for firms which were more profitable before the global financial crisis and particularly those who experienced a sharp decline in profitability in troubled times, supporting the hypothesis of continuation lending by relationship banks during economic downturns. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Financial crisis; Local banking market structure; Relationship lending; SME financial constraints","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85086004532"

The analysis reveals a remarkably resilient impact of social capital and its constituent components during the economic downturn. However, this resilience is much less pronounced when the focus is on countries where the crisis was most severe, suggesting an economic development threshold below which certain social capital components lose their associational impact. However, religious activity is significantly associated with workers’ job satisfaction in these economies, providing comfort during times of socio-economic difficulty. The extent of organizational trust, measured by proxy variables for participative decision-making, has by far the strongest association with job satisfaction. This suggests that employers need to think again about the way they treat their employees to maximize the benefits of social capital and, ultimately, improve the job satisfaction scores of their workers. © 2014, © The Author(s) 2014.","Economic crisis; Europe; job satisfaction; social capital","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84940917716"

South Africa has long been a township/slum tourism destination due to the inequalities caused by apartheid. During the later apartheid years and after the fall of apartheid in 1994, the once upmarket financial centre of inner city Johannesburg took a major economic downturn and has since been considered by many a ‘no-go zone’. Since 2012, a number of tour operators have begun to develop walking tours taking visitors into the inner city of Johannesburg. Some research has argued that tourism in Johannesburg’s inner city is a form of slum tourism. However, we argue that the inner city of Johannesburg is diverse, vast and complex, and therefore these walking tours should not necessarily be grouped with the concept of slum tourism. The research to justify this argument is multifaceted. First, definitions of slum tourism are explored against the backdrop of the Johannesburg inner city. Second, in-depth interviews were conducted with five tour operators that run inner city walking tours. Finally, 100 tourists were surveyed to determine their perceptions of inner city Johannesburg and whether or not they consider it to be a slum. The results demonstrate that although some commonalities exist between slum tourism and inner city walking tours, particularly the goal of de-stigmatisation, walking tours in the Johannesburg inner city should, arguably, not be considered a form of slum tourism. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Frenzel; Inner city; Johannesburg; Slum tourism; Walking tours","Gauteng; Johannesburg; South Africa; apartheid; complexity; informal settlement; inner city area; perception; questionnaire survey; socioeconomic conditions; tourism; tourist destination; walking","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85017124113"

The labor methods applied provide evidence on the shadow economy in the economies studied. The study shows that BiH suffers the most from the phenomenon of the shadow economy (averaging over 30 percent of the official GDP in the period 1999-2001), which is somewhat anticipated due to its lower level of economic development, higher rates of unemployment, and devastating consequences of war. For Croatia and Slovenia (averaging around 27 and 20 percent in the post-2000 period, respectively), on the other hand, shadow-economy activities have been, on average, on a downturn since 1994. This is in line with expectations, as economic growth and socioeconomic development are believed to hinder shadow-economy activities. © 2007 M.E. Sharpe, Inc.

We examine how firms with EO programs weathered the recessions of 2001 and 2008 in terms of employment stability relative to firms without EO programs, and also whether such firms were less likely to lay off workers when faced with negative shocks more broadly. In our econometric analyses, we use a rich array of measures of EO at firms, including the presence of EO stock in pension plans, the presence of employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs), the value of EO stock per employee, the share of the firm owned by employees, the share of workers at the firm participating in EO and the share of workers at the firm participating in ESOPs. We also consider both economy-wide negative shock measures (increases in the unemployment rate, declines in the employment-to-population ratio) and firm-specific negative shock measures (declines in firm sales, declines in firm stock price).

These findings suggest that politicians, regulators, and banks use opaque financial reporting to facilitate regulatory forbearance. Moreover, we show that opacity is a significant channel through which BC senators increase bank risk.

This paper investigates differences in the perceived impact of the economic crisis between adults in households with and without children in 17 European countries, using data from the Life in Transition Survey 2010 in a multilevel modelling framework. It also explores differences in the coping strategies that households adopted to deal with the decline in income or economic activity. Everything else being equal, perceptions of the crisis were more widespread in countries with higher rates of child poverty, lower economic growth and lower GDP per capita. Across countries, perceptions of the crisis closely trailed subjective indicators of financial difficulties from other international surveys conducted in 2010. Adults in households with children were more likely to report an impact of the crisis, with larger differences in countries with higher rates of monetary child poverty. Adults in households with children also adopted a greater variety of coping strategies than the rest, prioritizing expenditure on basic necessities, while cutting back on luxuries and holidays. Nevertheless, many still reported reduced consumption of staple foods as a result of economic difficulties. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Children; Economic crisis; Household coping strategies; Subjective impact","Europe; coping strategy; economic activity; economic instability; financial crisis; household income; income distribution; perception; regional economy; socioeconomic survey","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84926339544"

A long-standing pattern in needs satisfaction implies constant activity and employment. To substantiate our hypothesis theoretically, we resort to the evolutionary interpretation of the firm as a problem solver and to the literature on organizational resilience. We test the hypothesis using the data released by the Italian Institute of Statistics for all Italian enterprises in the 1996–2008 pre-crisis and 2008–15 crisis periods. Dynamic multifactor partitioning confirms that in Italy, all typologies of co-operatives withstood the crisis better than other business forms did and that co-operatives were affected the least by economic cyclicality and employment loss. © 2021 Edgard Milhaud Foundation.","co-operative enterprises; economic crisis; employment stabilization; members’ needs; multifactor partitioning; organizational resilience","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85108870726"

Since labor accounts for a sizeable share of the variable costs of mining, a mine that enters a recession with relatively high labor productivity and that manages during the recession to raise its labor productivity should be more likely than other mines to avoid cutbacks and closure. The US copper industry over the 1975-90 period provides empirical support for this expectation. But surprisingly, it also suggests that mine survival depends (a) more on labor productivity than variable costs, and (b) more on the ability of a mine to increase its labor productivity once in a recession than on a high level of labor productivity at the start of a recession. An important factor affecting the extent to which mines increase labor productivity once in a recession is the life expectancy of their reserves. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

While studies of HRM during economic downturns are limited, the global impact of COVID-19 on employment adds impetus to the debate. Though downsizing and mass layoffs attract most attention, redundancies are just one potential response to challenging economic conditions, and various other employment adjustments might be viewed as complements or alternatives to workforce reductions. However, little is known about the implementation of HR practices or enactment of HR strategies during recession. Drawing upon 56 in-depth interviews, this article presents three case studies of recessionary restructuring in British manufacturing firms. The cases share a concern with mitigating redundancies and highlight the importance of actor agency as well as institutional and organisational context in shaping restructuring outcomes.

The economic downturns resulting in job losses and the housing crisis have converged to create a new group of families who were managing to remain out of poverty prior to the recession but are now slipping into poverty, putting additional strain on services. In light of these pressing issues, this article synthesizes the literature examining child poverty to take a long-range view of the relationship between economic strain, system involvement, and impacts on children and the systems attempting to serve these children. The effectiveness of various policy and program efforts aimed at reducing child poverty rates and/or ameliorating the negative effects of living in poverty is reviewed.

The beneficial effects of creditor rights during recessions are stronger for firms that are more likely to have severe shareholder-bondholder agency problems. We also find that during recessions (relative to expansions) strong creditor rights are associated with a smaller decline in net capital flows. Our findings are consistent with credit market frictions increasing during recessions, and with stronger creditor rights decreasing the negative effects of these frictions.

It has not only distressed the socio-economic structure of the world but also mounted enormous pressure on the governmental bodies to save the lives of the people. Despite this, severe impacts of the same have been observed on the small and medium manufacturing enterprises (SMME) practices, resulting in the economic downturn. The purpose of this study is to facilitate the SMME’s with circular economy (CE) practices to overcome the negative impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak on their supply chain (SC) operations. Design/methodology/approach: The presented work identified seven critical impacts as criteria of the novel COVID-19 pandemic on the Indian SMME and seeks to identify the relief measures in the CE paradigm by identifying 13 prominent enablers to CE as alternatives. Experts’ opinions have been engaged to detect CE enablers’ proficiency to overpower the pandemic impact through a questionnaire-based survey. The obtained data have been clustered and analyzed through a hybrid approach of entropy weight method and grey relational analysis to find an organized ranking of the enablers. Findings: Current work spotlights the SMME’s losses due to SC disruptions and declined consumption patterns. The waste augmentation during the pandemic era has also been grouped in this study, primarily associating with the SC’s waste generation. The result of the performed analysis shows that the CE enabler “waste reduction and its transformation into a resource (E1)” have achieved the highest rank among all the considered enablers, governing a higher demand toward reusing waste for better handling the post COVID era state of affairs. Originality/value: The presented study aimed to suppress the pandemic impact and generate anticipation of the CE concept, which might help the managers and policymakers identify its urgent need to achieve a stable and resilient SC system in a post COVID period. Presented work is peculiar, aiming to accelerate the CE adaption with green material usage in the industrial sector to suppress the present miserable condition and to achieve industrial and social sustainability for a better-foreseen future. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Circular economy (CE); Coronavirus; COVID-19; Entropy weight method (EWM); Grey relational analysis (GRA); Pandemic; Supply chain management; Sustainability","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85121812378"

This study aims to investigate the effect of supply chain finance (SCF) on corporate sustainability performance (CSP) and identifies SCF-related recipes for CSP. Design/methodology/approach: Based on a sample of 1,038 firms that disclose CSP – namely, corporate financial performance (CFP) and environmental, social and governance performance (ESGP) – the authors use a quasi-replication method consisting of empirical analysis with fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to investigate SCF’s effects on CSP. Findings: The authors find that SCF has a “doing well by doing good” effect on CSP. CFP can promote the positive effect of SCF and ESGP while ESGP’s positive effect on SCF and CFP is nonsignificant. In addition, heterogeneity tests show that SCF’s promoting effect on CSP is affected by high-low CFP and ESGP. The fsQCA results verify the empirical findings and reveal five SCF-related recipes for achieving high CSP. Research limitations/implications: This study has the following two limitations. First, we do not consider how SCF affects CSP in different industries. There is a need to investigate whether industry heterogeneity changes SCF’s effects on CSP, especially in prominent industries, such as the energy industry, with its high susceptibility to ESGP, and the manufacturing industry, with its extensive application of SCF. It will be important to investigate these industries to better understand SCF’s role in sustainability. Second, we study the secondary supply chain – namely, core firm–suppliers and core firm–customers. The authors do not consider financial institutions (e.g. banks and guarantee institutions). SCF modes that include the participation of financial institutions, such as factoring financing and reverse factoring financing, cater more to the capital needs of diversified firms. In the future, studying specific industries that have made significant contributions to the application of SCF along with others that are more sensitive to environmental governance could better highlight the effect of SCF on sustainability and help supply chain managers understand the application value of SCF. Future research could also extend SCF participants into multiple roles to explore separate effects. Tracking financing demanders, fund providers and credit guarantors could capture SCF characteristics more comprehensively. Methodologically, it will be challenging to accurately measure SCF networks in terms of quantification. In future work, this could be performed with the help of artificial intelligence. Practical implications: First, our findings indicate that SCF has a “doing well by doing good” effect on core firms. SCF can not only overcome the capital shortage of SMEs but also provide significant benefits to core firms. Second, our findings provide SCF-related recipes to help firms fulfil ESGP obligations without sacrificing CFP under the pressure to “do good.” The authors provide valuable insights and diverse recommendations to help supply chain managers, marketing executives and researchers adjust supply chain management strategies. Third, this work can guide executives in various fields to adopt SCF to achieve sustainability as a risk-mitigation strategy by means of marketing. Originality/value: This study identifies better, more straightforward SCF-related recipes for CSP (consisting of CFP and ESGP) using a quasi-replication analysis that improves upon conventional methods such as regression analysis, which have limited power. The authors provide valuable insights and diverse recommendations to help managers pursue sustainable development. The findings point to practical guidelines and feasible solutions that can support well-founded operational strategic and management decision-making, which can enhance a firm’s competitiveness under uncertainty and a sluggish economy. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Environmental; Financial performance; Recipe; social and governance performance; Supply chain finance; Sustainability performance","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85145904283"

We analyze aggregate data on travel, incomes, debt, public opinion, and Internet access. These data lack the precision of microdata, but unlike microdata are available annually for years before, during, and after driving’s decline. We find substantial evidence for the economic explanation. During the downturn the cost of driving rose while median incomes fell. The economy grew overall, but did so unequally. Mass driving requires a mass middle class, but economic gains accrued largely to the most affluent. We find less evidence for “peak car.” If Americans voluntarily drove less, they would likely use other modes more. However, despite heavy investment in bicycle infrastructure and public transportation in the 2000s, demand for these modes remained flat while driving fell. Takeaway for practice: If Americans were voluntarily abandoning automobiles for other modes, planners could reduce investments in automobile infrastructure and increase investments in alternative mobility. Driving’s decline, however, was not accompanied by a transit surge or substantial shift to other modes. The lesson of the driving downturn is that people drive less when driving’s price rises. Planners obviously do not want incomes to fall, but they should consider policies that increase driving’s price. Planners might also rethink the current direction of U.S. transit policy; transit use did not rise even when driving fell at an unprecedented pace. © 2016, © American Planning Association, Chicago, IL.","","United States; class; cycle transport; economics; income; investment; public transport; transportation policy","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85008658871"

Then, housing needs among elderly and pre-elderly people appears to be overwhelmed by social needs such as attachment and existing social networks, along with direct or indirect financial constraints. Besides, spatial lock-in appears to be more prevalent among Chinese immigrants as compared to non-Chinese immigrants, owed to the former's ties to local Hong Kong residents and subsequent eligibility for government assistance. Yet, despite the availability of jobs and schools, the recent trend of people moving out of new towns gradually turns these areas into marginalized communities clustered with poor people, alienated within and in a sense excluded from the city landscape altogether.

The question, then, is, what executives should do to help their companies weather these downturns. As in so many instances, there are conventional approaches that appear to make sense in the short term. But while these approaches seem reasonable in the heat of the moment, they can eventually damage competitive positions and financial performance. Drawing on extensive research of Fortune 500 companies that have lived through industry downturns and economic recessions over the past two decades, Darrell Rigby, a director of Bain & Company, reveals how companies need to go against the grain of convention and exploit industry downturns to harness their unique opportunities for upward mobility. The author explains that every downturn goes through three phases. He examines each phase and shows how successful players navigate the huge waves of a downturn. Smart executives, he says, don't panic: they look bad news in the eye and institutionalize an approach to detecting storms. Rather than hedge their bets through diversification, they focus on their core businesses and spend to gain market share. They manage costs relentlessly during good times and bad. They keep a long-term view and strive to maintain the loyalty of employees, suppliers, and customers. And coming out of the downturn, they maintain momentum in their businesses to stay ahead of the competition they've already surpassed. Every industry will face periodic downturns of varying severity, says Rigby. But executives with the vision and ingenuity to take unconventional approaches can buoy their companies to new heights.","","Commerce; Economic Competition; Efficiency, Organizational; Inflation, Economic; Organizational Culture; Personnel Management; United States; article; commercial phenomena; economic aspect; economics; organization; organization and management; personnel management; United States","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0005594436"

Using a panel dataset of 32 Bangladeshi commercial banks over the period from 2000 to 2014, we find an inverse relationship between the business cycle and capital buffers, while a positive relationship between the business cycle and bank risk. These findings support the implementation of countercyclical capital buffers in Basel III Accord to ensure bank safety during economic downturns. We also observe that the bank efficiency positively responds to macroeconomic fluctuations. While examining the impact of capital buffers on bank behaviour, we find that low buffer banks raise the level of capital buffers and improve the efficiency over time. In contrast, high buffer banks incline to raise investment in risky projects by deterioration of capital ratios during economic upturns. In this case, high buffer banks in developing countries should take risk and efficiency issues into great consideration and force low capitalized banks to follow the Basel III guidelines more stringently to adjust capital buffers, risk and efficiency with macroeconomic bounce.

However, since economic values of patents may differ, simple patent counts may give misleading rankings, if the patents of one country are on average more valuable than those of another. In the literature several methods have been proposed, which shall adjust for these differences. However, often these do not possess a solid economic micro-foundation and therefore are often ad-hoc and arbitrary procedures. In this paper, we intend to present an adjustment method that is based on the analysis of renewal decisions. The method builds on the theoretical model used in Schankerman and Pakes (1986) and Besson (2008) but goes beyond both approaches in that it recovers the important long tail of the value distribution. It also transfers Besson's (2008) econometric methodology (applicable to the organisational structures of the US Patent and Trademark Office) also to the European Patent Office which is necessary, since each application here may split up into several national patent documents. The analysis is performed for 22 countries. Exemplarily, we find that in the cohort of 1986 patent applications, Danish patents are about 60% more valuable than the average patent. German patents are a bit below average. Japanese patents are of least value. In the cohort of 1996, Danish patents lose some of their lead but are still more valuable than the average. While German are a bit above average, Japanese patents even fall further behind (possibly due to the economic downturn in since the mid of 1990ies). © 2011 Akadémiai Kiadó.","Adjustment; Patent count; Renewal fees; Value","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-80051469407"

Using decennial census data from 2000, this paper examines the nexus of these trends by examining characteristics of Latino baby boomers. In the census data, Latinos constituted 10% of the 80 million boomers; roughly one-third of Latino boomers (37%) were born in the United States or abroad to a U.S. parent; 6% were born in a U.S. territory; 21% were naturalized citizens; and 36% were noncitizens. Compared to non-Latinos, Latino baby boomers had lower levels of education, home ownership, and investment income and higher rates of material hardship and poverty; however, there was considerable variation based on citizenship status.

Using official statistics and a literature review, the present study documents the inherent demographic decline in metropolitan Athens (Greece) as a response to economic stagnation after a long-lasting expansion. The empirical results of our study delineate metropolitan shrinkage in Southern Europe as a process associated with complex socioeconomic conditions leading to (possibly counterintuitive) demographic outcomes as far as migration trends are concerned. Recession has determined unsustainable economic conditions especially for non-native population segments, promoting both class and ethnic segregation. The negative migration balance in the 2010s led to an intense population decline hitting settlements made already demographically fragile because of low fertility and aging. Athens became a sort of ‘migrant trap’, being progressively unattractive for incoming migration flows—both internal and international—and losing an increasingly high number of non-native residents settling in the area, especially during the ‘gold’ decade of the 2004 Olympics. A sudden reduction in immigration rates reflected both economic (recession) and non-economic (population aging, fertility reduction, and childbearing postponement) factors, causing an incipient shrinkage after secular urban growth. The empirical results of our study add to the traditional literature on ‘industrial cities shrinkage’ in Europe and contribute to (re)formulate short- and medium-term development scenarios in large agglomerations, shedding further light on the role of migration in crisis-driven processes of urban decline in Mediterranean Europe. © 2022 by the authors.","economic downturns; Europe; migration; population shrinkage; social inequalities","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146655833"

Real wages are weakly procyclical in Spain and focusing on differences in different phases of the business cycle, we find that differences across expansions and recessions are significant, with an even lower real wage cyclicality in recessions. Furthermore, higher levels of unemployment do not translate into additional real wages adjustments when the economy is contracting, while lower levels of unemployment during expansions have incremental effects on wage elasticity. This general result holds after accounting for differences in tenure, type of contract and age categories. Nevertheless, wages of newly-hired workers are the most sensitive to the business cycle and exhibit the lowest asymmetric pattern between expansions and recessions. At the other end, wages of workers with more than six years of tenure can be characterized as the most protected against economic downturns.

In several developing countries, remittances exceed the receipts from the export of goods and services, and even capital flows such as Foreign Institutional Investment, Foreign Direct Investment, and Official Development Assistance. Remittances are known for their countercyclical nature during the sharp economic downturns, compared to other financial flows that are typically procyclical. Hence, it is known as a possible financing source for economic evolution in emerging economic systems. It is essential to determine the elements that drive remittances, as it may enable us to channelize this inflow to reap its developmental potential efficiently. Several macroeconomic determinants of remittances are well researched in the literature by researchers around the globe. However, not even a single study has been given to the financial development, determinants of remittances in the Indian setting. Therefore, this survey is a humble effort to bridge this gap. We utilize multiple regression and autoregressive distributed lag approach to cointegration which finds that several financial developments and financial openness variables have a substantial impact on remittances in the short run as well as in the long run. In accession to that, we incorporate each dummy variable for the global financial crisis and the concurrent negative oil price shock and negative output shock in the host nations.

Furthermore, the paper seeks to identiy critical impacts upon the festival and event industry as a result of this crisis and to identify strategies to help members of the industry positively advance in the future. Festival and event industry professionals were surveyed electronically about their business performance during the current global recession and about their potential strategies for coping in the short term and long term. It was found that about the half of respondents' profit margins decreased during the recent financial crisis. The respondents indicated that primary factors that impacted the decrease were reduced available sponsorship funding and the general effects of economic recession on all other revenue sources. The festival and event professionals expected the industry to grow and perform at a very conservative pace over the two years (2011 and 2012) following the recession. The strategies that the festival and event professionals intended to use to build successful businesses following the recession were “increase marketing efforts,” “work to reduce expenses overall,” and “increase the use of technology”. The findings of this study solely reflect the US festival and event industry. The significant contribution of this study is the analysis and understanding of the direct impact of the recent recession on the festival and event industry and also providing additional knowledge of changes being made by the industry in direct response to the economic recession of 2007-2009. The paper describes the first study of its kind to measure the direct impact of the global recession on the festival and event industry. The findings provide a guide to assist festival and event leaders to make better decisions to deal with both the current recession and future downturns.

METHODS Using microdata from the Residential Variation Statistics for 2006-2013, we estimate the rates of interregional migration and the different forms of international emigration, including return migration and remigration. We used multinomial regressions. RESULTS Return migration and emigration to an unknown destination increased significantly with respect to interregional mobility at early and late stages of the crisis. In contrast, interregional migration was more likely than international emigration before the first stage. Regardless of birthplace, Spanish citizenship is an asset for mobility within Spain and the EU for all foreign-born individuals, and for emigration to non-EU countries for Cubans. Finally, emigration to an unknown destination resembles return migration in its composition by sex, age, and origin. CONTRIBUTION First, we discuss the chronology of migration responses, while showing that the prevalence of each varies according to citizenship status and the stages of the economic downturn. Second, it notes the similarities between emigration to an unknown destination and return migration captured by the Spanish Residential Variation Statistics, supporting the argument that the former is a kind of return adopted by immigrants without Spanish citizenship. Third, although Spain is one of the European countries with a significant share of foreign-born populations and also one of the few countries with statistics to examine both internal migration and international emigration, this paper constitutes the first attempt to do so. © 2018 Prieto-Rosas, Recaño & Quintero-Lesmes.","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85050228584"

Ireland was one of the newer states to recruit labour internationally on a large scale from the late 1990s until the global economic downturn in 2008. Various forms of short-term migration, as well as both documented and undocumented employment, followed. This paper discusses the experience of Brazilian migrants in Ireland who assume particular interest because of being a new migration stream over a great distance, which involved relatively short sojourns in Ireland for many before returning to Brazil. Changing government work permit policies for non-European Economic Area citizens, European Union enlargement, and economic recession all contributed to reduce the opportunities for legal employment in Ireland. This paper is based on research with workers who were initially recruited for the agricultural processing sector in two small towns in western Ireland through an existing link with the province of Goiás in Brazil. The evidence differs from some other studies of international labour migration in that data collection took place in both Ireland and Brazil.

Current UK guidance about being physically active was published in 2011, during a period of intense economic downturn and ‘austerity’ welfare. Physical activity is known to be lowest among sectors of the population at the lower end of the social gradient, making marginalised and disadvantaged groups priorities for initiatives to raise activity levels. Although much emphasis was given to the robust scientific underpinning of the 2011 guidance, it failed to engage with either the national or global debate around health inequalities, and gave no consideration to the social processes affecting health. This paper considers this omission. It first overviews patterns of health inequalities and explains the potential contribution of physical activity to addressing them. It then reviews the content of UK physical activity guidance, examines the role of health behaviour research in informing them, and suggests a number of ways in which social science knowledge could have enhanced its analysis. The paper then considers the process of knowledge production which informed the guidance, and considers the value of incorporating research into the social determinants of health (SDH) into the evidence base that informs physical activity guidance. It concludes with suggestions about how this might be done. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","evidence; Health inequalities; knowledge production; physical activity; social determinants of health","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84994142395"

Between 2008 and 2013 national income fell by 9 per cent, per capita incomes by 11 per cent, and industrial production by 25 per cent; and unemployment doubled. In this essay we argue that, while this dramatic situation has been made worse by the policies of expansive austerity, its origins can be traced back to changes that took place in the 1990s (notably globalization, competition for emerging new markets and the diffusion of new technologies-ICT) to which Italy failed to react speedily or effectively by reorganizing its entire productive system. Instead, many of the reforms that have been introduced with respect to the labour market, for example, have reduced costs but in ways that have encouraged firms to stay in traditional sectors where products are poorly differentiated and of low technology content. If the Italian economy is not to become even weaker, new reforms are urgently needed to encourage innovative investment and push through to completion a restructuring of the industrial system that can no longer be deferred. © 2015 Taylor and Francis.","austerity; globalization; ICT; investment; Italy; labour marker reform; recession; stagnation; structural shock; technology","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84923928495"

The prolonged movement control orders, social distancing, and lockdowns have triggered the global economic downturn, disrupted the demand and supply chains, reduced the pool of workforce, and caused many jobs loss. This paper aims to analyze the global economic cost of the coronavirus pandemic, and its current and future implications. Design/methodology/approach: Based on contingency theory, this paper provides an in-depth analysis of the current situation on the global economic cost of the COVID-19 outbreak and gives insights from an organizational perspective. Findings: This paper found that the world has witnessed far-ranging economic consequences due to the coronavirus pandemic in four aspects: (i) decline in personal consumption; (ii) decline in the investments and stock prices in capital market; (iii) decline in government spending in developmental projects and increase in new borrowing; and (iv) decline of exports of goods to international markets. Originality/value: The novelty lies in investigating the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on micro and macroeconomic levels — the components of GDP, consumer behavior, business investments, government spending, and global exports. The paper suggests the need for urgent actions by the world leaders to oversee, anticipate, and manage the risks and cushion the economic consequences. It concludes that the flexibility and adaptability of leaders, effectiveness, workforce protection, efficient use of modern technology, including automation and artificial intelligence, would enhance the resilience of supply chains which will support organizations to sustain in this critical time. © 2021, Mian M.

Since the global luxury market is comprised of customer segments with relatively homogeneous needs, wants and motivations, achieving a global luxury brand positioning will help mitigate the negative consequences of economic crises, regardless of the market in which a luxury brand operates. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach – A survey instrument was administered to a sample of 200 professionals located in a European country where none of the global brands cited in the paper are originating. The country was also selected on the basis of its propensity to have local luxury brands in competition with the global brands in each of the categories tested. The survey was conducted during the peak of economic crisis in Europe. Findings – This study provides evidence that brand globalness may be a major value creating factor, and thus a source of competitive advantage for luxury brands competing in the global marketplace. Another question addressed by this study is should the luxury brand modulate the message projected in the media away from luxury and closer to quality or other stimuli less associated with luxury in order to avoid luxury shame. All these are questions addressed by this imperial study to investigate how the brand globalness influences consumer perceptions in global recessionary times. Originality/value – The proposed research formulates an empirical study of the underlining effects of what is referred to as “glocalization” in the literature on the luxury positioning.

Today, most of the retrenchment has stopped and in some areas we can see tendencies of restoration - but more so in financial benefits than in the caring sectors. In the article this process is discussed as a process of reallocation where general principles of solidarity become manifest. Various levels of decision making are discussed within the context of socio-political action. Current transitions in Swedish health care are described with respect to coverage rates, content, marketisation and distribution. Basic principles of distribution are highlighted in order to analyse the meaning of social solidarity in a concrete allocative setting. The significance of popular opinion - it's shifts and determinants - is also considered.

Researchers into issues relating to the efficiency of enterprises' functioning focus their interest on comprehensively describing efficiency indicators and determining the factors influencing it. There continues to be insufficient work on measuring efficiency and the extent to which it is limited by types of economic growth (development), based on the theory of marginal product of George Clark and the results of multiple models of production and trade functions (P. Douglas, R. Solow, E. Denison, Harrod, Samuelson-Hicks, Domar and others). Therefore, this study focuses on the process of assessing the effectiveness of trading enterprises in the trade sector in 2010-18 in conditions of economic growth and an economic downturn. This article aims to examine the models of efficient functioning of trading enterprises in conditions of economic growth. It is evidenced that the criterion for measuring efficiency is the evaluation of static and dynamic efficiency of trade activities, which allows changes in the used assets to be taken into account and testifies to the integration of diminishing returns and economic fluctuations in macro and microsystems. The article shows that in order to qualitatively and completely evaluate the efficiency of the functioning of trading enterprises, it is necessary to consider all possible factors. According to Clark's law, the authors substantiate an approach to evaluating performance based on simple one-factor models; the approach evidences that future studies seeking ways to improve efficiency, but that focus on changes in resources, will be erroneous, unjustified, and will most likely reduce the effectiveness of the resource under study. This model will help: determine and forecast the efficiency of enterprises at any point in the economic cycle; provide the necessary information on the required amount of investment, on depreciation rates, and on the optimal amount of labour potential of an enterprise; and define the volume of expected income during economic crisis or recovery. Some applied recommendations in terms of managing the efficiency of trading enterprises are aimed at solving the methodological problem of constructing isoquant maps for a particular product line group and at selecting the optimal predictor for forecasting trade processes. The practical value of the proposed model also lies in improving the parameters of positioning of the enterprise's goods in target market segments, reducing operating costs, accelerating the turnover of inventories and withdrawing illiquid current assets, and increasing the efficiency of retail areas. © 2021 Olha Ilyash et al., published by Sciendo 2021.","diminishing marginal product; efficiency; input / output resources; parametrisation; specification; trade activity function; trading enterprises","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85103825654"

When Japan's bubble economy burst in 1991-92, the sharp fall in the stock market and land values made a significant economic downturn - or at least a period of sluggish growth (by Japanese standards) - inevitable. Bad loans in the banking system, associated with the collapsing value of real estate and equity collateral, proliferated and impaired bank capital. The sharp decline in household wealth caused consumer expenditures to fall. Excess capacity induced business firms to curtail investment. Such economic travail is hardly surprising when asset bubbles burst. GDP growth since 1991 has averaged less than 1 per cent per year - and was sharply negative in 1998 with negligible growth in 1999. Yet, among industrial countries, Japan had been the premier growth economy for the previous four decades. With the world's highest saving rates and seemingly endless capacity to adapt to, and dramatically augment, the latest industrial technologies, Japan's GDP grew at 6 to 12 per cent in the 1950s and 60s - and at a robust 3 to 5 per cent in the 1970s and 80s, when the rest of the industrial world was comparatively stagnant. Moreover, these basic virtues of private industry and thrift, and a highly skilled labour force with unmatched engineering capability in hi-tech manufacturing, remain intact. However, throughout the 1990s into 2000, domestic aggregate demand - both private investment and consumption - failed to recover.","","Japan; economic growth; Gross Domestic Product; national economy","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0035040655"

Additionally, we find that start-ups founded by these entrepreneurs display lower financial and innovative performance than start-ups founded by entrepreneurs who are relatively insensitive to business cycles.

Similarly, nonprofit organizations may accumulate operating reserves that allow them to smooth out annual imbalances between revenues and expenses, especially when facing a fiscal shock. Agency theory, on the other hand, indicates that managers might use these reserves to enrich themselves at the expense of the organization. This article is a step toward addressing a gap in our knowledge by analyzing the implications of reserves on nonprofit spending in general and also on particular functions (program versus overhead spending). Using a long panel of data from 1995 to 2011 and controlling for sample selection bias, the empirical results suggest that operating reserves held by nonprofit organizations do reduce expense gaps during downturns, but the effect is small. The results also suggest that nonprofit managers value current spending more than reserving funds for the future. Further, operating reserves are not associated with agency problems as predicted by theory. The empirical results suggest that the current rule of thumb—that nonprofits ought to hold up to 6 months of operating reserves—is inadequate if these pools of savings are intended to maintain all spending at trend during poor fiscal times. If, however, reserves are intended to only offset trend deviations partially while alternative strategies are sought, then the current rule of thumb may be sufficient. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","finance; principal-agent","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85033772974"

Design/methodology/approach: Based on prior empirical studies and by integrating the insights of different theories, this study proposes a framework linking CSR, firm default risk and corporate financial performance to explain firms' social behavior that can trigger default risk determinants (e.g. cost of capital, leverage, sales level) directly or indirectly. The authors use a panel regression approach. Findings: The results support the mitigating effect of CSR on firm default risk. This effect is higher during a financial crisis, suggesting that CSR could provide insurance-like protection during economic downturns. These results hold even after using an alternative risk measure. Granger causality test results strongly suggest that reverse causality is not a concern. An instrumental variable approach is proposed to deal with potential endogeneity issues. Originality/value: While other studies examine the CSR–firm default risk relationship in US samples, this study focuses on the Eurozone. The novelty of this work is based on its sample and how financial crises are addressed within this relationship.

Based on primary archival material, it explores how the census emerged from the connections between American and international institutions at a time when food security and the need to address problems of trade and competition appeared as central economic concerns of interstate relations. The article focuses on the role played by the American agricultural expert Leon Estabrook (1869-1937) and a related network of scientists and economists in the preparation and implementation of the statistical survey. By examining how Estabrook's vision of economic development and scientific planning was shaped by his national background and redefined by his transnational engagement, the article sheds light on the global dominance and limitations of American scientific knowledge and agricultural practices in the interwar years. It uncovers the political manoeuvrings and negotiations that were necessary to move forward with the project, and assesses the survey's outcome against the backdrop of the global economic downturn of the 1930s.

First, we map Minsky’s definitions of hedge, speculative and Ponzi finance onto firm-level data to describe the evolution of Minskian regimes. We highlight striking growth in the share of Ponzi firms in the post-1970 US, concentrated among small corporations. This secular growth in the incidence of Ponzi firms is consistent with the possibility of a long wave of increasingly fragile finance in the US economy. Second, we explore the possibility of short-run Minskian dynamics at a business cycle frequency. Using linear probability models relating firms’ probability of being Ponzi to the aggregate output gap, which captures short-term macroeconomic fluctuations exogenous to individual firms, we find that the relationship between aggregate downturns and the probability of being Ponzi is statistically significant, but very small (almost zero). This result is corroborated by quantile regressions using a continuous measure of financial fragility, the interest coverage ratio, which identify almost zero effects of short-term fluctuations on financial fragility across the interest coverage distribution. Together, these results speak to an important question in the theoretical literature on financial fragility regarding the duration of Minskian cycles, and lend support, in particular, to the contention that Minskian dynamics may take the form of long waves, but do not operate at business cycle frequencies. ©The Author(s) 2019.

The results show that carry trades are profitable in a regime with low exchange rate volatility, signifying the failure of uncovered interest rate parity (UIP). However, carry trades yield losses in a regime with high exchange rate volatility, which implies a reversion to UIP. The endogenous latent factor obtained from the model represents historical economic downturns associated with carry trade losses well.

First, we find that compositional differences in structural factors like occupational level and temporary employment contracts account for the major part of the difference in the job loss between immigrants and natives. Secondly, we find that during the Great Recession the likelihood of job loss is disproportionally higher among immigrants than natives.

The fifth wave (2010) of the European Social Survey was used and combined with macro-level data on labour market policies of the OECD. The sample consisted of 18,172 observations in 19 countries. Findings: The results show that higher levels of participation and spending on training policies are related to a smaller difference in the unemployment risks of the educational groups. Higher training policy intensity is associated with a lower unemployment risk for the lesser educated and a higher unemployment risk for the higher educated. This implies that the lesser educated are better able to withstand downward pressure from the higher educated, thereby, reducing downward displacement during an economic downturn. Hiring subsidies do not seem to be associated with the impact of education on unemployment. Originality/value: The paper adds to the discussion on ALMP training and hiring subsidies that are primarily rooted in the human capital theory and signalling theory. Both theories ignore the social context of labour market behaviour. The job competition theory and cumulative (dis)advantage theory add to these theories by focussing on the relative position of individuals and the characteristics that accompany the social position of the individual. © 2019, Luc Benda, Ferry Koster and Romke J. van der Veen.","Active labour market policy; Cumulative (dis)advantage; Displacement; Job competition; Matthew effect; Unemployment","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85060518190"

Overall, the Central Guarantee Fund generated an increase in the profitability of guaranteed firms during the period of economic downturn. However, significant differences emerged across firms by size and sector.

The financial crisis of 2008-2009 therefore sparked fears that foreign banks would remove their operations from their Central and East European markets because of a 'home bias' in lending. Such fears were predicated on the widely held beliefs that banks' loyalties lie with their home markets and that it is therefore desirable to protect domestic bank ownership to help combat an economic downturn.

From this vantage point, it considers the power of alternative approaches in explaining the resilience or breakdown of autocratic regimes in the face of exogenously inspired protests. These explanations centre on the destabilizing impact of sudden economic downturns, the varied resilience of authoritarian subtypes, linkages to the outside world, the advantages of resource wealth and the threats posed by leadership successions. Drawing a deliberate comparison between these two waves of contention reveals several findings: first, structural factors such as resource wealth, monarchical political organization and weak political links to the outside made autocrats more resilient in the face of regional protest waves. Second, regimes temporarily undergoing leadership transitions were more vulnerable amidst regional waves. © The Author(s).

This paper investigates the pattern of the unemployment persistence in the United States and other 28 OECD countries before and after the Great Recession. To detect possible changes in the pattern of unemployment persistence, we employ a mean bias-corrected estimation of the persistence parameter with a rolling window of five years. In addition, we estimate the most likely date of change in the trend function of unemployment to test whether there was any significant change in the pattern of unemployment persistence after the Great Recession. We find significant evidence of a structural break and hysteresis in unemployment rates, with a persistence parameter close to unity, across the United States and other 28 OECD countries. Besides, bootstrap permutation tests show that all half-lives and impulse response functions have significantly changed after the Great Recession. Therefore, our findings call for structural reforms aimed at improving labor market performance, to prevent upward shifts in unemployment across OECD countries from becoming permanent. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Half-lives; Structural breaks; Unemployment rate; Unit root tests","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85016459053"

Utopian Politics confronts a world intensely aware of the problems that we face and sadly lacking in solutions, positing a utopian articulation of citizenship focused on community participation at a grassroots level. By re-examining central concepts and thinkers in political theory, this book re-casts the concepts of utopia and citizenship both as part of the classical philosophical tradition and simultaneously as part of the cutting edge of radical alternatives. This book includes never-before published ethnographic research, interviews and photographs from a range of autonomous UK communities, to show how the boundaries of politics and citizenship can be questioned and proposes an innovative methodology inspired by classical and post-structural anarchism. By considering ideas and practices that are generally considered to be marginal to mainstream political theory and practice, the book encourages readers to think about longstanding and central political debates in an entirely new, and creative way.

Yet in the post-GFC policy environment urban infrastructure has recentred the role of infrastructure in driving urban economic recovery in terms of economic prosperity. Drawing from the state of exception literature, I call on the notion of urgency to explore infrastructure planning as it manifests at the juncture between strategic planning and implementation.

Faced with the prison population growth together with the economic downturn and budget crises, many states are seeking ways to break the increasing cycle of recidivism. Although research on recidivism and desistance has not always learned from each other, recently, there is an increasing convergence of these two streams of research. This convergence has been stimulated by a variety of factors, but most notably, it draws from emerging research on redemption, which focuses on the inverse relationship between recidivism risk and time since previous contact with the criminal justice system. Although the concepts of recidivism, desistance, and redemption are all about continuity and change in criminal offending over time, the relationship between the three has not been examined. In this paper, we discuss the interface between recidivism and desistance research with a particular focus on redemption research; point out one emerging consensus from both recidivism and desistance research, namely, the importance of offenders' motivation and individual internal change; and discuss new ideas to effectively improve our approaches of reducing recidivism and facilitating desistance. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84897421428"

Revenue shortfalls in states decreased intergovernmental transfers, which compounded the plight of local governments already facing large declines in own-source property taxes. Among the many casualties of this economic downturn were school districts, which responded by implementing a variety of financial management strategies to continue providing educational service provision to more than 50 million students across the United States. One strategy school districts continue to utilize is countercyclical stabilization of expenditures with fiscal slack, which raises an important—and, to date, largely unanswered—question of how school districts manage to accumulate fiscal slack, given both volatility and decreases in revenues in the years following the Great Recession. One approach is to use implicit slack from biased forecasts to generate explicit fiscal slack in the unassigned fund balance. This article provides evidence for this strategy by empirically testing it with data from Kentucky school districts from school years 2001-2002 to 2013-2014. The findings indicate that school districts are engaged in strategic planning with implicit fiscal slack, which allows them to accumulate explicit fiscal slack, a cornerstone of prudent financial management that can provide budgetary flexibility during financial uncertainty. The relationship between implicit and explicit fiscal slack is heterogeneous over the business cycle, providing further evidence of strategic planning. Practitioners can also use the findings of this article to support the strategic use of forecasts to help accumulate unassigned fund balance, particularly in the years after the Great Recession. © The Author(s) 2018.","budgeting; financial management; forecasting; strategic planning","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85059287071"

Design/methodology/approach: For the period 2008 to mid-2009, the author surveyed articles in mainstream media and business periodicals focusing on corporate social responsibility; reviewed polls for methodology and results; searched press releases for mention of corporate social responsibility; and interviewed professionals employed in the field. The author sought quantifiable examples of corporate financial support for programs in light of the recessionary economy. The author also looked to define today's corporate social responsibility as a philosophy reflecting the values of environmentalism, corporate transparency, community investment, diversity programs and other social benefits. Findings: CSR is a wide-ranging global movement advocating good corporate citizenship through such values as sustainability, corporate transparency, business ethics, workforce diversity, philanthropy, quality, service to community and workforce education. Even as corporations shed costs by the billions, CSR programs are thriving. The reasons are complex, but involve the conflation of CSR with environmentalism, and the apparent genuineness of corporate executives' commitment to its principles. Research limitations/implications: Research found fewer in-depth articles on the topic than might be expected, particularly articles providing or examining hard data. Practical implications: For those seeking to develop, sustain or evaluate a corporate social responsibility program, this article offers context, insight, and caution. Originality/value: The article suggests there is resilience to corporate social responsibility, in light of the durability it has shown in the current economic downturn. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Cause marketing; Citizenship; Corporate social responsibility; Economic cycles; Economic sustainability","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-78650210283"

This study examines various federal and state legislation events regarding casino gaming regulation and deregulation, and finds that the announcement effects on stock portfolio returns vary across different types of gaming companies. On average, gaming equipment suppliers and small casino operators are found to react to legislation events more significantly, compared with those large casino firms. Furthermore, since the casino gaming business is believed to be highly sensitive to the economic upturns and downturns, this paper also investigates the impacts on the risk-adjusted return (alpha) and the systematic risk (beta) of gaming stocks across ""bulla"" (up) and ""beara""(down) market situations. The results indicate that between July 1993 and December 1997, gaming stocks on average yield a significantly lower return and a significantly greater systematic risk against the US stock market. After changes in stock market conditions are controlled, the systematic risk is still considerably above the market average, but the excess return turns out insignificant. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.","Abnormal returns; Event studies; Gaming industry; Legislation event","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-33646226810"

Either is a very expensive mistake. A Bain & Company study has found that over the last 20 years, corporations that took a disciplined approach to divestiture created nearly twice as much value for shareholders as the average firm. In this article, Bain partners Mankins, Harding, and Weddigen set out the four straightforward rules those effective divestors follow. First: Just as they have acquisition teams, smart divestors have full-time divestiture groups, which continually screen their companies' portfolios for likely businesses to sell off and think through the timing and implementation steps needed to maximize value in each particular case. Second: They choose their divestiture candidates objectively. Too many firms rush to sell in economic downturns, when prices are low. Thoughtful divestors will sell only those businesses that do not fit with the corporation's core and are not worth more to themselves than they are to any other company. Third: Successful divestors consider how to structure a deal and to whom they will sell as carefully as they consider what units to sell and when. And they are as meticulous about planning the implementation of a deal as savvy acquirers are about postmerger integration. Fourth: They make a compelling case for how, and how quickly, the deal will benefit the buyer, and they make sure the selling unit's employees will be motivated to stay on and realize that value. Using these four rules, companies as diverse as Textron, Weyerhaeuser, Ford, Groupe Danone, and Roche have become ""divestiture ready"": consistently able to sell at the right time and in the right way to create the most value for their shareholders.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-53849138754"

The consensus view is that the poor become better off. But what happens to the poor during economic downturns triggered by financial crises? The conventional wisdom is that they not only become worse off but that they suffer disproportionately to the nonpoor. Is this actually the case?

Design/methodology/approachA database of chain hotels with a rating of three or more stars was used to estimate MANOVA and ANOVA models to analyse the role of RMSs in hotel performance. FindingsIn a context of strong competition in prices and surplus capacity, the findings suggest that RMSs have been more effective in improving occupancy than in achieving higher rates. Also, the use of RMSs did not have a significant impact on hotel labour productivity. Research limitations/implicationsManagers may believe that they have adopted an RMS when, in fact, they have not fully done so. In addition, establishment-level unobserved heterogeneity, such as the quality of management or unobserved quality of service, cannot be fully controlled because of the nature of the data used. The main implication of this paper is that the potential of RMSs as revenue enhancer might be influenced by unstable market and economic conditions. However, the absence of significant effects on RevPAR performance might be also the result of firms’ adopting inadequate RM strategies. Further research could investigate whether the findings are context-specific or whether firms are failing to implement effective RMSs for other reasons.

First, to examine the role of expectations in shaping agents' behaviour within an extended time frame which incorporates a prolonged harsh downturn of economic activity. Therefore, the authors allow for an indirect impact of economy-wide expectations operating via their coexistence with firms' balance sheet factors. Second, it is tested whether the behaviour of listed firms as regards to debt follows the pecking order theory. Design/methodology/approach: The authors use the panel data methodology in the estimation of the financial structure models since unobservable heterogeneity is an important determinant towards the target leverage. A fixed effects estimation procedure, with robust intercepts allowed to vary across firms, was employed to examine the relationship between leverage and performance. Findings: The findings offer evidence of patterns of pecking order behaviour and thus for the necessity of internal financing over external debt. The authors also extended the set of determinants by investigating the effect of macroeconomic conditions on the debt decision of firms. Contrary to the authors’ expectations, short-run beliefs of economic agents appear to play a negative role in leverage. Originality/value: This paper contributes to the literature in a number of ways. First, following the growing literature of loan dynamics, the findings provide useful insights into corporate capital structure decisions in an economy in which businesses were almost excluded from external financing for over a decade. Second, in order to better understand corporate financing decisions, it is necessary to consider the overall economic framework in which companies and especially the listed ones operate. © 2020, Petros Kalantonis, Christos Kallandranis and Marios Sotiropoulos.","Leverage; Panel data; Pecking order theory; Sentiment; Size","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138865529"

In 2018, the EU adopted a structural reform of its own ETS with the objective of increasing and stabilising carbon prices. This reform raises fundamental questions concerning the free market nature of the ETS and its function as a driver of low‐carbon investments. On the one hand, regulatory adjustments are necessary to address the large surplus of allowances that can result from exog-enous shocks (e.g. economic downturn). On the other hand, the risk of regulatory intervention in the market undermines investor certainty. In China, limited regulatory independence and more stringent government control over the market exacerbates the threat posed by price control measures to the integrity of China's ETS and its role as a driver of investments in environmental protection. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85063297011"

Econometrica, 57, 357–384] to analyse the influence of government policies, and the sample comprised 18 Taiwanese CCI stocks for the 2000–2014 period. The MSM decomposes policy-momentum cycles into two distinct states: high volatility and low volatility (HV and LV). The mean growth rate of the HV is 0.87% and the average growth rate of the LV is 10.37%. The state probability that will remain in the LV is 80%, and the state probability that will remain in the HV is 94%, meaning that the probability will shift from an HV (LV) to an LV (HV) is 6% (20%). The findings indicate that cultural creative industries in Taiwan have a high tendency to stay in the HV state and a low tendency to shift from an HV state to an LV state. Empirical results show that Taiwanese government policies were the main activator of development in Taiwan's CCIs and this development can continuously maintain a positive mean growth rate, even in the event of sudden economic downturns. © 2014, Taylor & Francis.","cultural creative industries; Markov-switching model; policy momentum","","Letter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84942191586"

It begins by explaining why research on how litigants assess procedures could be used to advance procedural justice and mitigate the negative impact that the economic downturn has had on the resolution of civil cases. It then presents analyses regarding: (1) how attractive litigants find various legal procedures (e.g., Negotiation, Mediation, Non-binding Arbitration, Binding Arbitration, Jury Trials, Judge Trials); (2) how they assess the relative probability that they will use each procedure; (3) how their attraction ratings and ""expected use"" estimates compare for each procedure; and (4) whether demographic, case type, relationship, and attitudinal factors predict their attraction to each procedure. The analyses revealed that litigants preferred Mediation, the Judge Trial, and Attorneys Negotiate with Clients Present to all other examined procedures. The lack of relations between attraction to procedures and many of the predictor variables (i.e., demographic, case type, relationship, and attitudinal factors) suggests that some factors previously associated with ex ante perceptions are not significant predictors when evaluated concurrently. The major findings are discussed in the context of dispute resolution systems design in courts, client counseling protocols, procedural justice, and the psychology of litigants more broadly.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84897713254"

Dominant parties, particularly in a developmental context (the primary setting for such regimes), and especially where elections are more than minimally meaningful, curry performance legitimacy and loyalty not just through skewed rules and coercion, but through material incentives: “money politics.” If challengers can find a way to de-emphasize support based on material inducements, they stand a chance of securing gains via elections, rather than relying on economic downturns to shrink patronage coffers. Drawing on extensive original ethnographic and survey data from electoral-authoritarian Malaysia, I explore campaign finance and distributions on both sides in the latest, most regime-threatening general election, which was held on May 5, 2013. Evidence suggests that it was by disentangling clientelist networks from the patronage they so often serve to disseminate, allowing a focus on more programmatic than particularistic appeals, that the opposition Pakatan Rakyat alliance so nearly bested the long-dominant Barisan Nasional regime. Persona – being known and seen among the electorate – still matters as much as before, but relies less consistently than in the past on targeted patronage as a premise for loyalty. © 2016 BCAS, Inc.","clientelism; electoral authoritarianism; Malaysia; money politics","Malaysia; authoritarianism; economic policy; election; electoral system; political economy; political system","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84959336834"

Paradoxically, the global economic downturn offers opportunities to innovate on policies to regenerate areas experiencing deindustrialisation, with one emerging focus being the development of 'green skills' to facilitate the transition of these places to 'green economies'. In this article, we explore similar policy objectives (i.e. regeneration activity based (in part) on green economy transitions) across three deindustrialising/deindustrialised regions - Appalachia (United States), Ruhr (Germany) and the Valleys (South Wales) - to provide an account of the ways in which different regions with similar industrial pasts diverge in their approach to moving towards greener futures. Our argument is that the emphasis in such transitions should be the creation of 'decent' jobs, with new economic activity and employment initiatives embracing a 'high road' (i.e. high skill/high pay/high quality) trajectory. Utilising a 'varieties of capitalism' analysis, we contend that an effective, socially inclusive and 'high road' transition is more likely to emerge within co-ordinated market economy contexts, for example, Germany, than within the liberal market economy contexts of, for example, the United States and United Kingdom. In identifying the critical success factors leading to 'high road' green economy, the implications for any such transition within the liberal market economy context of Australia are highlighted. © The Author(s) 2013.","Green skills; labour; regeneration; region; transition","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84897663464"

Today consumers are more price sensitive and less brand loyal than ever before. Economic crises brought hard times into various markets; consumers buy according to special offers and do not notice brands' advantages and their message to them. Main market players have started price wars, which weakens brands and their positions in the market. Different markets require different marketing actions to achieve goals, although price wars are not a solution during economic downturn, especially for well-known and established brands. Marketing strategy, branding and appropriate actions, should be strong, but reach every consumer, especially those with reduced amount of revenue. This paper analyses factors which influence brands' growth. It also tries to understand, what drives consumers to buy appropriate brand. What could be done today, when brands face challenging times (great examples, how companies faced price wars). Also analyses strong brands performance during hard times (in our case, Kellogg's). © CSR, 2008-2009.","Branding strategy; Brands; Bubble theory; Case studies; Consumer economics; Economic crisis","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84888984438"

Five major explanations are tested to explain the gap, as well as understand the relative contribution of each explanation. Design/methodology/approach – Data were collected from 452 post-secondary students from Canada. Findings – Young women had lower initial and peak salary expectations than their male counterparts. The gap in peak salary could be explained by initial salary expectations, beta values, the interaction between beta values and gender, and estimations of the value of the labor market. Men and women in this study expected to earn a considerably larger peak salary than they expected for others. Research limitations/implications – Cross-sectional data cannot infer causality, and the Canadian sample may not be generalizable to other countries given that an economic downturn occurred at time of data collection. Research should continue to investigate how individuals establish initial salary expectations, while also testing more dynamic models given the interaction effect found in terms of gender and work values in explaining salary expectations. Practical implications – The majority of the gender gap in peak salary expectations can be explained by what men and women expect to earn immediately after graduation. Further, women and men have different perceptions of the value they attribute to the labor market and what might be a fair wage, especially when considering beta work values. Social implications – The data suggests that the gender-wage gap is likely to continue and that both young men and women would benefit from greater education and information with respect to the labor market and what they can reasonably expect to earn, not just initially, but from a long-term perspective. Originality/value – This study is the first to simultaneously investigate five theoretical explanations for the gender gap in pre-career expectations. © 2014 Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Career development; Gender; Salary expectations; Wage gap","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84926377703"

The development initiative acquired epochal significance at the intersection of three world-historical processes: The transition in the regulation of economic activity from laissez-faire to nationally managed economies; the dismantling of colonial empires and the emergence of a Third World; and the shift in the locus of hegemony from Britain to the USA, and the parallel cold war bifurcation of the world order. The promise and optimism generated by development was unevenly sustained during the long postwar boom, although the subsequent downturn altered many of the co-ordinates within which development was conceived, but outside which it could not survive. In this context, neoliberal globalisation has emerged as a new, albeit tenuous, framework for articulating global hierarchies. By historicising the development framework, and its links to the making and unmaking of the Third World, this article provides one plausible vantage point from which to survey the current dynamics between power and plenty.","","core-periphery relations; globalization; neoliberalism; new world order","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-33746442419"

Looking across four key indicators, we find that child poverty rates were higher amongst young carers than other children based on 3 years pooled data for 2013/14–2015/16. The differences in the prevalence of child poverty amongst young carers and other children are statistically significant in relation to two indicators (anchored low income before housing costs, and a combined measure of low income and material deprivation). Young carers also appear to have fared worse than other children in terms of trends in child poverty outcomes over the period that coincided with the financial crisis, economic downturn and onset of austerity. Amongst young carers, there was a statistically significant increase in relative low income after housing costs of nine percentage points (from 24 to 33%) between 2005/07 and 2013/15. This compares with a two percentage point decline amongst other children. Multivariate findings confirm that trends in child poverty outcomes amongst young carers were highly differentiated from those of other children and that the association between child poverty and young caring status strengthened over the period under observation. Multivariate analysis further suggests that the increases in child poverty rates amongst young carers were not driven by purely “compositional” factors relating to demographic characteristics of the households in which young carers live and that labour market factors are particularly important in explaining the trends that are observed. Overall, the findings from the study raise concerns that young carers were disproportionately impacted by the patterns of stagnating real income and declining income from employment that characterized the period following the financial crisis, economic downturn and onset of austerity, whilst underlining the importance of housing costs as a factor in child poverty amongst young carers, and raising important questions regarding the ongoing effectiveness of social protection for this group. © 2019, The Author(s).","Austerity; Child poverty; Financial crisis; Recession; Young carers","article; care behavior; case report; child; clinical article; employment; female; household; housing; human; job market; lowest income group; male; poverty; prevalence","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85071956693"

Despite calls for increased domestic consumption, opinion remains divided as to the extent to which policy-makers will make a genuine departure with China's export-orientation. This paper argues, however, that the direction of the Chinese political economy will depend much on the transformative role of workers’ struggles. Placed in a broader north-east Asian comparative perspective, we argue that China appears to be on the verge of a transition towards a limited labour supply, as evidenced in increasing labour shortages, rising wages costs and new forms of labour unrest. An in-depth case study of the strike at Nanhai Honda in 2010 suggests that China's migrant workers are beginning to develop a class consciousness and move from reactive to proactive demands. Furthermore, the response of the Chinese state and employers has shifted from one of outright repression to one of accommodation. These trends are likely to be highly significant in terms of China's uneven integration into the global economy. © 2014, © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","China; domestic consumption; labour; Nanhai Honda; strikes","China; economic integration; global economy; labor supply; migrant worker; political economy; wage","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84930046346"

This book furthers understanding about how this movement is organized, the role of ports acting as gateways and the actions of corridor players. A key question that confronts the shipping and port industries, as well as public authorities, is how to increase the benefits of maritime trade to the companies and institutions directly involved as well as the port city-regions where the transfers take place? This question is being posed in the midst of a global economic recession and trade downturn, and in the context of contemporary policy frameworks whose goals are to generate economic benefits and efficiencies rather than to maximize traffic volumes.

Two intersecting livelihood shocks—rapid food price inflation and the global economic downturn—affected virtually all South Africans in 2008. The 2008 General Household Survey shows a rise in household experiences of hunger in the order of 2–3 percentage points—and female-headed households suffered more than male-headed households. In the first year of the crises, female-headed households substantially raised the amount of money spend on food and the share of food expenditure in their total spending basket dramatically increased. This suggests that households were switching larger portions of their total household spending towards food—signalling a coping strategy to counter a severe livelihood shock. Women-headed households in traditional huts in predominantly rural provinces of Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal experienced the sharpest rise in hunger. Even households dependent on salaries and wages reported increasing experiences of moderate hunger. The policy implication is that gender-based targeting in food security policies must incorporate these additional determinants if they are to effectively address transitory food insecurity induced by similar livelihood shocks. © 2010, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","economic crisis; food price inflation; food spending; household hunger; location; women","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84876536787"

However, such cruises have frequently visited the Antarctic since the early 1990 s and even earlier in the Arctic, such as the first expedition in 1984 to the territory of Nunavut in the Canadian Arctic. This paper will examine some of the issues and implications that cruise tourism has for protected areas (particularly national parks) that are accessible to expedition cruises throughout the Canadian Arctic. Protected areas contribute to creating a sustainable industry through both their conservation of the landscape, but also in acting as a key attraction and thus economic driver for nearby communities. However, protected areas also rely on a sustainable tourism industry. This paper will utilize empirical data from two studies (2007 and 2009) that examined cruise visitors to Auyuittuq, Sirmilik and Quttinirpaaq National Parks in Nunavut and Torngat Mountains National Park in Nunatsiavut (Northern Labrador), and visitor management of such. In addition, first hand personal experience and knowledge from professional colleagues will be used to underpin survey results. Socio-economic changes, such as the downturn in the global economy effecting demand, occurring in line with environmental changes, such as climate change have significant effects on the Arctic landscape and wildlife. Thus, many levels of government management for these protected areas need to make changes in order to adapt. Cruise tourism in this region is globally connected to other regions and examination of this will also occur.","Canadian Arctic; Change; Expedition cruise ships; Protected areas; Sustainability","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84862058219"

For forty years, there has been a near consensus among employee advocates and worklaw scholars that the current doctrine of employment at will should be abandoned in favor of a rule requiring just cause for termination. This Article contends that such calls are misguided, not-as defenders of the current regime have argued-because a just cause rule grants workers too much protection vis-à-vis management, but because it grants them too little. A just cause rule provides only a weak cause of action to a narrow subset of workers : those able to prove they were fired for purely arbitrary reasons. It fails to account for the justifiable, but still devastating, termination of workers for economic reasons, by far the most common reason for job loss today. In this way, a just cause rule is not only inadequate, but also anachronistic. Just cause protection is consistent with a mid-twentieth-century view of the social contract of employment, one that anticipates a long-term, symbiotic relationship between employer and employee in an economy dependent on internal labor markets. Under such a system , a just cause rule gives legal force to parties' mutual and implicit understanding of their obligations to one another. In contrast, today's employers operate principally in an external labor market in which implicit promises of long-term employment have been replaced by implicit promises of long-term employability. Companies and workers alike anticipate significant job turnover both in times of economic turbulence, such as the recent downturn, in which employers were forced to shed numerous workers due to financial hardship, as well as during economic bubbles, in which companies lay off workers and reorganize for strategic reasons. Given these practices and expectations, the goal of termination law should not be protecting individual jobs but assisting workers in the inevitable situation of job loss. To that end, this Article proposes the adoption of a universal ""pay-or-play"" system of employment termination. Absent serious misconduct, employers would be required to provide advance notice of termination or offer wages and benefits for the duration of the notice period. In contrast to just cause proposals, ""pay-or-play"" recognizes the necessity and inevitability of employment termination. Rather than encourage parties to maintain status quo relationships, ""pay-or-play"" facilitates transition. It affirms managerial discretion to hire and fIre by eliminating fact-intensive inquiries into the reason for termination.

Knowing the risk and return associated with hospitality investment and the risk-adjusted performance of hospitality stock portfolio in the capital market is of critical importance to hospitality investors. This study compares the risk-adjusted stock performances of three hospitality sectors (hotel/ motel, restaurant, and casino/gaming) as three portfolios during the most recent economic downturn (2000-2003). Four portfolio performance indexes- Treynor ratio, Sharpe ratio, Jensen ratio, and Appraisal ratio-were estimated to measure their risk-adjusted performances. The results show that the casino/gaming sector performed the best, followed by the restaurant sector. The hotel/motel sector was the weakest performer among the three, mainly due to its higher risks. Our analysis suggests that the hotel/motel sector may improve its market performance via prudent growth and less reliance on debt financing. © Copyright (c) by The Haworth Press, Inc.

Due to locational disadvantages, especially being situated at the tip of the funnel-shaped Bay of Bengal on the south and at the foot of Himalayas on the north, every year it experiences a number of different types of natural calamities, such as flood, cyclone, river bank erosion, drought etc. As a result of climate change events, an increasing trend in frequency has been observed in recent time. Spatial distribution of natural calamities portraits northern part as prone to flood, western part to drought, eastern part (basically hilly region) to flash flood and southern part to cyclone. The Southern part, especially the coastal belt of the country is the worst affected area to cyclones and their ultimate effects. Among these cyclones, Aila was a severe one that tore through the area in 2009 affecting the livelihood of the inhabitants. This study is an effort to discuss the inhabitants’ vulnerability and their adaptation strategies to economic changes caused by Aila, such as occupation, income, expenditure capacity, savings, housing structures, general and agricultural land use etc. For the study required data has been collected from both primary and secondary sources. Primary data have been collected through questionnaire survey and group discussion while secondary data, especially satellite images have been collected from Google Earth. Then different softwares like SPSS have been used for analysis and graphic presentation of the collected primary data, and ERDAS IMAGINE and ArcGIS have been used for mapping analysis and presentation. The research findings indicate that because of the cyclone Aila, economy of the area has taken downturn. Most of the people were engaged in agriculture allied activities, but after Aila, agricultural land had been converted into aquaculture. Consequently, people have switched to occupations with lesser earnings, such as daily labour, rickshaw puller, brick field worker etc. As a result, people had to reduce all sorts of daily consumptions to cope up with the changing situation. The Governmental Organisations and the Non-Governmental Organisations extended little help to rebuild houses, embankment, road, reforestation etc. but not towards any income generates activities. So, the livelihood of the people is still vulnerable in terms of economy, and attention of the responsible authorities needs to be drawn to create income generating activities to recover the vulnerable situation in the study area. © 2022, The Author(s).","Adaptation; Cyclone Aila; Economic transformation; Land use change; Vulnerability","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85125545009"

The focus of our analyses is on the pattern of life, job and health satisfaction over time and the influence of unemployment rates, inflation rates and GDP growth. We compare the UK and Germany, two countries with different employment protection regulations and different consequences of the crisis for the labour market.

This paper explores what types of localities were most resilient to the 2008 economic recession due to their socio-economic structure. Resilience was defined on the basis of a business cycle as the recovery to pre-recession value and is measured with the change in gross value added per employee by municipality in Slovenia (LAU 2), and the change in the registered unemployment rate. Descriptive statistics were used to determine the most resilient Slovenian municipalities’ socio-economic structure before the recession. It was found out that specialization, export and transport infrastructure had the greatest influence on local resilience, while economic development and social structure partly influenced it. This paper adds to the discussion of the vagueness of the concept of resilience by clarifying its definition and measurement. Findings about socio-economic structure’s influence on resilience are important for academics as well as practitioners who contribute to municipality’s ability to avoid or mitigate a future recession. © 2018 The Author(s).","Economic downturn; Economic recession; Municipality; Regional planning; Resilience; Resistance; Slovenia; Socio-economic structure","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85059989166"

The market liberalization of the financial services industry has been at the hub of reforms. During the 1980s, changes in the regulation of the British financial sector transformed it from a set of self-contained markets to an integrated financial system. The southern bias to this growth has been laid, in part, at the door of the concentration of the financial sector close to the capital and the impact of the government's supply side reforms on consumer demand in the more prosperous regions. The recession in the 1990s has in many ways witnessed a reversal of these trends with the downturn in the financial sector in the south leaving northern regions relatively unscathed. This article seeks to illustrate these issues. One of the key outcomes of the period of liberalization of the financial sector has been the amplification of the regional economic cycle and volatility in regional disparities. These significant shifts in regional prosperity have had an important impact on the national economic trajectory. -from Authors","","UK; economic prosperity; financial service; industrial deregulation; market liberalisation; regional prosperity","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0027037917"

Therefore, we use a time-varying rolling-window approach to identify how CL affects the consumer confidence index (CCI). We find that CL can be seen as vital support for promoting confidence because it can ease liquidity constraints and improve consumption levels. The empirical outcome is supported by the Rational Expectations Perpetual Income Hypothesis (RE-PIH), emphasizing that increasing CL can boost consumer confidence. Conversely, CCI has both positive and negative effects on CL. The positive effects suggest that consumers’ optimistic confidence leads them to increase borrowing, which in turn creates a heavier debt burden. This statement cannot be supported by the negative effect due to consumers’ blind self-confidence will cause cognitive bias, which is not conducive to the loan market development. Against the backdrop of increased global uncertainty due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the government’s continuous adjustment of loan policies, consumers can effectively optimise their consumption decision-making through borrowing. The policymaker can maintain loan stability by effectively promoting consumer confidence and raising the consumption level of the whole society. © 2022 The Author(s).

What did we underestimate the importance of? What do we need to think more about? One conclusion is that public finance economists need to better integrate the economic analysis of taxation with the concerns and expertise of macroeconomists, finance economists, and accountants.

The history of long‐wave studies and controversy is discussed. The original findings of N. D. Kondratiev are briefly reviewed. The characteristics of the present downturn are discussed. A systems summary of the Kondratiev phenomenon is presented. Then evidence for the existence of the Kondratiev phenomenon and its associated manifestations is provided. Considerable evidence comes from the analysis of time‐series data. However, major emphasis is placed on systems theory and the explanatory role of system dynamics, catastrophe theory and dissipative‐structure theory. The importance of macropsychological driving forces is briefly summarized. Kondratiev theory is interpreted as paradigm shift. The relevance of Kondratiev theory to societal systems planning, policymaking and design is stressed.

Therefore, an objective necessity arises for a more detailed study of the money laundering within the scope of its developmental patterns and time-dependent behaviour. The study mission is the development of a theoretical framework and methodological support for modelling the cyclic component of the money laundering risk. The correlation and regression are used for isolating the cyclic component. In turn, the Fourier harmonic analysis allows specifying the cyclic component. Additionally, we carried out a decomposition of time series, analysis of its volatility and persistence using the Hurst exponent. We determined the peaks, downturns and duration of the money laundering cycles in the developed economies and economies in transition, and established the possibility of predicting this process in the medium term. We proved the internationalization of the money laundering and the similarity of behaviour of trends that characterize it both for developed economies among themselves and between groups of countries. The further scientific research is needed within the framework of the imposition of trends in the development of the money laundering processes of some countries on others and the formation of international medium-term anti-fraud strategies. © 2019 The Authors.","Anti money laundering; Cyclic component; Fourier analysis; Money laundering risk; Persistence; Time series analysis; Trend analysis; Volatility","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85076931507"

However, all retailers are not equally affected by recessionary periods, with some viewing this time as an opportunity to invest and establish competitive advantage and others cutting back and waiting for the recession to pass. In the light of the current economic downturn, the purpose of this paper is to investigate retailers' strategic response to the downturn, and assess how these responses differ across different organisations in terms of size, geographic location, and sector of operation. Design/methodology/approach – A total of 50 (25 Australian, 25 New Zealand) managers associated with the retail sector (ranging from chief executive officers to store owners) were invited to participate in facetoface interviews, resulting in 28 indepth interviews (15 Australian, 13 New Zealand) across a wide range of retail categories. These exploratory data were combined with a review of the literature to explore retailer responses to the current economic downturn. Findings – This paper suggests that there are growth opportunities for retailers during times of economic downturn. Specifically, this paper suggests that large retailers see this as an opportunity to invest in green and sustainable business practices as a means to aid in the recovery of the recession in terms of reducing costs and beyond in terms of developing competitive advantage. Other strategies include: personalised offerings, differentiation via service, realignment of offer to changing consumer value(s), and reduced costs and investment. Research limitations/implications – The focus of this paper is medium to large sized organisations and, as such, its generalisability to small retailers may be somewhat limited. Originality/value – Past research reveals that not all the retailers are equally affected by recessionary periods. Given this, the value of this paper lies in providing insight into strategic response to an economic downturn, and providing a foundation for examining these strategies and their link to retail performance via quantitative research. © 2010, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Australia; New Zealand; Recession; Retailing; Strategic planning","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-77953974406"

We study the relationship between household student loan burden and the likelihood of financial stress during the Great Recession using the unique 2007 to 2009 panel of the Survey of Consumer Finances. We find a robust positive relationship across four dimensions of student loan burden and holding constant household characteristics and previous financial stress. We find that Black and Hispanic households with higher student debt burdens experienced higher odds of financial stress relative to White households, even once accounting for prior financial stress.

In The Success of the Left in Latin America: Untainted Parties, Market Reforms, and Voting Behavior, Rosario Queirolo argues that the “pink tide” that swept across Latin America beginning in the late 1990s-with the election of a growing number of leftist political candidates to public office-was caused by the intent of voters to punish political parties unable to improve the economic well-being of their electorates. She argues that Latin Americans vote based on performance, ousting those whom they perceive as responsible for economic downturns, and ushering into power those in the “untainted opposition,” which has been the Left in most Latin American countries. Queirolo argues that the effects of neoliberal economic reforms did not produce more votes for political parties on the Left. Rather, the key variable is unemployment. Left-leaning parties in Latin America increase their electoral chances when unemployment is high. In addition to explaining recent electoral successes of leftist parties, The Success of the Left in Latin America also undermines a dominant scholarly view of Latin Americans as random and unpredictable voters by showing how the electorate at the polls holds politicians accountable. © 2013 by University of Notre Dame.","","","Book","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84945347172"

This relationship arises due to direct economic benefits of cash savings from tax avoidance. On one hand, cash savings from tax avoidance may prompt managers to retain excess resources when activity goes down. On the other hand, tax avoidance may alleviate managers’ concerns about adjustment costs due to cost reductions in sales downturns. Using a large sample spanning the 1993-2013 period, we document a significantly negative relationship between tax avoidance, proxied by cash effective tax rate, and asymmetric cost behavior. The result suggests that asymmetric cost behavior is less pronounced when tax avoidance is higher. We further find that this relationship varies with firms’ business strategies, cash flow volatility, and tax fees paid to the auditor.

Using the business cycle accounting framework of Chari, Kehoe and McGrattan (2005), we examine the factors that led to the depression and the subsequent recovery in the 1990s. We calculate efficiency, labour, investment and government wedges and evaluate the contribution of each to the downturn and subsequent recovery. We find that the efficiency wedge on its own can account for a significant portion of the downturn, but predicts a stronger recovery in output than occurred. The labour wedge also helps account for what happened during the depression episode. We also find that the investment wedge played no role in the depression.","","Eurasia; Europe; Ireland; Western Europe; economic history; factor analysis; Great Depression","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-33749005646"

Moreover we have witnessed large shifts in the locations of immigrants and their families between and within the metropolitan areas of the United States. Charlotte, North Carolina, may be a more active and dynamic immigrant destination than Chicago, Illinois, while the suburbs are receiving ever more immigrants. The work of John Mollenkopf, Manuel Pastor, and their colleagues represents one of the first systematic comparative studies of immigrant incorporation at the metropolitan level. They consider immigrant reception in seven different metro areas, and their analyses stress the differences in capacity and response between central cities, down-at-the-heels suburbs, and outer metropolitan areas, as well as across metro areas. A key feature of case studies in the book is their inclusion of not only traditional receiving areas (New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles) but also newer ones (Charlotte, Phoenix, San Jose, and California’s ""Inland Empire""). Another innovative aspect is that the authors link their work to the new literature on regional governance, contribute to emerging research on spatial variations within metropolitan areas, and highlight points of intersection with the longer-term processes of immigrant integration. © 2016 by Cornell University.","","","Book","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85011769657"

As the fiscal crash of 2007/8 turned into the Great Recession and tax revenues tumbled, public finances across the UK, the USA and Europe plunged into deficit. Controversial attempts by governments to balance their budgets, commonly described as austerity by critics, had mixed success, politically and economically. Michael Burton outlines how politicians tackled the worst economic downturn in over half a century, drawing on previous examples of deficit-reduction to see how governments managed public finances in recessions and where austerity worked and where it failed. This two-part book, which for the first time provides an historical context to austerity, analyses firstly deficit-reduction in the UK in the 1970s, 1980s, 1990s and 2010-2016, and then looks at case studies in Europe, the USA, Canada and Asia Pacific. The author concludes that with the ageing population placing greater pressure through health and pensions on the public finances of the developed world, politicians and their electorates will have to learn to live long-term with austerity. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s) 2016.","","","Book","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85008945747"

Globally in 2011, 205 million people were unemployed — the highest number since records began. As a result of the crises, at least 55,000 more children are likely to die each year from 2009 to 2015. The prevalence of children dropping out of school has increased, as boys have been propelled into the workforce and girls given an increased burden of household tasks. By 2009, at least 100 million more people were hungry and undernourished, a situation that continues to deteriorate owing to escalating food prices. This chapter argues that the effects of the crises themselves are being compounded rather than relieved by the measures that many governments are taking in response. These are seriously threatening the lives and livelihoods of millions of the poorest people, and are having a devastating effect on their enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights (ESCR). While the human rights framework does not prohibit austerity measures per se, in many instances these have had grave consequences for the enjoyment of human rights, particularly for those living in poverty. © Cambridge University Press 2014.","","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84953713197"

In contrast, we find value increases for firms refocusing during the 1990s and for firms divesting loss-making assets. Returning the proceeds from the sale to shareholders or reducing leverage were also associated with value increases, whereas reinvesting the proceeds for growth had a negative impact during the 1980s, which disappeared in the 1990s, possibly as a result of the disciplinary role of the economic downturn on the investment behaviour of firms. © 2001 Blackwell Publishers Ltd.","Agency costs; Corporate restructuring; Refocusing; Sell-offs","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-34247857093"

In particular, they typically have a narrow resource base and a fragile and often vulnerable natural environment. While there is some research on islands and small states, there is a dearth of information on the South Pacific and very little research is being undertaken in the region compared to other geographical regions in the world. This volume brings together current work in Pacific Island tourism. In this collection, three main themes arise: Images of the South Pacific; Socio-economic Impacts of Tourism; and Pacific Island Countries and the Outside World. The first focus is on the question of image, namely, stereotypes of a destination held by tourists and potential tourists, the extent to which residents, for their part, really welcome visitors, and the role tourism might play in changing pre-established images. The second theme is tourism's impacts, notably the economic and socio-cultural effects of international tourism's intrusion in the region which, though often hotly debated, have attracted relatively little empirical research. The third focus is on the challenges of how PICs articulate with their external geo-political and physical environment. These involve existing relations with formal colonial centres, geographical isolation, the need for greater air access to the outside world and for more tourists, and the continuing threat to several PICs of global warming, which increased air travel will inevitably exacerbate. This text will be of interest to tourism students, researchers and academics in the fields of tourism, development studies and cultural studies. © 2015 Editorial matter and selection: Stephen Pratt and David Harrison; individual chapters: the contributors.

This is why participation in spatial planning has become a classic research question of many urban planning-related sciences. The greatest focus has been on cases of participation that present some kind of reaction to plans or actions, whereas far less attention has been given to cases of participation based on initiatives and the search for new content for underused or decaying areas. Such cases usually start with initiatives for the new use of particular places and often result in physical changes to these places. This article defines various types of local initiatives, and it especially studies the distinction between reactionary and contributive local initiatives and relates them to the notion of community. The article is based on an analysis of two particular cases. The differences in these two cases represent a foundation for the article's conclusions, which emphasises the potentials for stimulating contributive participation. The conclusion includes recommendations for the spatial planning system to become more open to participation in terms of revitalising underused spaces because such space has been increasing during the economic downturn. The complex and inefficient system of spatial planning is turning away many creative initiatives.","Community; Local initiatives; Participation; Urban regeneration","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84902436675"

To solve the problem, first, the consensus of a selected business cycle surveys indicator and the performance of the mechanical engineering industry were evaluated, and then, the results were put into the context of the time period and tested with nonparametric ANOVA. The results show that the selected indicator was more reliable in periods of growth and less reliable in downturns, which is a signal for SMEs as to how to interpret the business cycle surveys.

Design/methodology/approach: The analysis relies on a case study and uses qualitative and quantitative data obtained via interviews, employee survey and analysis of documents. The paper focuses on Ecoprint Ltd, a small printing house in Estonia, and analyzes its reactions to the economic downturn in 2008 and 2009 in terms of CSR. The authors then analyze the concurrence of these changes with its OC, based on a survey that relies on the Competing Values Framework. Findings: The dominant type of OC in the organization did not predict all its CSR practices, but described rather well how adaptation in the sphere of CSR took place as a result of economic downturn. The case demonstrated that CSR activities that relate to dominant OC types are less likely to be reduced in a recession; moreover, some were even intensified. On the other hand, there were certain CSR activities that reflected less prevalent types of OC, nevertheless these were not withdrawn either. Research limitations/implications: The method used, single case study, serves as an exploratory study. The relationship between unchanged CSR activities related to less dominant OC types is not easy to interpret and needs further investigation. Originality/value: There is abundant literature referring to a connection between OC and CSR, but related empirical research is hard to find. The current paper empirically explores the relationship between these concepts under the extraordinary economic situation that existed in Estonia in 2008-2009. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Competing values framework; Corporate social responsibility; Economic downturn; Estonia; National economy; Organizational culture","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84859407458"

Coupled with unprecedented budgetary austerity and rapidly ageing populations, 'stagnating' and 'shrinking' cities have emerged as a key challenge for policy and practice for decades to come. Local actors need to find new ways of collaborating across sectors, agencies and disciplines to unlock opportunities for interventions that mitigate the worst effects of urban shrinkage and long-term decline. Future Directions for the European Shrinking City focuses on policy and planning interventions that can be taken by municipalities and their local stakeholders to tackle stagnation and decline. With case studies from a range of European countries this book proposes ways to tackle shrinkage through governance, policy, planning, social, economic and management interventions.

This study highlights how economic crises create a space for new poverty discourses to emerge that challenge the hegemonic narrative, which stigmatizes and Otherizes people in poverty. However, representations of poverty remain racialized and gendered, as the “new poor” are portrayed as fundamentally different and more deserving of policy action than those who were in poverty prior to the Great Recession. © 2013 Policy Studies Organization.","crisis; Great Recession; poverty; poverty knowledge","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84896371625"

The primary objective is to examine the effects of the recent economic recession in Ireland on these expenditures. This study is the first to analyse Irish household sport expenditure data and the first to study the effects of the economic recession on these items. Research methods: Data from the 2004/2005 and 2009/2010 Irish Household Budget Surveys, a period which covers the economic recession in Ireland, are employed. A Tobit model is estimated as each of the four sports expenditures has a large amount of zero expenditures. Results and findings: The social and economic characteristics of Irish households affect each sports item in differing ways. The presence of children of a particular age appears to be a strong determinant of spending on categories of sports which involve more physical activity (sport participation and leisure fees). Other categories of sports are influenced more by income (attendance at sporting events) and age and social status (club subscriptions). For some categories of sport spending there is a strong link with how the economy is performing, whereas for others household characteristics play just as important a role. Implications: This research has shown that sport is a multi-faceted product. Its determinants and how it is affected by economic downturns depends on the type of expenditure examined. For spending on certain categories the recession has had a clear negative effect, whereas for others it has been neutral. These are important considerations for sports managers and policy-makers when devising their strategies. © 2015 European Association for Sport Management.","economic recession; expenditure elasticities; household sports expenditures; Tobit model","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84955181983"

Some of these fears are fueled by fear-related news as a form of sensational media coverage. As research on the variety of fears depicted in the news is scarce, this study analyzes the construction of fear-related news in the US and the UK from 1990 to 2017. By combining unsupervised machine learning in the form of topic modeling (N = 15,487) and manual content analysis (N = 1013), it explores the prevalence of themes and topics. It also analyzes the fear-inducing presentation of news through the use of fear appeals, specifically which (severe) threats are emphasized by the media. Results indicate that the media do not only concentrate on fears of violence and crime, but also on fears of economic downturn, political unrest, or social fears concerning unemployment. The most prominent threat emphasized across topics is death, followed by political and economic threats. Topic prevalence is highly volatile and coverage has not become more fear-inducing over time. Overall, this study contributes to a better understanding of how news media may foster fear: through mirroring a variety of economic, political and social fears and emphasizing specific threats across them. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","automated content analysis; crisis; fear; longitudinal analysis; News; sensationalism","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85083672854"

Given the nature of tourism services, a reduction in habitual consumption is highly probable during an economic crisis. Since the unemployment rate is strongly correlated with the economic cycle, the hypothesis that is discussed concerns whether residents’ decision to participate in tourism is affected by their region's level of unemployment. More specifically, it is suggested that unemployment not only affects the tourism participation decision of those who are out-of-work, but that aggregate unemployment (measured as the region's unemployment rate) also has a bearing on such decisions made by individuals in general. The results that were obtained for a set of EU countries show that the unemployment level has a positive effect on the probability of not going on holidays. This effect emerges when there is an unemployment rate of over 10%. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","decision to travel; EU countries; Great Recession; Regional unemployment; tourism participation","Europe; economic conditions; economic cycle; European Union; tourism; unemployment","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85045478604"

Given these shifting dynamics, boomers are likely to look to media portrayals of retirement and retirees- that is, to societal discourse-as one source of guidance. Although discourses do not specifically prescribe how individuals will act as retirees, they do provide messages that shape and constrain possibilities. This study draws upon thematic analysis of 100 articles from four high-circulation American publications (The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, USA Today, and AARP The Magazine/Bulletin) to identify three broad themes (each with sub-themes) in popular discursive representations of retirement: (a) financing retirement, (b) charting a ""new"" retirement course, and (c) staying active in retirement. Ultimately, results provide insight into dominant ideas about the ""ideal"" babyboomer retiree, which may represent contradictory or even impossible expectations for many retiring boomers. © The Author(s) 2018.

In turn, this reflects a move towards more demand-based innovation policy to tackle the grand challenges being faced by societies all over the globe (OECD, 2011; Izsak and Edler, 2011). While the economic downturn and the focus on efficiency gains in public expenditure have changed the nature of the debate somewhat, the OECD-wide trend in policy development continues in this direction. It is manifested in specific schemes to push procurement for innovation, and in attempts to improve procurement capabilities and regulations more generally. However, despite a high level of political intent, there is still a general perception that public procurement has not realized, by far, its potential as an engine for innovation. On the surface, the political climate changed during the economic crisis, and recent years have seen a turn towards more austere public budgets, and with it a shift of the debate on public spending from long-term societal benefit and innovation to reducing costs and securing national supplier benefits. Below that surface there is a range of more basic institutional and procedural reasons for slow progress. Case studies and qualitative analyses cast some light on the range of these reasons.

Design/methodology/approach: The paper uses a four-step process to develop, present and test (for predictive validity) a scale of strategic organizational resilience for frequent events or those needing long-term responses. Findings: The resulting seven-factor measurement scale of organizational resilience consists of readiness, slack, problem-solving, flexibility, connectedness, adaptiveness and proactiveness. Originality/value: The literature on organizational resilience explains how organizations recover from rare but catastrophic events by focusing on adaptation principles and short-term survival. The broader conceptualization presented here enables the study of organizational resilience in small-medium size enterprises (SMEs) across more frequent and pervasive events, such as financial crises, industry downturns and other forms of structural change and technological disruption. This is operationalized in a measure that includes new strategic factors associated with forward-planning and more traditional operationally focused elements. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Innovation; Proactiveness; Resilience; Strategy","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85161509768"

However, this kind of urbanization has changed irreversibly the traditional rural landscape around cities, leading to a new definition of 'rurality'. The present work discusses the intimate relationship between urban sprawl and new forms of rurality. Considering economic downturns and the possible impact on landscape transformations, our study focuses on a representative Mediterranean case of urban sprawl (the metropolitan region of Athens, Greece). In this area, urban settlements expanded rapidly into fringe land, producing relevant socio-demographic transformations that have determined uneven changes in rural landscapes. A spatially-explicit investigation of local-scale dynamics that characterize population residing in sparse settlements over a long time period (1961-2011)-encompassing distinct phases of urban growth and rural development-is relevant for analysis of local changes in the relationship between sprawl and new forms of rurality. A new concept of 'rurality'-adapting to rapidly-evolving, mixed rural/peri-urban contexts-require reframing the relationship between rural landscapes, scattered settlements, economic cycles and socio-demographic aspects, in the light of a truly sustainable development of local territories. © 2018 by the authors.","Landscape; Metropolitan area; Olive; Sustainable land management","Athens [Attica]; Attica; Greece; demographic transition; landscape change; Mediterranean environment; metropolitan area; rural landscape; settlement pattern; sustainable development; urban growth; urban sprawl; urbanization","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85054924638"

We find a positive effect of union density on social expenditure in co-ordinated market economies, but not in liberal market economies.

This large commercial bank adopted a new German-style universal banking business model from the early 1910s, sharing directors with the firms it financed as a means of controlling its interests.

This 'social determinants' perspective focuses on the myriad demographic and societal factors that shape health and well-being. Heeding calls for the mainstreaming of two very specific health determinants - sex and gender - we incorporate both into our analysis of the health gap experienced by girls and women in Canada. However, we take an intersectional approach in that we argue that a comprehensive picture of health inequities must, in addition to considering sex and gender, include a context sensitive analysis of all the major dimensions of social stratification. In the case of the current worldwide economic downturn, and the uniquely diverse Canadian population spread over a vast territory, this means thinking carefully about how socioeconomic status, race, ethnicity, immigrant status, employment status and geography uniquely shape the health of all Canadians, but especially girls and women. We argue that while a social determinants of health perspective is important in its own right, it needs to be understood against the backdrop of broader structural processes that shape Canadian health policy and practice. By doing so we can observe how the social safety net of all Canadians has been eroding, especially for those occupying vulnerable social locations.","Canada; Gender; Health gap; Intersectionality; Life course; Sex; Social determinants; Social location","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-71749118564"

Town residents can vote to override the 2.5% increase in the levy limit, but not if it exceeds the 2.5% levy ceiling. An override results in a permanent increase in the city or town's levy limit. We look at the role that Proposition 2 1/2 has played in the fiscal conditions of towns in Massachusetts. To do so, we develop a model of Proposition 2 1/2 override activity and local fiscal condition. We estimate the model using panel data on Proposition 2 1/2 override attempts since the mid-1980's as well as other town-level socioeconomic and fiscal information. Using a fixed effects estimator, we find that passing a reasonably sized override can significantly strengthen local fiscal condition, both in the short-run and long-run. Further, previous override attempts increase the likelihood of current override activity. The recent economic downturn has resulted in difficult times for local governments. Cuts in state aid have a disproportionate impact on poorer towns. These towns have been less able to attempt and to pass overrides and hence they have not been able to reap the benefits that this has for their fiscal condition. They are faced with reducing expenditures (e.g. teacher layoffs) or passing overrides to increase revenues. We find that worsening fiscal conditions lead to more overrides so we expect to see more override activity in the near future. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Local fiscal conditions; Tax and expenditure limitations","Massachusetts; United States; economic activity; expenditure; fiscal reform; growth rate; local government; numerical model; panel data; property market; socioeconomic conditions; tax system; urban economy","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-79956275470"

We argue that the experience of individual-level relative deprivation (IRD) is comparable to that of social threat and social exclusion. We draw on a large body of research that suggests the experience of social threat and uncertainty leads to the perception of the world in ethnocentric terms and rejecting pluralistic belief systems. Unlike much of the literature, we focus on individual-level perceptions and distinguish between an objective and subjective relative deprivation. Given our focus on individual-level predictors, we also test for the effects of authoritarian preferences on the likelihood of anti-immigrant bias. Our study demonstrates that unlike objective deprivation, both subjective deprivation and authoritarianism have a significant impact on anti-immigrant sentiments. Furthermore, we find evidence that one component of authoritarian preferences, namely authoritarian submission, moderates the effect of relative deprivation on economic (not cultural) forms of anti-immigrant prejudice. © 2017, Macmillan Publishers Ltd.","Anti-immigrant; Authoritarianism; Fixed effects; Prejudice; Relative deprivation","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85032824879"

Other research has reported that, without any protective measures, deprived communities will be badly hit by austerity. This article uses evidence from fifteen deprived communities to look at the changing incidence of financial difficulties among key at-risk groups, and their associations with mental health, from the pre- to the mid-recession period. High and increasing rates of affordability difficulty were found in respect of the costs of fuel, council tax and clothes, particularly among households with disabled adults, under-occupiers and families with part-time workers. Moreover, increased affordability difficulties were consistently associated with a decline in mental health, at all time periods and for all items of expenditure. The evidence supports a policy counter-narrative focussed on preserving and enhancing mental wellbeing for all rather than the current 'austerity hegemon'.

The sudden onslaught of COVID-19 has taken a heavy toll on China’s macroeconomy and its market participants. Also, the global economic and trade system has tipped into the most severe downturn since World War II. The macro stimulus policy packages launched by various countries are of an epic scale, in a way rarely seen before. China was the first to be hit by the epidemic, to contain the epidemic, and to resume work and production. China’s economic recovery and reconstruction are of landmark and leading significance for the global economy. The content of this report mainly includes the following two aspects: one is to forecast the basic trend and recovery potential of China’s economy under the impact of the epidemic; the other is to provide applicable policy recommendations for post-epidemic economic rehabilitation and its mid- to long-term development. We focus on four issues: the progress and nature of China’s economic recovery at the current stage; major challenges and risks facing China’s economic recovery in the next stage; how to design policies of a sizable scale and policy mechanisms to achieve desired effects; and whether the existing policy is sufficient to cope with various risks and challenges, to enhance resilience and re-consolidate economic foundations. In view of this, the report presents the forecast and prospect of China’s core macroeconomic indicators in 2020 and puts forward policy recommendations accordingly. © 2020 Economic and Political Studies.","China’s macroeconomy; COVID-19 epidemic; economic recovery; macro control","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85098477461"

The pandemic-induced economic downturn and mobility restrictions have left more territories severely exposed to the adverse risk of food desertification. A food desert is a territory where people are food-insecure because of job/income loss or through the absence of food retail facilities. During lockdown, many non-essential firms were forced to close. This meant that many workers, especially those in more precarious positions, lost their jobs, while entrepreneurs had consistent financial shortcomings. Local population mobility was restricted to the municipality of residence, with reduced access to grocery stores outside that area. Disrupted food supply chains and panic buying stimulated short-term food shortages, emptied municipal food stores and meant that supplies often failed to meet local needs. This insecurity left mountain municipalities increasingly vulnerable to desertification. The most food-insecure areas are those that depend heavily on the tourism sector and those with limited access to food retail facilities or other organized forms of food supply in proximity. Their challenges through the period of Covid-19 have heightened questions about their access to food and possible initiatives to increase their food self-sufficiency. Among the initiatives most frequently debated in that period, gardening has been highly valued. This paper contributes to the debate by presenting a Decision Support System (DSS) that calculates the land required for food self-sufficiency in South Tyrolean municipalities and the percentage covered by the production of local urban gardens. The results demonstrate that urban gardens’ contribution to local food self-sufficiency is almost insignificant in these municipalities, representing less than 1 % of the municipal needs. Restricting the analysis to self-sufficiency in fruit and vegetable production only, findings derived from the DSS application confirm the insignificance of urban gardens’ production levels, which remains below 1 % of the municipal needs. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Covid-19; Food desert; Food self-sufficiency; Mountain municipalities; South Tyrol; Urban gardening","Austria; Tyrol; COVID-19; cultivation; decision support system; epidemic; food production; food supply; garden; urban agriculture","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85131968626"

It takes the case of Dutch local governments and, in particular, the instrument of public land development. The analysis focusses on the question whether the economic downturn has given rise to a reconsideration of the intertwinement of public and private roles inherent to public land development. The paper sheds light on the formal changes in land management strategies in the recent years and asks whether these formal institutional changes result in less controversial land management, in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, fairness and democratic legitimation. It concludes that, although at first sight the findings suggest a paradigm shift in Dutch land management strategies, municipalities have not sorted out robust new alternatives. Public land development creates serious path dependencies and current changes in the regulatory space of land management are mostly pragmatic and show lots of traces of the old model. If local authorities keep pursuing their active, entrepreneurial, involvement in the land market in an ad-hoc manner, they face challenges regarding how to keep control over the discretionary power. It raises serious new dilemmas on transparency and predictability of municipal behaviour. There is a risk of ending up in a patchwork situation where different regulatory aspects are changed inconsistently. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Institutional change; Land management; Local government; Public land development","Netherlands; institutional reform; land management; land use planning; local government; property market; regulatory framework; risk assessment","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85050760657"

We hypothesize that natives in vulnerable economic positions, similar to many migrants, are more restrictive toward immigration, because they perceive more economic strain and more ethnic threat. We expect that natives are more restrictive in times of economic decline–when national unemployment rates and debts increase–especially those who hold similar economic positions as many migrants. We enriched European Social Survey data (2002–2013, containing more than 210,000 respondents) with cross-national data on the economic situation. We indeed find that support for immigration restrictiveness is higher among natives in more vulnerable socio-economic positions. They perceive more economic strain, which is directly related to restrictiveness. But economic strain also increases perceptions of ethnic threat, which is strongly related to restrictiveness. We do, however, not find strong empirical evidence that economic decline more strongly affects support for restrictive immigration policies among vulnerable economic groups. Stronger changes in national debts induce more restrictiveness among the full population, but especially among those who perceive more economic strain and more ethnic threat. © 2017 The Author(s).

In both instances security forces forcibly suppressed the protests. Yet the first incident generated almost no public outcry, while the second incident echoed throughout Iran and quickly became a rallying point for revolutionary mobilization. What was different about Iran in mid-1975 and early 1978 that might account for these different reactions? This article examines three widely credited explanations: economic downturn, widening political opportunity, and organizational mobilization of the opposition. The examination of economic and political explanations uncovered little evidence of significant differences between the two time periods; organizational explanations, by contrast, accounted for signficant shifts in 1977 among the moderate and Islamist opposition, with the Islamist opposition in particular exhibiting a sense of optimism and efficacy in the weeks before January 1978. This changed self-perception appears to be the most likely explanation for the wave of protest that followed the suppression of the Qum protest of January 1978. © 2003 by the Social Science History Association.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-2442621118"

The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between job loss and changes in body weight following the Icelandic economic collapse of 2008. The analysis relies on a health and lifestyle survey ""Heilsa og líoan"", carried out by The Public Health Institute of Iceland in the years 2007 and 2009. The sample is a stratified random sample of 9,807 Icelanders between the ages of 18 and 79, with a net response rate of 42.1 % for individuals responding in both waves. A linear regression model was used when estimating the relationship between job loss following the economic collapse and changes in body weight. Family income and mental health were explored as mediators. Point estimates indicated that both men and women gain less weight in the event of a job loss relative to those who retained their employment. The coefficients of job loss were only statistically significant for females, but not in the male population. The results from all three models were inconsistent with results from other studies where job loss has been found to increase body weight. However, body weight has been shown to be procyclical, and the fact that the data used were gathered during a severe economic downturn might separate these results from earlier findings. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.","Body weight; Business cycles; Recessions; Unemployment","Adolescent; Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Body Mass Index; Body Weight; Economic Recession; Family Characteristics; Female; Health Surveys; Humans; Iceland; Male; Middle Aged; Unemployment; Weight Gain; Young Adult; adult; aged; article; body mass; body weight; economic recession; female; health status; health survey; human; income; lifestyle; linear regression analysis; major clinical study; male; mental health; priority journal; random sample; unemployment; adolescent; age; economic recession; epidemiology; family size; Iceland; middle aged; statistics and numerical data; unemployment; weight gain; young adult","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84905569843"

Most sociologists contextualize hikikomori within the economic downturn of Japan and the subsequent economic pressure on individuals, also reflected in the growing number of furītā and NEET. Psychologically, hikikomori is a radical version of the otaku, the Internet and computer addict, who can communicate only within his virtual peer group. However, both sociological theories and popular narratives have recently observed a growing acceptance and even an improvement of the image of these psycho-social patterns. While the story of the charming otaku called Densha otoko (‘train man’) has been adapted into all visual media, some hikikomori, too, have been promoted to manga heroes, e.g., in Takimoto Tatsuhiko’s Welcome to the NHK and Oku Hiroya’s Mēteru no kimochi. Sociologist Ishikawa Ryōko reads hikikomori in her recent field study as a rather positive, though long-term process of self-confirmation. This change in the image of otaku and hikikomori therefore reflects a subliminal revolution of traditional and outdated Japanese concepts of obligation, work, and masculinity. © 2016, © 2016 Walter de Gruyter.","crisis; cultural change; freeter; hikikomori; manga; otaku; psyche","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84937002280"

Basic changes include the weakening and transformation of welfare states in the capitalist West, the collapse or fundamental metamorphosis of bureaucratic party-states in the communist East, and the undermining of developmental states in what had been called the Third World. More generally, recent decades have seen the weakening of national, state-centred economic sovereignty and the emergence and consolidation of a neo-liberal global order. Social, political and cultural life has become increasingly global, on the one hand; on the other hand, they have become increasingly de-centred and fragmented. These changes have occurred against the background of a lengthy period of stagnation and crisis: since the early 1970s, the growth of real wages has decreased dramatically, real wages have remained generally flat, profit rates have stagnated, and labour productivity rates have declined. Yet, these crisis phenomena have not led to a resurgence of working class movements. On the contrary, the past decades have seen the decline of classical labour movements and the rise of new social movements, often characterized by the politics of identity, including nationalist movements, movements of sexual politics and various forms of religious ‘fundamentalism’. Trying to come to terms with the large-scale transformations of the past three decades, then, entails addressing not only the long-term economic downturn since the early 1970s, but also important changes in the character of social and cultural life. © 2010.","","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84940025570"

Although there were recurring recessions when employment fell, these were essentially minor interruptions to an otherwise unprecedently buoyant labour market, and for the most part the unemployment that existed was short term and frictional. Many of the advanced countries seemed to have achieved a workable blend of economic efficiency and social equity Western Europe in particular appeared to be successful in applying the Keynesianwelfarist economic policy model, a form of state intervention in which macroeconomic demand management was used to maintain full employment and a redistributive-tax-and-benefit transfer-based welfare system was used to limit the extremes of wealth and poverty. 1 ments, without doubt, has been the dramatic rise in joblessness: the spectre of mass unemployment has once again been haunting much of the industrialised world. In the 1950s and 1960s, OECD unemployment averaged less than 10 million. During the early 1970s, however, it began to rise, and in the recession of the mid 1970s peaked at 18 million. In the next downturn of the early 1980s it rose again, very sharply, to 30 million. Strong economic expansion in the second half of the 1980s did bring some reprieve, but failed to drive the jobless total back down to the levels of the 1970s, let alone the 1950s and 1960s, and in the early 1990s recession it increased once more to reach 35 million, the highest on record. Thus in the space of two decades, between 1972 and 1992, the number of unemployed in the OECD had tripled. © 1998 Jessica Kingsley Publishers.","","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85139673184"

The authors undertook to fulfill this aim by dividing household expenditures into fixed and variable elements, and investigating each element separately. The analysis is based on data from the State Statistics Service of Ukraine and encompasses the period of 2001-2017. A chi-square test was used to test the selected data. A high propensity of households to consume stimulates a greater internal market size within a country, a correlation which is also an important indicator of competitiveness in Ukraine, where a high proportion of savings of household income is typical. The situation in Ukraine shows a great positive impact of savings to the development of the local financial market. Ukrainian households tend to accumulate savings with the intent of creating a financial safety net for themselves in anticipation of future economic downturns. As is the case in many Central and Eastern European countries, Ukrainian households hold most of their savings in foreign currency and bank deposits. This allocation has proven itself to be resilient to changes in the expected returns of the assets in question. The marginal propensity of Ukrainian households to purchase non-financial assets is small, but relatively stable. The internal crisis in 2014-2016 triggered substantial changes in the financial behavior of Ukrainian households. The post crisis period of 2017 has not yet significantly changed the financial behavior of Ukrainian households. As in the past, today households keep a great deal of cash outside the banking system, with the largest share of the non-financial assets of households held in foreign currency. © 2019 Tomas Bata University in Zlín.

Design/methodology/approach – The sample covers annual reports of companies for financial year 2011-2012. The sample represents both financial and non-financial companies that constitute Nifty 50 Index companies as on March 31, 2012. The actual size of the sample analyzed represented 41 companies. The unweighted disclosure index approach has been used to measure the extent of disclosure of social and environmental information where an item scores 1 if disclosed and 0 if not disclosed. The authors built a model using regression which indicates the variables that are significant in determining the social and environmental disclosure of a company. The regression model can be used to predict the degree of disclosure of a company given the values of explanatory variables. Content analysis from annual reports of the companies has been used in constructing the dependent variable. Findings – Regression results indicate that location (place where the registered office of company is located), number of operations of company, turnover, sales and administration expenses, age of company, employee cost and interest paid by company are significant in determining the disclosure index of the company. Research limitations/implications – Sample size can be increased by considering more companies. In addition, a longitudinal study would enable in drawing comparison over a period of time with respect to disclosure index. The increased sample size would help in validating the disclosure score by dividing the data set into two: one as observation window and the other as validation window.The model explains 23 percent variation in disclosure index. More variation may be explained by incorporating more explanatory variables in the model. Practical implications – The authors indicate the level of disclosure in case of Indian companies which may prove to be an indicator for prospective investors especially in the present era of global financial and economic downturn. The paper may assist the regulators in framing policies regarding corporate governance. This will enable the regulators of corporate sector to frame laws in order to predict the degree of disclosure of a company based on certain explanatory variables.

Design/methodology/approach: Various financial measures for slack resources and performance have been analysed from more than 400 Spanish firms from 2006 (pre-crisis) to 2017 (recovery). Findings: The first finding is that every slack is useful against an economic downturn. The results show how industrial companies use their slack resources when faced with a generalised crisis according to the level of slack possessed. The key role of the available slack against this environmental threatens is remarked. Research limitations/implications: Not every resource is useful against an economic downturn. The results show how industrial companies use their slack resources when faced with a generalised crisis in accordance with the types and levels of slack. The key role of the liquid resources, in particular cash, against this environmental threat is discussed. However, we also observe the behaviour of firms with only a few excess resources and find very similar resource consumption patterns. Originality/value: Although organisational slack is a well-known concept in management, few studies deal with how companies consume or use other types of resources when confronting a crisis.

Over recent years, there is ample evidence in the literature that the working environment in the US has deteriorated significantly, suggesting that suicide rates may not necessarily behave in a counter-cyclical manner with business performance. Utilising recent suicide data, this study empirically tests the hypothesis that adverse working conditions over recent years may have resulted in a pro-cyclical relationship between business performance and suicide. Unlike previous studies, we use a stock market index, a leading macroeconomic indicator, to measure economic conditions from a business perspective. We employ the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) co-integration methodology to study the long-run relationship between monthly S&P500 stock market data and age and gender-specific suicide rates during the period January 1999 to July 2017. Our results highlight substantial differences in age groups responses to fluctuations in business performance. We find a clear positive association between business performance and suicide rates for the youngest males and females aged 15–34 years, indicating that there is a human cost associated with improved business performance. Additionally, we investigate the association between economic insecurity, a unique aspect of the recent deterioration in the working environment, using the Implied Volatility Index “VIX” and age and gender-specific suicide rates. Our findings do not support a population-wide adverse impact of economic insecurity on suicide incidences. The exception was males aged 15–24, and females aged 55–64 for whom we find a significant positive association.

Prior executive compensation research in the US has made assumptions about key input variables that can affect the calculation of option values and financial incentives. Accordingly, biases may have ensued due to incomplete information disclosure about noncurrent option grants. Using new data on a sample of UK CEOs, we value executive option holdings and incentives for the first time and estimate the levels of distortion created by the less than complete US-style disclosure requirements. We also investigate the levels of distortion in the UK for the minority of companies that choose to reveal only partial information. Our results suggest that there have to date been few economic biases arising from less than complete information disclosure. Furthermore, we demonstrate that researchers using US data, who made reasonable assumptions about the inputs of noncurrent option grants, are unlikely to have made significant errors when calculating CEO financial incentives or option wealth. However, the recent downturn in the US stock market could result in the same assumptions, producing exaggerated incentive estimates in the future. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

The period of the analysis spanned 2000 to 2014, and the full period was divided into two halves: before the 2008 global financial crisis and after it. Our empirical model was based on the system generalized method of moments model, and 264 construction companies were used as the study sample. The results of the empirical analysis are as follows. (1) A profitability-driven management strategy limits company growth, thus prolonging the economic downturn; (2) When the macroeconomic environment is relatively stable, high growth in the previous period fosters profitability in the current period. This implies that the phenomenon of dynamic increasing returns is present in the Korean construction industry, and learning through growth enhances productivity and profitability. Consequentially, a strategy oriented towards short-term profitability (popular with small- and medium-sized Korean construction companies) makes the corporate management less resilient, causing them to select ""de-growth"" during the long-term stagnation by decreasing their scale of operations. Accordingly, it is important for companies to maintain the balance between growth and profitability. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Construction companies; Firm's growth; Korea; Long-term recession; Profitability","Korea; construction industry; empirical analysis; macroeconomics; profitability; small and medium-sized enterprise","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84952361264"

A less explored question in this context is how these institutions interact with turns in the economic cycle and the impact of different types of legal procedures on credit market performance. This paper fills these gaps by analyzing how differences in the availability of credit and the evolution of non-performing loans ratios may be partially explained by regional variations in the quality of loan contract enforcement during recent periods of sustained growth (2001–2007) and recession (since 2008) in the Spanish economy. This research concludes that a rise in the clearance rate of executions (i.e., when a judge enforces the repayment of a debt) increases the ratio of total credit to GDP. However, the declaratory stage of the procedure (i.e., when a debt is firstly verified by a judge) does not seem to be statistically significant. A possible explanation to this finding is that, throughout the economic cycle, a relevant proportion of the defaults that take place are strategic (i.e., defaults by a solvent debtor). Furthermore, it is observed that, in regions where declaratory procedures are more efficient, less credit is declared as non-performing. The latter effect, however, is only observed after the onset of the “Great Recession” in 2008. This may be related to the increase of non-strategic defaults during a downturn. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Credit availability; Enforcement institutions; Legal procedures; Non-performing loans ratio","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85013782228"

However, for immigrants, the break-up of physical contact with family members is an enduring feature of vulnerability in their communication with origins (often in developing countries). On the whole, family relationships are transformed: the absence of physical contact is traded-off with remittances sent home to family members. Remittances create potential for resilience by increasing human development of children, while reducing extreme poverty at the local level. Remittance flows are also an important source of foreign exchange for countries of origin. However, labour markets' polarization, backlash, and economic downturns at destinations (often in developed countries), and governments' moral hazard, currency revaluation, and production inertia at origins recreate vulnerabilities and disrupt the potential build-up of resilience. In fact, the re-creation of vulnerabilities largely outweighs the generation of resilience threads. The paper develops a typology that highlights the dynamic interaction between vulnerabilities and resilience, revealing the multiple aspects of people and remittances flows, the potential for mainstreaming migration policies into economic development, and the scale of the policy task to reduce vulnerabilities associated to international labour migration. © 2011 The Author.

Our results provide several interesting findings. First, for both countries, we noted several structural breaks associated with well-known economic downturns, oil shocks, debt crises and financial crashes. Second, public debt dynamics seem to be characterized by various threshold effects that can improve the modeling and forecasting of public debt evolution. It is important to note that public debts vary significantly according to the regime and that a regime can be induced by specific macroeconomic factors. Keeping a close eye on such factors may help economists and policymakers to better control future public debt evolutions. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Nonlinearity; Public debt; Threshold models","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84884989934"

For most companies around the world, resources have been reduced, inventory drained, technology spending curtailed, and core processes scaled back in order to adjust to the current reality of reduced demand. In an uncertain recovery, supply chain operations need to be more scalable and flexible as they anticipate economic recovery and increase capacity. Moreover, this can be easier to achieve coming out of a severe recession. Design/methodology/approach: This work first explains why scalability and flexibility benefits are potentially easier to achieve when rebuilding supply chain operations out of a severe downturn. Second, a rationale is provided to show how a scalable and flexible supply chain mitigates multiple risks from economic uncertainty during a recovery where a more traditional fixed-cost approach does not. Third, a four-step approach is described that businesses can follow to identify and capture supply chain opportunities where a scalable and flexible model might be most sensible to consider. Findings: More scalable, variable cost supply chain operations have clear advantages over more traditional cost ones, especially when the economic recovery includes a high level of uncertainty and there is a risk of reentering a renewed recessionary period. There may be no better time than now for enterprises in any industry to consider adopting a more variable cost supply chain to limit risk and capture the most revenue growth opportunity. Originality/value: The concepts of centralization, utilizing temporary and part-time labor, and outsourcing are certainly not new ones and many companies have already benefited from adopting these ideas in their supply chains. However, it has not been widely recognized that these same concepts pose heightened and renewed opportunity for any business across industries because of how the global recession has changed their business landscape. Since companies have already downsized labor forces, drained inventory levels, closed facilities, and cut other costs dramatically, there is a tremendous opportunity to evaluate new, more variable-cost business models as they grow operations to meet renewed demand. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Business development; Recession; Supply chain management","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-77957873024"

Findings: The legacies of the latecomer industrialisation and the semi-peripheral development model still shape the Spanish economy and IR. The impact of the current economic and political-institutional crisis affects the entire institutional IR system and its actors shifting power towards the individual employer thus weakening trade unions, labour rights and collective bargaining. Regarding the theoretical debate on corporatism, the Spanish case provides ambiguous results.

However, preexisting structural imbalances in the US economy were the reason why the burst of speculative bubbles induced a general economic collapse. This article argues that the imbalance created by the combination of stagnant labor earnings and surging corporate profits not only played a leading role in the run-up to the downturns but also was chiefly responsible for the slow recoveries. On the one hand, the relative stagnation of labor income represented a key factor behind rising income inequality and a potential drag on consumption which was temporarily alleviated by credit expansion; hence, the rising household debt levels eventually became unsustainable. On the other hand, rising corporate profits created an overhang of idle money, eager to lend itself to speculative ventures, which played a key role in fueling the stock market bubble of the 1920s and the housing bubble of the 2000s. The article further argues that despite various superficial and deeper similarities between the circumstances surrounding the Great Recession and the Great Depression, some fundamental differences in the structure of the US economy then and now suggest vastly different future prospects for American capitalism. © The Author 2016.","","United States; comparative study; economic growth; economic history; Great Depression; income; profitability; stock market","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85014486206"

The findings suggest that electricity mix transitions caused by long-run growth in per capita incomes are indeed the primary determinant of carbon Kuznets curve downturns.

In contrast, working and middle-class youth are less concerned about the recession long term and more inclined to express hopeful and individualistic attitudes about their futures.

We hypothesized that (a) job loss would be positively associated with psychological distress (i.e., higher levels of depressive symptoms) and increased drunkenness, and (b) low levels of family social support and experiences of racial stigma would exacerbate the effects of job loss on distress, especially among African Americans and Hispanics. Method: Data were drawn from the 2010 U.S. National Alcohol Survey (NAS), a crosssectional survey of the U.S. general population. Using data from the 2010 NAS (telephone survey of 1,111 African American, 964 Hispanic, and 3,133 White adults), we conducted simultaneous path modeling in Mplus to test mediation and moderation hypotheses. Our key outcome was AUD as measured by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition. Results: Recession-related job loss was significantly associated with AUD through its effects on increased drunkenness, and the associations were positive for Whites, stronger for African Americans than Whites, and nonexistent for Hispanics. Job loss was associated with distress in the overall sample, and distress was positively associated with drunkenness among African Americans only, suggesting that distress is another pathway by which job loss affects AUD among African Americans. Higher levels of family social support mitigated the effects of job loss on psychological distress, and this relationship did not differ by race/ethnicity. Conclusions: During economic downturns, increased stress and heavy drinking are important pathways through which recession-related job loss can lead to greater AUD among African Americans relative to Whites. © 2016, Alcohol Research Documentation Inc.

In an economic downturn when most workers face falling real wages is it appropriate to let the MW fall or are the positive effects of the MW on inequality enough to justify its uprating - and if so what might be the consequences on a country's employment level? This paper reports new estimates of the employment effects of the MW by focusing on the recessionary experiences across countries. Using international data we exploit: cross-national variation in the level and timing of the MW uprating and the exact timing of the recessionary experiences in different countries with a panel data set comprising 33 OECD over the period 1971-2009. Our panel data allow us to differentiate the effect of MWs on employment in periods of economic downturn as well as periods of economic growth. We also account for institutional and other policy related differences that might have an impact on employment other than the MW. We find that the answer depends on whether one considers adults or young people, and to some extent, on what measure of the MW is considered. The answer is also somewhat sensitive to whether one considers that the MW level is a choice option of the government which is inextricably interrelated to the determination of employment - that is, the extent to which the MW is endogenous. Using a 'political complexion of the government' instrumental variable (IV) we find that the MW only has a negative impact on youth employment. This leaves each government with the dilemma of raising the MW and reducing inequality or increasing the MW and accepting that this will reduce employment levels amongst young people and those on the margins of work. © CEPR, CES, MSH, 2012.","","economic growth; employment; employment generation; income distribution; OECD; spatial variation; wage determination","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84855963281"

By reclassifying financial assets, a bank can potentially avoid recognizing the unrealized fair value losses and thereby increase its income and regulatory capital during a market downturn. We examine the implications of the reclassification decision by banks for the properties of financial analyst earnings forecasts during 2008-2009, when economic conditions were highly volatile. We find that the reclassification choice during the financial crisis reduced analyst forecast accuracy and increased forecast dispersion.

Contrary to both evidence from previous fiscal stimulus programs and standard theories of legislative politics, we do not find evidence of substantial political targeting. The districts of party leaders did not receive more funds than those of rank and-file legislators, nor did the districts of pivotal voters in the Senate or swing voters in the House receive more money. While Democratic districts overall received more per resident than Republican districts, this differential nearly disappears when we consider award per worker in each district or when we control for district poverty rate. Democratic states did receive modestly greater funds, but this is largely due to higher levels of funding going to places with more generous state welfare programs. At the same time, we find no relationship between the amount awarded and measures of the severity of the downturn in the local economy, while we do find more funds flowing to districts with higher levels of economic activity and greater incidence of poverty. The results are consistent with the discretionary component of ARRA being allocated through funding formulas or based on project characteristics other than countercyclical efficacy or political expediency, which stands in contrast to evidence from fiscal stimulus in the New Deal.

In this paper, we analyze the causes of the prolonged slowdown of the Japanese economy (the lost decade). Economics Nobel laureate Paul Krugman has argued that Japan's lost decade is an example of a liquidity trap. However, our empirical analysis shows that stagnation of the Japanese economy comes from its vertical IS curve rather than a horizontal LM curve, so the Japanese economy has been facing structural problems rather than a temporary downturn. The vertical IS curve is caused by an insensitivity of investment to a lower interest rate partly because of the decline of sales due to the aging population and firms not wanting to invest. The structural problems come from the aging demographic, which is often neglected by scholars and policy-makers, and also from the allocation of transfers from the central government to local governments, and the unwillingness of Japanese banks to lend money to startup businesses and small and medium enterprises (SMEs), mainly because of Basel capital requirements. Many countries, like China, are expected to face similar issues, particularly given the aging population. The present paper will address why the Japanese economy has been trapped in a prolonged slowdown and provide some remedies for revitalizing the economy. © 2016 Institute of World Economics and Politics, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.","Aging population; Japan's lost decade; Japanese economy; Vertical IS curve","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84961625676"

The current COVID-19 pandemic, however, has ground global tourism to a halt. In particular, islands that depend heavily on tourist inflows—including mass-tourism islands, and small island developing states (SIDS)—have seen their revenues diminish significantly, and poverty rates increasing. Some alternative-tourism islands have fared better, as they have focused on providing personalized, nature-based experiences to mostly domestic tourists. This article focuses on the experiences of mass-tourism islands, SIDS, and alternative-tourism islands during the COVID-19 pandemic, and offers possible post-pandemic scenarios, as well as recommendations for sustainable island tourism development. Although the pandemic has largely had a negative impact on the tourism sector, this is a unique opportunity for many islands to review the paradigm of tourism development. In this newly emerging world, and under a still very uncertain future scenario, the quadriptych of sustainability is more important than ever.

However, earlier studies do not investigate if the intensity of such jumps appears to be higher amid periods of extreme volatility in comparison to normal periods. Employing the GARCH-jump model, this study examines whether jumps occurring in energy prices are an indicator of market crashes. To serve this purpose, we consider several downturns in oil markets spanning over the last few years. Our empirical analyses reveal that the conditional expected number of jumps in WTI and Brent oil futures prices increases significantly amid the depression periods, which is, however, not the case when the market functions normally. We, therefore, conclude that such clusters of jumps may contain predictive information for oil market crashes and thus provide early signals of future downturns. The findings further show that crude oil volatility, the US equity VIX, and economic policy uncertainty play a significant role in explaining the time-dependent jumps during the turmoil periods. The findings of our research could be useful for investors participating in global crude oil markets and for policymakers watching out for the impact of energy prices on the economy. © 2022 The Author(s)","Jump intensities; Market crash; Oil prices; Time-varying jumps; Uncertainty indexes; Volatility","United States; Commerce; Costs; Financial markets; Investments; Planning; Energy prices; Jump intensity; Market crash; Oil market; Oil Prices; Time varying; Time-varying jump; Uncertainty; Uncertainty index; Volatility; crude oil; empirical analysis; energy market; future prospect; price dynamics; uncertainty analysis; Crude oil","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138065091"

The downturn is characterised by a collapse in investment and gross trade. The cost rises dramatically if the default is followed by a systemic banking crisis – peaking at some 9.5% of GDP – but is attenuated for economies with floating exchange rates.

In addition, we review evidence related to the effectiveness of different policy measures undertaken in past crises to protect access to health services, especially for the poor and vulnerable. The current global crisis is unique both in terms of its scale and origins. Unlike most previous instances, the current crisis has its origins in developed countries, initially the United States, before it spread to middle- and lower-income countries. The current crisis is now affecting almost all countries at all levels of income. This chapter addresses several key questions aimed at helping inform possible policy responses to the current crisis from the perspective of the health sector: What is the nature of the current crisis and in what ways does it differ from previous experiences? What are some of the key lessons from previous crises? How have governments responded previously to protect health from such macroeconomic shocks? How can we improve the likelihood of positive action today? Methodology/approach - The chapter reviews the literature on the impact of financial crises on health outcomes and health expenditures and on the effectiveness of past policy efforts to protect human development during periods of economic downturn. It also presents analysis of household surveys and health expenditure data to track health seeking behavior and out-of-pocket expenditures by households during times of financial crisis. Findings - Evidence from previous crises indicates that health-related impacts during economic downturns can occur through various channels. The impact in households experiencing reductions in employment and income could be manifest in terms of poorer nutritional outcomes and lower levels of utilization of healthcare when needed. Households may become impoverished, reduce needed health services, and experience reductions in consumption as a result of health shocks occurring during a time when their economic vulnerability has increased. Women, children, the poor, and informal sector workers are likely to be most at risk of experiencing negative health-related consequences in a crisis. Real government spending per capita on health care could decline due to reduced revenues, currency devaluations, and potential reductions in external aid flows. Low-income countries with weak fiscal positions are likely to be the most vulnerable. Implications for policy - Past crises can inform policy-making aimed at protecting health outcomes and reducing financial risk from health shocks. Evidence from previous crises indicates that broad-brush strategies that maintained overall levels of government health spending tended not to be successful, failing to protect access to quality health services especially for the poor. It is particularly vital to ensure access to essential health commodities, which in many low-income countries are imported, in the face of weakening exchange rates. Focused efforts to sustain the supply of lower-level basic services, combined with targeted demand-side approaches like conditional cash transfers may be more effective than broader sectoral approaches. Low-income countries may need specific short-term measures to ensure that health outcomes do not suffer. © Published by Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","","Delivery of Health Care; Economic Recession; Financial Management; Financing, Personal; Health Expenditures; Health Policy; economic recession; economics; financial management; health care cost; health care delivery; health care policy; review","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-77951963414"

Assuming a non-neutral role of space on birth rates, the present study investigates the spatio-temporal evolution (1952–2018) of total fertility rate (TFR) at regional scale in Italy, a country with intense decline of births and enlarged socioeconomic divides between the wealthiest Northern regions and the most disadvantaged Southern regions. A progressive reduction of the traditional North–South fertility divide was observed in Italy since the 1980s with a rapid decline of TFR. Results of descriptive statistics and time series analysis indicate that regional fertility in Italy was increasingly associated with economic downturns. Considering the spatial response of birth rates to economic expansions and recessions, heterogeneous regional fertility trends underlie more individualistic behaviors that reflect a different propensity to childbearing in recent times. With both expansion and recession, fertility rates in Northern Italy—thanks to the contribution of internal and international migrations—were responding more rapidly to economic downturns than in Southern Italy—a disadvantaged region with a more stagnant population, emigration and aging, reverting the typical framework of the 1950s. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Economic downturns; Mediterranean Europe; Spatial clustering; Total fertility rate","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85074751590"

Technological advances, i.e. increases in ship size, demand growth in trade volumes and concentration in the liner shipping industry, are constant drivers of change in the structure of liner services. What has been the effect of market concentration in the liner shipping industry on emerging markets in terms of service levels and competition? Based on the analyses of the evolution of liner shipping services in the period from 2000 to 2009, this research addresses the expansion of hierarchical liner service network structures and market concentration, focussing on South America as an example of emerging markets.

(2012) under normal and crisis economic conditions. In these simulations, firms in the middle of the supply chain are allowed to (i) forward vertically integrate by buying over one of its customers, (ii) backward vertically integrate by buying over one of its suppliers, or (iii) horizontally merge with a competitor to pool capital and resources. We extracted from these simulations the lifetime distributions of undiversified firms, and of firms adopting the three diversification strategies described above. We then compare the average lifetimes and the rates at which the midsections and tails of the cumulative lifetime distributions decay for these four types of firms. Based on these comparisons, we found that forward vertical integration most effectively extends the lifetimes of middlemen firms during a financial crisis, but also makes them less resilient to sudden economic downturns. In contrast, backward vertically integrated firms most successfully weather such downturns. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Agent-based modeling; Company lifetime; Diversification; Financial crisis; Supply chain network","Finance; Supply chains; Agent-based model; Diversification; Diversification strategies; Economic condition; Financial crisis; Life-time distribution; Supply chain network; Vertical integration; Industry","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84896874690"

To assess the distinctive impact of economic downturns on population dynamics, the present study illustrates the results of an exploratory analysis that assesses urban expansion and rural decline at various temporal scales in Greece, a peripheral country in southeastern Europe. Statistical analysis based on multivariate exploratory techniques outlined the persistent increase of regional populations, evidencing the distinctive role of agglomeration/scale with urbanization and early suburbanization phases (1940-1980) and accessibility/amenities with late suburbanization and re-urbanization phases (1981-2019). Recession accompanied (and, in some way, consolidated) the decline of agglomeration economies, leading to counter-urbanization in some cases. As an indirect result of counter-urbanization, the population increased more rapidly in low-density coastal areas with moderate accessibility and tourism specialization. Consistently, settlement expansion has altered the persistent gap in central and peripheral locations.

We focus on Spain—a country hit hard by unemployment increases in downturns. We find that unemployment outs are crucial in understanding changes in unemployment rates in Spain as well as to understand the gender convergence in unemployment rates. Among the determinants of the large drop in unemployment outs, lack of demand and negative state dependence emerge as key sources, which affect men more negatively than women. In a scenario of upcoming recovery, unemployment outs will increase for short-term unemployed, particularly for males. On the contrary, both male and female long-term unemployed workers will face enormous difficulties to access a job, as the job access rates for long-term unemployed is not sensitive to the economic cycle. Hence, we expect that the gender convergence in unemployment rates will persist only when considering the long-term unemployed. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Gender differentials; Hazard rates; Oaxaca decomposition; Unemployment gross flows","Spain; business cycle; decomposition analysis; gender issue; social security; unemployment","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85009446406"

The case of Sheffield’s city centre master planning is used to analyze how the city was reimagined from the early 1990s to the mid-2010s, and how the economic, cultural, social and political dimensions of urban regeneration were addressed. The paper argues that, in comparison to the post-war, welfare-state master plans, the master plans of the neoliberal period had a narrower spatial and thematic focus, linking place qualities to economic considerations, to be delivered through real estate investment. As such, social considerations were marginalized and, when a major economic crisis occurred, the new generation master plans’ lack of flexibility and vulnerability to economic fluctuations became apparent, much the same as their predecessors. This shows how master plans can be effective instruments for mobilizing investment and coordinating development around a selective spatial vision in periods of economic growth, but their utility is severely curtailed in economic downturns, when their coordinative potential is much diminished.

This note focuses on some potential effects on the achievement of the UN Sustainable Development Goal 2 ‘Zero Hunger’ (Target 2.1) and, specifically, on the prevalence of undernourishment. After discussing the main changes induced by the Covid19 outbreak in various dimensions of food security, as identified by the preliminary literature on the topic, the note presents the dynamic estimates (GMM) of the recent determinants of food security, measured through the prevalence of undernourishment (SDG indicator 2.1.1), using a sample of 84 developing countries observed over the period 2000–2017. Since the rate of economic growth turns out to be a relevant determinant, the analysis quantifies the potential consequences that the economic downturn caused by the pandemic may have on the short- and long-run achievements of SDG 2 if proper counterbalancing measures will not be implemented. Such consequences in the short run would consist of millions of new undernourished people, while in the long run the progress made towards the ‘Zero Hunger’ goal are at risk of being completely reversed in the majority of countries. The note concludes by suggesting some directions for future research. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Covid19 pandemic; Economic growth; Food security; Hunger","COVID-19; Food Supply; Goals; Humans; Hunger; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; achievement; Article; conceptual framework; consumer price index; coronavirus disease 2019; developing country; economic development; economic recession; food availability; food intake; food security; human; hunger; income distribution; income inequality; malnutrition; methodology; motivation; pandemic; prevalence; risk attitude; risk factor; social inclusion; sustainable development; zero hunger; catering service; hunger; pandemic","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85105414341"

However, context factors are not per se stable; they tend to vary over time which is particularly relevant during economic cycles. In Germany, for instance, the rapid economic downturn of 2008/2009 was preceded by a period of growth and followed by an economic upswing in many regions. However, the impact of this crisis on entrepreneurship has not been empirically studied comprehensively. Using data from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM), we analyse entrepreneurial activities in the 39 German NUTS2 regions covering a 13-year period before, during and after the Great Recession of 2008/2009. Applying multilevel regression techniques, we hypothesize that both space and time matter for individual entrepreneurial behaviour. Our results show, first, that space and time can be regarded as two interrelated dimensions that jointly impact entrepreneurial activities. Second, similar individual attributes are associated with diverging likelihoods of becoming an entrepreneur in case individuals are nested in different regions or different time periods and are thus exposed to dissimilar context conditions. Third, the type and number of individual, context and interaction effects are motive-related, i.e. they depend on whether the entrepreneurial action is either opportunity-driven or necessity-driven. © 2014, Walter de Gruyter GmbH.

From this perspective, low-cost country sourcing has proved to be an effective means to realize cost-saving targets. Although many external key success factors have been identified, relatively little is known about intra-firm factors that can influence the outcome of low-cost country sourcing initiatives. On the basis of a pan-European survey conducted among senior purchasing managers of 200 large-sized multinationals, Martin Lockström identifies internal key success factors of companies sourcing in low-cost countries.

To capture the effect of the “2008’ World economic crisis,” we compared the behaviors of organizations and employees’ unethical behavior during a crisis with their behavior in more favorable circumstances before and after the crisis. We used structural equation modeling to analyze answers collected from 2024 employees in Slovenian organizations between 2006 and 2016. The results showed significant growth of organizational engagement in ethical behavior, despite the crisis in the middle of the observed period. The employees’ unethical behavior was significantly less acceptable in crisis compared to before the crisis, while after the crisis, its acceptability increased again, despite not significant. The aggregate sample revealed a significantly negative influence of employee’s unethical behavior on organizations’ ethical behavior that was not significantly different across the considered periods. The research suggests the need to manage the organization’s ethical behavior in times of economic downturn, like in the present COVID 19.

A questionnaire was used to gather data on recent entrepreneurial initiatives by women in Northern Portugal. Structural equation models validated the links between women's dual role (family/business) and their psychological/cognitive profiles, their business start-up propensity and the firms' success. The study suggests that while a correlation exists between motivation and business environment that positively influenced women's start-up decisions and subsequent success, the motives underpinning decisions in rural and urban contexts differ. However, women prove capable of effectively managing their dual role as wife/mother and entrepreneur regardless of territorial context. The paper confirms women's capacity to reconcile the demands of work and family as a key variable, offers tentative conclusions as to how the current economic and financial crisis may influence women's entrepreneurial motivation, and recommends new directions in research that may better inform entrepreneurship theory, practice, policies and teaching.

While the economic downturn in Indonesia has been modest compared with downturns in peer countries, Indonesia’s handling of the pandemic has been lacking. Almost a year into the pandemic, the country was still struggling with the first wave of infection as the number of new cases reported each day continued to rise. Facing criticism over the government’s handling of the pandemic, President Joko Widodo reshuffled his cabinet at the end of 2020. This Survey examines Indonesia’s plans to manage a longer-than-expected recovery from the effects of the pandemic. We see that much of the labour market is adjusting to widespread loss of employment by shifting into the agricultural sector. We also see an increase in informal employment, leading to a lower unemployment rate than expected. We argue that the pandemic has exacerbated Indonesia’s long-standing structural problems. In addition to responding to the immediate crisis issues, the government must start addressing medium-term challenges and seizing reform opportunities. We discuss the existing recovery policies, including the vaccination strategy and the omnibus law on job creation. We argue that the omnibus law alone is necessary but will not be enough to improve the investment climate and create jobs for economy recovery and long-term structural transformation. © 2021 ANU Indonesia Project.","Covid-19; economic growth; Indonesia; investment; structural reform","Indonesia; COVID-19; economic analysis; economic growth; economic reform; economic structure; financial crisis; investment","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85104776020"

Using data from private German renewable energy firms at a time following the global financial crisis, we find that only firms with low ambidexterity achieve performance stability in light of demand-pull policies. This research draws attention to the relevance of stability as a policy-relevant performance measure during times of economic crises. Further, we suggest that greater insight into the interplay of managerial and political factors is necessary to enable policy makers to support the stability of certain industries during crises. © 2021 The Author(s)","Ambidexterity; Economic crisis; Entrepreneurship; Performance stability; Public policy; Renewable energy technologies","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85107874193"

To answer this, we summarized the manufacturing industry into 3-digit sub-sector (25 sub-sectors) and evaluated the entire manufacturing industry. Our study covers 15 years of production cycles (2000–2014). Using data envelopment analysis and loglinear learning models, we empirically estimated the productivity and technological learning of these industries. The result shows negative (− 0.6%) total factor productivity (TFP) growth between 2000 and 2014. TFP was particularly affected by 2001, and 2008/2009 financial crisis. TFP regress also deepened in recent years (2011–2014) which we blamed on both internal and external shocks in the system. We showed that positive TFP observed in other years resulted from technical progress and efficiency improvement. Industry-level results were consistent with the annual mean result which suggest a common economic downturn. Estimated progress ratios from learning models show that individual industry exhibits unique learning rates, with some industries showing technological learning (i.e., decreasing unit cost of production) between 2000 and 2007 and others between 2010 and 2014. Industries viz. production machinery, electrical devices and circuit, chemical, pharmaceutical, and food manufacturing showed sustained learning between 2001 and 2013, implying huge cost saving as outputs expand. The overall result, however, showed that learning got worst and was lost at some point between 2008 and 2014. We conclude that productivity differentials explained by learning rates show that technological progress and innovations in Japanese manufacturing were capital intensive and cost inefficient and that Japanese manufacturing industry has not fully regained its competitiveness as the world’s leading manufacturing hub. We argued that for productivity improvement in Japanese manufacturing industries, there is a need for policy thrust to restore and ensure sustained learning within and across the industries. © 2019, The Japan Section of the Regional Science Association International.","Efficiency; Learning-by-doing; Manufacturing Industry; Productivity; Technological learning; Total-factor-productivity","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089915560"

In this paper, we applied the forward-looking conditional value at risk (COVaR) as a market-based systemic risk measure to analyse the systemic risk in an emerging market. A network representation of asset exposures is presented based on the values of ΔCoVaR. According to the exposure networks, two new network-based indices are introduced. Furthermore, regarding the dependence of the new indices on the values of forward-looking CoVaR, they are applied as the indicators for the proposed early warning system to predict downturns and crises in the level of firms and the whole market. The results of the early warning system for the market return show that the indicators based on both proposed models have a good ability to predict the crises in the market. In other words, the indicators issued a warning signal up to seven periods before the real crisis in the market. Similarly, the results of the early warning system to predict downturns at the level of firms also indicate the ability of indicators to issue the true warning signals. The results of the proposed system can help policymakers and authorities to determine the appropriate microprudential and macroprudential policies to avoid systemic risks. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","CoVaR; early warning systems; network theory; spillover risk; systemic risk","early warning system; econometrics; economic policy; financial crisis; network analysis; numerical model; policy making; spillover effect","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85076358770"

Although largely ignored by political science, the polities in the region share a long history of democratic governance as well as extreme vulnerability to adverse weather conditions and global economic fluctuations. The Caribbean thus offers unusually fertile opportunities for research on the capacity of voters to make rational electoral decisions. Two key questions are addressed. First, to what extent do citizens of the Caribbean punish incumbents for exogenous economic and climatic shocks? Second, what factors, if any, help to insulate democratic leaders from blame for conditions largely outside their control? Contrary to recent research on natural disasters and economic downturns in other contexts, the analysis provides no evidence that voting in the Caribbean has been characterized by systematic attribution errors or electoral myopia.

This problem is well known, yet persistent. We argue here that, in light of predictable federalism and political economy dynamics, states will be unable to change this situation on their own. Additionally, we note that many possible federal remedies may result in worse problems, such as by creating moral hazard that would induce states to take on excessively risky policy, both fiscal and otherwise. Thus, we argue that policymakers should consider so-called ""automatic"" stabilizers, such as are found in the federal tax system, and we offer original empirical evidence that these stabilizers can have significant fiscal impact. Our evidence focuses on the federal alternative minimum tax (AMT). We present an argument from microeconomic foundations suggesting that the AMT has potentially salutary-and heretofore unrecognized-effects that counteract pathologies of state budgets over the business cycle. AMT liability increases with income, and acts to eliminate federal tax subsidies for state revenue raising. Thus in flush times, when a state's income grows so that the AMT hits more state residents, state spending becomes more expensive as the federal tax subsidy for state and local taxes is reduced. Conversely, when state fiscal health deteriorates, the federal tax subsidy grows as fewer state residents fall under the AMT, boosting taxpayer support for state spending. This stabilizing mechanism has the potential to overcome problems state politicians face committing to saving during boom times and spending during bust times. We present empirical evidence suggesting that the AMT does indeed provide some degree of fiscal stabilization in accordance with microeconomic theory. We also provide policy suggestions regarding how the AMT could be modified to leverage this stabilization effect. Calls to ""reform"" the AMT predate the recent economic downturn. AMT reform has appeared in many congressional stimulus proposals, but significant cutbacks are unlikely as federal deficits are projected to grow for the foreseeable future. Our argument here implies that any AMT reform effort should consider whether the AMT's stabilizer function could be replaced by any other viable mechanism.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-78650409892"

Use of traditional care diminished more than either lay biomedical or biomedical care at Time 2, despite it being the cheapest option.

While many studies have examined the effect of immigration on election outcomes, few have probed the effect of asylum seekers – those fleeing strife and persecution – on voting, nor has there been much research on the mediating role of local economic conditions. Drawing on county level panel data from Germany, our study fills both gaps. We find that economic circumstances, as measured by the unemployment rate and the level of disposable income, condition voters’ responses to the presence of asylum seekers, but the effects for parties on the far right and left diverge markedly. Under economic prosperity, immigration increases support on both sides of the political spectrum. As economic conditions worsen, however, the effect of asylum seekers on the vote share for the far right remains stable, but weakens for the left, eventually becoming negative. This divergence – which has not yet been reported in the literature – suggests that an influx of asylum seekers, particularly when coupled with an economic downturn, could tilt a political system rightwards. From a policy perspective, these results suggest that heterogeneity arising from local economic conditions has important implications for the regional allocation of asylum seekers. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Asylum seekers; Fractional response; Immigration; Voting outcomes","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85098074212"

Over that cycle, world asset prices, leverage, and capital flows move in concert with global growth, especially influencing the fortunes of emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs). This paper documents that dollar appreciation shocks predict economic downturns in EMDEs and highlights policies countries could implement to dampen the effects of dollar fluctuations. Dollar appreciation shocks themselves are highly correlated not just with tighter US monetary policies but also with measures of US domestic and international dollar funding stress that themselves reflect global investors’ risk appetite. After the initial market panic and upward dollar spike at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the dollar fell as global financial conditions eased; but the higher inflation that followed has induced central banks everywhere to tighten monetary policies more recently. The dollar has strengthened considerably since mid-2021 and a contractionary phase of the global financial cycle is now underway. Owing to increases in public- and business-sector debts during the pandemic, a strong dollar, higher interest rates, and slower economic growth will be challenging for EMDEs. © 2023 The Brookings Institution.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85162660690"

Simultaneously, many countries were also facing increasing public deficits. In this context, the EU developed a set of policies to tackle youth unemployment and public debt. While policies to fight unemployment were underpinned by the concept of social investment, austerity was seen as the best way to reduce public debt. These different approaches to the crisis led to a growing tension between the two policy areas. This problem was particularly visible in the countries most affected by the sovereign debt crisis where youth unemployment remained very high for a long period of time. Not only were countries with high public debt and low growth unable to invest sufficiently in active labour market policies (ALMPs), but also, at the same time, austerity policies depressed the economic activity. This study uses the fsQCA methodology. Our results point to the existence of one necessary condition for high youth unemployment—low expenditure on ALMPs. The analysis of sufficient conditions points to the existence of one configuration: the countries most affected by the sovereign debt crisis and characterized by having a demand-led growth model, combined a low GDP growth with a low expenditure on ALMPs. Together, this led to high levels of youth unemployment. © 2019, Springer Nature Limited.","Labour market policies; QCA; Social investment; Sovereign debt crisis; Structural reforms; Youth unemployment","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85063770731"

The study enriches our understanding of the contributions of bootstrapping and improvisation strategies toward resource-constrained small businesses during real economic downturns and crises. The potential moderating effect of SI on the relationship between FBS and its dimensions and performance were also examined. Design/methodology/approach: Using the convenience snowball sampling technique, data were collected from entrepreneurs in Tripoli, Libya. Structural equation modeling by means of partial least square bootstrapping resampling was used for the hypotheses testing of the 147 useable responses. Findings: Statistically significant positive relationships were found in the direct relationships between bootstrapping and improvisation with performance. However, there was no significant association found between the delaying payment related bootstrapping and the owner-related bootstrapping with performance. The moderating effect of improvisation had a significant relationship between bootstrapping as an aggregate construct and its dimensions and performance. Research limitations/implications: Due to the cross-sectional nature of this study which used a small sample that was randomly selected, generalization to the entire population of business ventures should be made with caution. Practical implications: The negative moderation effect of improvisation on FBS-BP association suggests that entrepreneurs need to be careful in balancing the two strategies so that efforts are no wasted. Originality/value: While business performance has been studied in various organizations, its examination with financial bootstrapping strategies as a predictor and strategic improvisation as a moderator contribute nascent theoretical insights. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Business performance; Crisis; Financial bootstrapping strategies; Strategic improvisation","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85088249164"

We first assess overall patterns and find these inequalities to depend on grade and other vulnerability factors. For instance, girls are disadvantaged in comparison with boys only in rural families and within primary and junior secondary school. We then examine historical changes in schooling inequalities, distinguishing between long-term trends and net changes during crisis years. We find that the inequalities associated with sex of pupil and family size have increased. Results underscore the importance of economic conditions in sustaining progress in closing gaps in education between the sexes. They also suggest that fertility and family size are of growing significance for schooling in African settings.","Africa; Economic recession; Education inequalities; Educational status of women; Family size; School enrolments","Cameroon; economic conditions; educational attainment; family structure; socioeconomic status","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0042267913"

Our data lend support to the former view, since we do not detect any downturn in our early modern rural wages. This observation informs the little divergence debate. By comparing rural rather than urban wages and stable rather than casual ones, we find that annual English earnings rose from being only 10 per cent higher than those in Italy in 1650 to being a staggering 150 per cent higher in 1800.

In a global economy rebounding from the economic downturn caused by the Covid-19 outbreak and demanding more workers, a high rate of resignations has exacerbated labor shortages and may be aggravating unemployment and underemployment rates if many workers are not participating at all in the labor force or only working part time. Many reasons have been offered to explain this ‘Great Resignation’ including high day care costs for working parents that may in turn be causing the trend of lower female labor force participation; the supposed ‘liberating’ experience of not working at all or to work from home instead of having to work from one’s usual work place during the Covid-19 quarantine/lockdown periods; stagnant/low wages and greater job tenure uncertainty which make working less attractive and more stressful; and the feeling by many of not wanting to work further for bad bosses or management who create bad work environments so that resignation becomes a means of escape from such conditions. This article analyses data of US labor trends since 2003 and demonstrates that resignations have been trending upward in the US aggregate economy and that quit rates mostly have been trending higher within many US industries. These phenomena can be explained by the concept of labor market segmentation, high unemployment, and underemployment rates that exist even in good economic times in some industries, minority group composition within industries, wage stagnation, and type of managerial supervision. Some of these same factors help to explain labor under-utilization greater than national/aggregate rates within these industries as well. © 2023 The Association for Social Economics.","Great Recession; Great Resignation; labor market segmentation; managers; underemployment; unemployment","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146288490"

A downturn caused by the coronavirus pandemic is expected to deepening inequalities, mainly due to the inability of households to repay existing debts or finance basic living needs. Understanding the determinants of household indebtedness and financial vulnerability is crucial for policymakers who process measures to prevent increasing household indebtedness. This paper investigates the determinants of household financial vulnerability in euro area countries using the Household Finance and Consumption Survey micro-dataset collected by the European Central Bank. The quantitative approach was applied using ordinary least square and quantile estimation procedures. The difference between OLS and quantile estimations showed the appropriateness of using the quantile regression approach. Performance analysis proved that only the number of elderly and the value of wealth and existence of mortgage interest tax relief statistically significant affects the level of vulnerability in all three waves. While the increasing number of elderly and greater value of household wealth lowers the vulnerability, the effect of mortgage interest tax relief differs across individual waves. All other used factors are essential and statistically significant for the financial vulnerability of households as well, but the importance and significance could differ across the distribution and individual waves. The effect of financial assets, education, and employment were found to be negative in all observations of all waves.

This paper examines the roles and characteristics of U.S. community banks in the past decade, covering the recent economic boom and downturn. We analyze risk characteristics of acquired community banks, compare pre- and post-acquisition performance, and investigate how the acquisitions have affected SBL. Contrary to the concerns, our analysis shows that the overall amount of SBL increases more after a merger when a community bank is acquired by a large bank. Data also suggest an overall (regardless of mergers) declining SBL trend for all bank size groups. In fact, the decline in the SBL ratio, on average, has been more severe among community banks, relative to large banks. Our results indicate that mergers involving community bank targets over the past decade have enhanced the overall safety and soundness of the banking system without adversely impacting SBL. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Bank mergers; Community banks; Small business lending","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84994893389"

Despite strength and pervasiveness of recent recessions, empirical results documenting the aggregate effect of economic downturns on urbanization and land-use change in Southern Europe are rather scarce. By considering a sequence of expansion and recession waves in Greece, our study verifies if land-use change differed in entity and spatial direction at two time intervals (2006–2012, 2012–2018) in the Athens’ metropolitan region. Different processes of urban transformation and landscape change were detected analysing Urban Atlas (1:10,000) change maps. The framework proposed in this study integrates a classical approach of landscape ecology grounded on the analysis of land-use metrics with a broader perspective linking regional science to spatial planning. To discriminate morphological from functional urbanization traits typical of expansions and recessions, our study performs a comparative analysis of seven trajectories of land-use change. Results identify a moderate expansion of residential settlements during 2006–2012, and a more evident growth of industrial settlements during 2012–2018. A significant increase in the number and size of forest patches converted to urban use was observed with recession, highlighting the increased vulnerability of relict natural sites with low economic value and high ecological potential. Crisis dynamics have stimulated an intensive use of fringe spaces for small residential settlements. By exalting local-scale specificities toward settlement densification and extensification on both greenfields and brownfields, economic downturns in metropolitan regions made land-use changes largely dependent on the background socioeconomic local context. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Economic crisis; Land management; Mediterranean Europe; Spatial principal component analysis; Urban governance","Greece; land use change; land use planning; Mediterranean environment; principal component analysis; spatial analysis; urban development; urbanization","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85115000508"

This paper uses panel data for Chinese listed companies from 2002 to 2016 to study the impact of Tobin’s Q and bargaining power on trade credit under different economic conditions, and we ultimately study how trade credit affects companies’ performance during economic fluctuations. We find that companies with higher Tobin’s Q values tend to reduce the use of trade credit demand, which increases during the economic expansion period and weakens during the economic downturn. Second, companies with lower bargaining power tend to increase their use of trade credit expansion as a competitive tool; however, this effect will weaken during the economic expansion period and will increase during the economic downturn. We also find that the amounts of trade credit demand and expansion are negatively correlated with corporate performance and that this effect weakens during the economic expansion period and increases during the economic downturn. The cycle of trade credit expansion is positively related to corporate performance. This relationship weakens during the economic expansion and strengthens during the economic downturn. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","bargaining power; corporate performance; economic fluctuations; Tobin’s Q; Trade credit","China; bargaining; corporate strategy; credit provision; econometrics; panel data; trade performance; trade relations","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85066913964"

However, the effects of contingent situations like drought episodes and economic crises, which may strongly restrict direct water use in households, remain less explored, and especially a combination of both. Catalonia, a Mediterranean region, suffered the worst drought episode in the last 75 years in 2007 and 2008, followed immediately by the worst economic crisis also in several decades between 2009 and 2014 (though still fishtailing). Taking it as a case study and using metered water data for the household sector, we propose a generalized linear mixed model in which the influence of both the drought episode and the economic crisis on per capita water consumption by comarques (supra-municipal entities) is assessed using a drought index on one hand, and economic variables and the water price on the other hand. Likewise, demographic, territorial and climatic determinants, as well as environmental behaviour, are also evaluated. The dataset (N = 287) consists of panel data for the forty-one comarques of Catalonia covering the 2007 to 2013 period. Results confirm that the contingent factors analysed have contributed to further reduce per capita water consumption, being significant the drought index and water price. The proportion of elderly people, the household size and the proxy for environmental behaviour, also have a negative effect on consumption; whereas seasonal population has the expected positive effect. However, neither the climatic and economic variables analysed, nor urban density and the proportion of foreign population, are found to be significant. A better understanding of the factors influencing residential water consumption in a context of growing water scarcity and economic downturn may aid policy makers and water managers not only to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of demand-side management measures that affect households, but to address emerging social concerns such as water poverty. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Catalonia; Drought; Economic crisis; Generalized linear mixed model; Households; Potable water consumption","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85028565474"

The empirical results support that the causality is nonlinear, bidirectional, and time- and country-varying, depending on each country’s FTI in each period. Under most FTIs, the current inbound tourism growth will crowd out the economic growth in the next period. When the FTI is higher than the threshold (81.27), the current economic growth will harm inbound tourism growth in the next period. For OECD countries with an FTI below the threshold (81.27), tourism companies should actively expand their investment to share the tourism dividend driven from the economic growth in the previous period. For OECD countries with an FTI above the threshold, the governments should adopt appropriate policies to reduce the impact of economic growth on the tourism industry, and tourism companies should increase tourism investment during the periods of economic downturn. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Economic growth; financial technology index; inbound tourism; panel smooth transition vector autoregressive model; time- and country-varying causality","economic growth; OECD; technological development; threshold; tourism economics","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85092351946"

The objective is to evaluate the performance of the model in the radically changed economy in the second half of the decade. The research hypothesis addresses whether the model is still usable and functional even almost a decade after the data occurred that determined its coefficients. This existing statistical model was a comprehensive multiple linear regression analysis for various categories of common types and sizes of equipment. Manufacturer, condition rating, and auction region are included as binary indicator variables. Statistically significant macroeconomic indicators can be used directly, but they provide new challenges as various governmental data series have been discontinued or modified, so that valid replacements must be found that range until the time of the economic crisis. Performing such a reanalysis faces technical challenges, including that several macroeconomic data series since the time of the original study have been discontinued or modified by their governmental sources. Moreover, new auction sales records mostly lack conditions and are devoid of locations. Various reconstructions are explored to still enable a valid reanalysis and, on validation, are used to augment the previous data series seamlessly with new data. Expert elicitation is used to select several equipment types that are likely to be affected by the recent economic downturn. The existing implementation tool is provided with the updated data for calculating forecasted residual values that are compared statistically with actual auction sales prices. Both practical and numerical problems are identified. The model consistently underestimates the actual values, indicating that they are less affected by the economic crisis or new variability is introduced from reconstructing its inputs. It is recommended that such model should be regularly updated, ideally by a professional organization. © 2011 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Construction equipment; Cost analysis; Data analysis; Economic factors; Regression analysis","Cost accounting; Data reduction; Linear regression; Machinery; Regression analysis; Statistics; Cost analysis; Data series; Economic condition; Economic crisis; Economic downturn; Economic factors; Expert elicitation; Indicator variables; Macroeconomic indicators; Market values; Multiple linear regression analysis; Numerical problems; Professional organization; Reanalysis; Residual value; Sales prices; Statistical models; Technical challenges; Updated data; Construction equipment","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-81855224831"

Because social capital enables collective action, the accumulation of social capital through development provides a basis for an expansion in the numbers of CPIs in a society. At the same time market expansion through development led globalization and labor migration weaken CPIs. Business cycles have similar influences. Economic booms weaken CPIs while subsequent economic downturns increase the likelihood that resource users will form CPIs.

This concern has been exacerbated and illuminated by the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper draws on reports from leading NGOs,activist groups and media sources,on commentary from high-profile water actors,and on emerging academic literature. In the process of these investigations,it uncovers a tendency to frame the water crisis primarily in terms of affordability; it also notes widespread concern over access and water quality issues. All of these are fundamentally related to equity principles. We argue here that seeing America’s water crisis as being about equity of access provides an opportunity to foreground the historic inequities revealed by the pandemic and by the subsequent economic downturn. A broader,intersectional approach can open-up the problem framing of water equity in the US to include histories of racism and colonialism. An intersectional approach allows for a more integrated and holistic analysis of the ways in which social difference shapes access,quality and affordability of water. Underlying power structures can be revealed through a better understanding of how water inequities result from broader patterns of systemic racism and colonial relations. Ultimately,this improved understanding can result in interventions that disrupt familiar patterns of inequality. As the idea of a water crisis in the US comes into the mainstream,the paper offers a point from which academics can begin to frame their research and a base from which practitioners can consider how to better achieve equity in water governance. © This Article Is Distributed Under The Terms Of The Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-Sharealike License Which Permits Any Non Commercial Use,Distribution,And Reproduction In Any Medium,Provided The Original Author(S) And Source Are Credited.

Economic downturns have increasingly influenced more recent waves of metropolitan growth, shaping differentiated patterns of urban change. While some cities evolved towards accelerated population dynamics in central districts responding to re-urbanisation impulses, other agglomerations were intrinsically bounded in a sort of ‘late suburbanisation’, with demographic shrinkage of both inner districts and rural areas, and uneven expansion of suburban population. By providing a comprehensive interpretation of the socioeconomic mechanisms underlying recent urban expansion, this study illustrates a diachronic analysis of population dynamics over multiple spatial scales and time frames in a metropolitan region of Southern Europe (Athens, Greece) between 1999 and 2019. Natural population balance was investigated vis à vis selected territorial indicators using descriptive, inferential and multivariate statistics. Results of the analysis identify different social forces underlying suburban population growth during economic expansion (2000s) and recession (2010s), evidencing a distinctive response of local communities to economic downturns that depends mostly on the background context (affluent versus disadvantaged neighbourhoods). Given the multiplicity of territorial dimensions involved in urban growth, our findings highlight how economic downturns distinctively shape metropolitan development based on locally differentiated demographic dynamics. © Urban Studies Journal Limited 2021.","multivariate statistics; natural population balance; Southern Europe; suburbanisation; urban governance","Greece; Southern Europe; governance approach; metropolitan area; population dynamics; population growth; shrinkage; urban planning; urbanization","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85113166411"

Resources allocated to investment in human capital, especially training and development, have been one of the first cuts in previous downturns. This reflects, at least in part, that training and development is often regarded as expenditure. Such cutbacks are likely to be detrimental to future competitive advantage, especially if there is a link between training and development and organisational performance. This study focuses on one aspect of training and development, management development (MD). A multi-faceted process model of MD - comprising eight inputs; two constructs of process and two constructs of output - is used to examine whether there is a link between MD and perceived subsidiary performance. The mediating effect of national context on any relationship between MD and perceived subsidiary performance is also explored. The potential implications of the global economic crisis for expenditure on MD and how such changes may affect future competitiveness are also considered. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","European firms; management development; perceived subsidiary performance; process study","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84860195406"

Against this backdrop, this study aims to examine the responsiveness of PHE to macro-fiscal determinants, demography, as well to private health insurance (PHI) financing. Design/methodology/approach: The authors gather annual panel data from four international organizations databases for the total of OECD countries from a period lasting from 2000 to 2017. The authors apply static and dynamic econometric methodology to deal with panel data and assess the impact of several parameters on PHE. Findings: The authors’ findings indicate that gross domestic product, fiscal capacity, tax revenues and population aging have a positive effect on PHE. Further, the authors find that both unemployment rate and voluntary private health insurance financing present a negative statistically significant impact on our estimated outcome variable. Different specifications and sample periods applied in the regression models reveal how inseparably associated are PHE and OECD's economies compliance on macro-fiscal policies for offsetting public finances derailment. Practical implications: Providing more evidence on the responsiveness of PHE to several macro-fiscal drivers, it can be a helpful tool for governments to reconsider their persistence on fiscal adjustments measures and rank public health financing to the top of their political agenda. Health systems policies for meeting Universal Health Coverage (UHC) objectives, they should also take into consideration the voluntary PHI institution, especially for economies with insufficient fiscal capacity to raise public health financing. Originality/value: To the best of knowledge, the impact of unemployment and voluntary PHI funding on public health financing, apart from other macro-fiscal and demographical parameters effect, remains unnoticed in the existing published studies on the topic. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Fiscal consolidation; Macroeconomy; Panel data econometric analysis; Public health expenditure; Unemployment; Voluntary private health insurance","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85086645067"

The empirical literature comparing community benefits provided by NFPs and their for-profit counterparts is mixed. However, NFPs are not a homogenous group and can include religious hospitals, community-owned hospitals, or academic medical centers. PURPOSE:: This longitudinal study examines how religious hospitals compare with other NFPs and for-profit hospitals with respect to providing community benefits and how the provision of community benefits by hospitals has changed over time. METHODOLOGY:: Using a pooled cross-sectional design, we examine two summated scores based on questions from the American Hospital Association annual survey that focus on community orientation among hospitals. We analyze two regressions with year, facility, and market controls to determine how religious hospitals compare with the other groups over time. FINDINGS:: Overall, 11% of U.S. hospitals are religious. Religious hospitals were more likely to engage in each individual community benefit activity examined. In addition, the mean values of community benefits provided by religious hospitals, as measured on two summated scores, were significantly higher than those provided by other hospital types in bivariate and regression analyses. Overall, community benefits provided by all hospitals increased over time and then leveled off during the start of the recent economic downturn. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS:: As the debate continues regarding federal tax exemption status, policymakers should consider religious hospitals separately from NFPs. Managers at religious hospitals should consider how their increased levels of community benefits are related to their missions and set benchmarks that recognize and communicate those achievements.

In turn, higher uncertainty increases the profit risk-premium when the economy operates close to the wage constraint, deepening a recession.

Second, against the backdrop of an industry downturn (2009–2013), this article demonstrates an advancing role of the central state in the industry. The authors thereby develop a nuanced perspective on the notions of recentralization and sectoral rebalancing.

Most planning scholars interested in resilience have paid little attention to examining the resilience of the housing market to economic shocks at the neighbourhood level across the USA. Using cluster analysis and hierarchical linear models, together with changes in housing prices, this study examines patterns and drivers explaining neighbourhood resilience within the context of metropolitan housing markets over periods of housing boom, bust, and recovery. Findings suggest that neighbourhood and metropolitan factors associated with housing market resilience varied across space and time: housing and mortgage market conditions affected neighbourhood recovery in the relatively short term while most urban form variables affected recovery over the long term. In addition, the associations and recovery patterns varied among the types of metropolitan areas, showing that neighbourhoods in strong markets had more drivers of resilience and reverted to their original status more quickly than those in weak markets, highlighting the growth of regional housing disparity during the housing recovery. Across the nation, however, home values in neighbourhoods that experienced more extreme periods of boom and bust underwent short-lived depreciation during the recession but long-term appreciation.

This article shifts the focus to primeage workers, exploring the relation between economic conditions, related labour market dynamics, and overeducation across 16 European countries in the aftermath of the 2008 economic crisis. We regard cross-sectional overeducation rates as the result of past labour market dynamics involving employers' hiring and dismissal decisions and employees' job mobility. Based on data from the 2011/2012 Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competences (PIAAC), we estimate mixed-effects linear-probability models. We find that overeducation risks are higher for individuals who experienced job mobility after the outbreak of the crisis (movers) than for those who were able to keep their jobs, with workers who changed their job before the crisis (short-Term stayers) experiencing higher overeducation risks than long-Term stayers. These differences are partly explained by compositional and contextual factors-however, our newly introduced differentiation of labour market dynamics profiles also shows an independent effect. Moreover, tertiary graduates are more likely to be overeducated than workers with upper-secondary qualifications-controlling for workers' skill heterogeneity. The findings on macroeconomic conditions are mixed: overeducation risks are higher in contexts of poorer economic conditions and even more so for movers; however, the multiplicative negative effect for movers disappears after controlling for job characteristics. This finding suggests that post-crisis mobility channeled workers more often into labour market segments with inferior job conditions where the risk of overeducation is generally higher. © The Author(s) 2018.

Despite the wealth of quantitative (micro–macro) information delineating short-term population dynamics in advanced economies, the contribution of economic downturns to local fertility has still been under-investigated along urban–rural gradients, especially in low-fertility contexts. Recent studies have assumed suburban fertility rates as systematically higher than urban and rural fertility rates. This assumption (hereafter known as the “suburban fertility hypothesis”) has been grounded on stylized facts and spatial regularities in advanced economies that reflect a significant role of both macro (contextual) and micro (behavioral) factors that positively influence fertility in suburban locations. To test the suburban fertility hypothesis at the macro-scale, the present study compares gross fertility rates from seven regional units of the Athens metropolitan area between 1991 and 2018. A refined spatial analysis of gross fertility rates during an economic expansion (1999–2008) and recession (2009–2018) was carried out in 115 urban, suburban, and rural municipalities of the same area. Experiencing sequential waves of economic expansion and recession, Athens’ sociodemographic dynamics were considered a sort of “quasi-experiment” for Southern Europe, linking late suburbanization with the multiple impacts of (rapid) economic downturns. Compared with both urban and rural locations, a higher fertility rate in suburban municipalities (15–20 km away from downtown Athens) was observed during the study period. However, a subtle distinction was observed during the economic expansion versus the recession. In the first period, the highest birth rates were recorded in industrial locations west of Athens, hosting economically disadvantaged communities with a relatively young population structure. With the recession, the highest fertility was associated with residential and service-specialized (wealthier) locations east of Athens, attracting resident population from neighboring areas, and better responding to crisis. The results of our study document how recent urban expansion and economic downturns have intrinsically shaped fertility dynamics, with implications for urban sustainability and social cohesion of metropolitan regions. © 2021 by the authors.

From the perspective of new Indian craft entrepreneurs, digital and innovative entrepreneurship is crucial to surviving the crisis. It will eventually encourage the development of the handmade goods market and the artisanal reconfiguration as a business. In this study, the qualitative method was used. For the creation of themes, Inductive content analysis (analytical, inductive technique) was used to interview fifty online handicraft business owners who rely on their craft talents for income. After the pandemic, two types of motivation were generated for handmade entrepreneurs. The first motivation was extrinsic, which conditioned the handicraft market, restricted mobility, and upgraded household status for entrepreneurship. The second was intrinsic motivation among the craft entrepreneurs who generated individual and professional skill growth. These two factors encouraged digital craft innovations and entrepreneurial advancement of transitioning handicraft companies to digital platforms. After the interview, respondents explained several hindrances or restrictions, market interruption, and quality internet. Even after that, it resolved as the effect of the pandemic reduced and digital skill training for innovation and entrepreneurship passion increased for developing a robust programme that supports the handicraft new entrepreneurs after the economic calamities. This finding contributes to the area of investigation and contributes to entrepreneurship literature. This study will open the route for making the policy and development of solid strategic plans for the handicraft sector’s new craft entrepreneurs. With the help of innovative and digital entrepreneurs, small-scale or craft industries will boost the Indian economy and give some of the best suggestions for global economies. For developing economies, this study will also empower entrepreneurs to open new dimensions for marketing, supply chain, and exportation and will finally increase the Globalisation of handmade products. © 2023, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Craft entrepreneur; Digital entrepreneurship; Digital innovation; Economic calamities; Handicraft artisans; ICT; Opportunity","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174165927"

However, excessive house price appreciations may distort capital allocation efficiency, for example by crowding out investments in productive sectors, which reduce long-term economic growth. Moreover, house price bubbles are typically unsustainable. Once a housing bubble bursts, credit conditions will tighten due to falling collateral value, leading to a fall in household consumption and employment that cause an economic downturn. Meanwhile, the correction of housing prices may improve investment efficiency and trigger structural reform that subsequently enhances economic growth. We look into the trade-off between the aforementioned effects at different stages of housing cycles and economic growth. Using a quarterly dataset that covers cross-country house prices over four decades, we find that house price appreciations are positively associated with economic growth, while the relationship between house price depreciations and economic growth is highly non-linear, depending on country-specific characteristics. In the absence of confounding crisis in the financial sector, short-lived large house price depreciations, rather than prolonged and modest ones, are positively associated with economic growth.

Many have seen huge losses to their 401(k)s. In numerous cases the value of homes the largest investment most older Americans have ever made has diminished considerably. In addition, large numbers of American workers, including those 50 and older, have lost their jobs and may have difficulty replacing them. Suddenly the future seems a whole lot less certain, throwing years of planning into doubt. In Reconsidering Retirement, economists Courtney Coile and Phillip Levine go beyond the headlines to explain how the economic crisis will affect the future plans and well-being of older Americans. Amid well-publicized reports that older workers needed to stay on the job because of the crisis, the number of U.S. workers claiming Social Security retirement benefits actually rose substantially from 2008 to 2009. The authors maintain that job loss has been the culprit, leading to premature retirement, and while this trend may have been less noticed, it is perhaps the more significant outcome of the crisis. Coile and Levine examine the three major characteristics of the recession thought to influence retirement behavior: decline in the stock market, reduced housing values, and a weak labor market. The authors find that lower home prices did not actually affect retirement behavior but that the decline in the stock market did lead some workers to delay retirement, while a weakened labor market actually forced more older workers with fewer skills into retirement. As a result, these early retirees, who rely on Social Security, face a lifetime of lower benefits. ""Workers affected by weak labor markets are more numerous than those affected by poor stock market returns, are more likely to have low socioeconomic status, and have a more substantially reduced income for the rest of their lives."" From the introduction ""Public discussion has focused on the effects of the stock market crash and has failed to recognize that most of the workers who are affected by stock losses come from the upper tail of the income distribution. Similarly, falling house prices have received considerable attention although they have had little impact on workers' retirement decisions. The most pressing problem older workers currently face is the labor market, which has received little attention."" From chapter 8 The legacy of recessions is that those most in need usually are last to reap the benefits of an economic recovery. While the lion's share of media coverage after the economic downturn of 200809 has gone to the plight of older workers who remain employed, Courtney Coile and Phillip Levine examine the effects of the economic crisis on all workers approaching retirement age. Some of their findings are counterintuitive and will surprise many analysts and readers. In particular, they shine a light on lesser-skilled workers forced into early retirement a number estimated at 378,000 workers. These workers will be forced into early involuntary retirement, drawing from Social Security sooner and receiving lower retirement income. This important book provides a complete picture of older workers today, how they will transition into retirement, and what we can do to assist them as the recession persists. show less.

These events were the unification of elite factions behind procedural democracy, post-1973 increases in state income from the international sale of petroleum, the late 1980s economic downturn and the armed forces' failure to gain widespread support for a military government following the initially popular coup attempt of 4 February 1992. The structural cleavages that orientated partisanship early in the democratic experience divided the poor from others, the Caracas-dominated center from the periphery, city-dwellers from rural residents, and locations in which traditional culture prevailed from those dominated by modern culture. The partisan-orientating impact of the first two structural cleavages declined after elite agreements and high international prices for petroleum provided resources that allowed the dominant Acción Democrática (AD - Democratic Action) and Partido Socialcristiano (COPEI - Social Christian Party) political parties to coopt multi-class support. The latter structural cleavages eroded in response to economic development and gradually lost their political relevance.

At the heart of this paper is an intriguing question of why educated middle-class workers would leave metropolises with high standards of living to work in a provincial city abroad where they perform routine tasks and earn less than they would in comparable positions back home. An analysis of in-depth interviews with Japanese service workers in China’s digital outsourcing industry focuses on their educational background and employment experience prior to migration. Based on my findings, I argue that relatively educated migrants use their diminishing middle-class resources to access an occupational niche abroad, in order to (temporarily) evade the increased risk of class slippage in the society of origin. Japan’s experience of a long-term economic slump since the early 1990s provides a fruitful point of comparison for studies that investigate changing youth transitions from education to employment and their relationship to migration patterns and class mobility in economically stagnant nations elsewhere. I critically engage with the literature on middling migration to highlight the usefulness of a historically sensitive and relational perspective from which to study middle-class migrants. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Japan; middle class migrants; middling migration; recession; Skilled migration; tertiary education","Japan; class; economic impact; educational attainment; international migration; labor migration; migrant worker; skilled labor","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85081724712"

We reviewed the media accounts of SME performance under the current economic downturn. We suggest that it may not be the credit crunch and the restriction of credit itself that has an impact on SME survival, but rather the consequences arising from the recession. The difficulties may lie with downturn in trade leading to reduction in cash flow and turnover, and this may be exacerbated by a slowdown in the rate of payments for all businesses. These aspects feed through to the higher risk premium that may be charged to SMEs.

Recognizing that trade in higher education services is becoming increasingly popular in Asia, and that higher education is an effective soft power tool, the HKSAR government has worked on developing itself as a regional education hub by making education services one of the new economic driving forces.

Now, there are new labor law reforms raising the rights and standards of workers throughout China. These new laws have been praised for their progressive measures and at the same time blamed for placing too many economic burdens on companies, especially those operating on the margins and those that have caused business failures. This, combined with the recent global downturn and the millions of displaced and unemployed Chinese migrant laborers, has created ongoing debate about the new labor laws. Meanwhile the Chinese Union has organized Wal-Mart and many of the Global Fortune 500 companies and a form of collective bargaining is occurring.

Evidence of such a contagion is revealed, and the contagion was possibly exacerbated by increasing imbalances in the Indonesian economy. The paper also examines the channels through which the economic difficulties of Thailand might have been transmitted to Indonesia.

IRGC was designed as a crisis recovery tool to jump start East German economy after reunification. Since 2001, the programme has continuously generated a moderate number of new firms, spin-offs from universities and enhanced employment as well as private investments in the politically induced clusters, which have also shown a relatively stable development even in the economic downturn of the recent financial crisis. As a new programmatic feature, the BMBF demands a well-grounded market-oriented strategy from the regional consortia aiming at developing innovative and economically successful products from science. The German innovation programme IRGC illustrates the shift in innovation policy from passive funder to active entrepreneur. Through this strategic approach, government plays an important role in inducing, encouraging and organizing knowledge-based economic development. We discuss how these policies can add to the viability and resilience of innovative clusters by encouraging them to build up management competences. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","","Germany; economic development; economic growth; employment; entrepreneur; financial crisis; innovation; investment; regional economy; strategic approach","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84866313393"

To describe Aggregate Demand Index (ADI) trends from 1999–2010; to compare ADI time trends to concurrent data for US unemployment levels, US entry-level pharmacy graduates, and US retail prescription growth rate; and to determine which variables were significant predictors of ADI. Methods. Annual ADI data (dependent variable) were analyzed against annual unemployment rates, annual number of pharmacy graduates, and annual prescription growth rate (independent variables). Results. ADI data trended toward lower demand levels for pharmacists since late 2006, paralleling the US economic downturn. National ADI data were most highly correlated with unemployment (p < 0.001), then graduates (p < 0.006), then prescription growth rate (p < 0.093). A hierarchical model with the 3 variables was significant (p = 0.019), but only unemployment was a significant ADI predictor. Unemployment and ADI also were significantly related at the regional, division, and state levels. Conclusions. The ADI is strongly linked to US unemployment rates. The relationship suggests that an improving economy might coincide with increased pharmacist demand. Predictable increases in future graduates and other factors support revisiting the modeling process as new data accumulate. © 2010 American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy","Aggregate Demand Index; employment; pharmacist shortage; pharmacy graduates; prescription drug growth; unemployment; workforce","Education, Pharmacy; Humans; Medically Underserved Area; Pharmacists; Students, Pharmacy; article; comparative study; education; health care planning; human; pharmacist; pharmacy student","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84857095046"

The study reveals that penetration is higher in Lagos at 81% and lower in Ekiti at 60%. Irregular income/job loss, unknown/hidden charges, long queues in the bank, and high maintenance fees constitute a top threat to 80% financial inclusion achieved in the Southwest zone. The study, therefore, recommends intervention policy that considers state-level characteristics. Also, government policy on employment generation should target low-income earners who are worse-off during an economic downturn. © 2020 The Author(s).

Actually this assumption receives little support from the historical record. For a century before 1930 fertility declined while the economy expanded and real incomes rose. Then for nearly three decades fertility and incomes fell and rose together. Since 1960 they have again moved in opposite directions. Clearly, no simple generalization about their relation will hold water. More sophisticated explanations are based on relative rather than absolute incomes. Banks suggested that the downturn in English fertility in the 1870‘s might have occurred because standards of middle-class consumption rose faster than middle-class incomes, but he found the evidence inconclusive. To reconcile the post-war baby boom in the United States with earlier experience, Easterlin has argued that fertility is determined by the relationship between the income of couples in their twenties and the income of their parents ten to fifteen years earlier. Among the weaknesses of this theory as applied to U.S. experience are its failure to explain the sharp drop in fertility, including that of native white urban women, in the 1920‘s; the fact that fertility rose most in the baby boom at the higher socio-economic levels where incomes rose least; and the sharp decline of fertility after 1962 in spite of the favourable trend of incomes, including those of younger people. The broad conclusion is that while couples no doubt do consider income, employment opportunities, etc. in deciding how many children to have, such considerations have had a relatively minor influence on changes in fertility, which for the most part have been the result of changes in attitudes. Even the post-war baby boom was a result not only of higher incomes and full employment but also of a shift in attitudes toward family size, particularly among the better-educated, economically better-off sections of society. © 1971 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0010185185"

This failure, we argue, stemmed from an incomplete understanding of the pivotal role of financial institutions in the amplification of the crisis and its transmission to the wider economy. Low global interest rates and a consequent 'search for yield' in the pre-crisis period encouraged financial institutions to build highly leveraged balance sheets which, in turn, generated extremely large asset-price movements when a 'small event'-the downturn in the US sub-prime mortgage market-triggered the worldwide crisis. The paper then briefly describes the element of the broadly successful and coordinated macroeconomic policy response to the crisis before turning to the medium-term challenges facing policy-makers in sustaining global recovery. At the national level, we focus on the resolution of fiscal imbalances which contributed, in part, to the crisis, and which then worsened because of the policy actions which have been taken to deal with it. At the international level, we emphasize the need to rectify the imbalances between savings and investment in many significant countries. This will require greater coordination of macroeconomic policy across the world's major economies. It will also involve strengthening the role, and the governance, of the International Monetary Fund. © The Authors 2009.

We argue that more left-leaning governments in the U.S. states have the same preference for and willingness to use government to reduce unemployment, but that the greater resource and policymaking constraints that the states face during economic downturns limit their ability to shape unemployment to economic growth periods. We find evidence for these arguments in an analysis of the U.S. states for the period of 1975–2010. Specifically, when economic growth is low, liberal state governments are associated with increases in unemployment rates similar to or even somewhat higher than conservative governments, but when growth is moderate to high, liberal state governments are associated with greater-than-expected reductions in unemployment. We also provide some evidence that different state spending decisions between liberal and conservative state governments may explain these patterns. © 2014, The Author(s)","Economic policy; Federalism; Fiscal policy; Parties and interest groups; Political economy; Political parties; Public policy; Public policy","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84927775327"

We take a rigorous econometric approach that exploits regional variation in unemployment and compares babies born to the same parents so as to deal with possible selective fertility based on labour market conditions. We find that downturns are beneficial; an increase in the unemployment rate during pregnancy reduces the probability of having a birth weight less than 1500 grams or of dying within 28 days of birth.

While there is a significant degree of diversity between these governments, their development agendas share the common goal of countering the neoliberal disembedding of markets and re-subordinating the economy to society through protective measures promoting social equality, democratization, greater national sovereignty, and regional integration. Within this broad objective, two main currents have emerged. On the one side, there have been attempts to re-engage with traditional problems of development, including economic growth, structural reform, state intervention, control of national resources, regional integration, and social inclusion; on the other side, a more radical sociopolitical project has attempted to develop a different path altogether for re-embedding the economy, one that separates development from its consumerist, materialist, and Western-centric associations of the past in favor of a new form of human development and societal transformation that has engaged with notions of democratic participation, indigenous rights, feminism, and radical ecology. However, over 15 years since its initial emergence, this social and political project appears to be reaching a new turning point characterized by economic decline and political disintegration. In this article, we take the opportunity to assess the efforts that have been made in the search for a new development model. We argue that while significant strides have been taken in the direction of counteracting neoliberal disembedding, the recent downturn has unveiled the cracks and tensions in the attempt to achieve more profound economic and societal transformations for re-embedding the economy. © 2016, © 2016 SAGE Publications.","21st century socialism; critical development studies; Latin America; Latin American social movements; pink tide","Latin America; critical analysis; developing world; economic growth; feminism; human rights; indigenous population; political discourse; social movement; socialism; sovereignty; twenty first century","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85009773834"

Even though Switzerland experienced milder effects compared to its European neighbours, the Swiss unemployment rate increased considerably compared to its status quo. This paper explores the resilience of vulnerable groups to these economic downturns using both objective (income poverty and material deprivation) and subjective (wellbeing and satisfaction with the financial situation) indicators of quality of life. To analyse how quality of life evolved since the early 2000s, we use a longitudinal database: the Swiss Household Panel. Studying both objective and subjective indicators, results suggest that the dot-com crisis had a stronger negative effect than the Great Recession on vulnerable groups. This was particularly true for single parents and large families. Disadvantaged groups during the first crisis reacted in different ways during the second crisis. Some groups (the unemployed, the low-educated and the solo self-employed) experienced some scarring effects sometimes only according to objective indicators; others were resilient and continued with their normal trends (migrants and the young), whereas the most strongly affected groups during the first crisis (single parents and large families) registered an improvement in their conditions in the second crisis. These results point to a combination of subjective and objective indicators to evaluate the effects of recurrent crises on vulnerable groups. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","Economic crises; Indicators; Poverty; Resilience; Subjective wellbeing; Vulnerability","Switzerland; financial crisis; poverty; quality of life; socioeconomic indicator; trend analysis; unemployment; vulnerability","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85049601836"

In this study, we approximate financial stress by agricultural loan delinquency, and predict it by employing a logistic regression and several machine learning methods. The main datasets include the Call Reports and Summary of Deposits from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Our results show that ensemble learning methods have the best performance in prediction accuracy, with improvement of 26 percentage points at most and that the Naïve Bayes classifier is the best method to maintain the lowest cost from false predictions when the failure of identifying potentially high-risk loans is very costly.

Equally important were the severity of the downturn in GDP growth in 2007-11 and the level of democracy. The results offer some evidence for the 'inverse J-curve' hypothesis whereby an economic boom period followed by a downturn is conducive to protest.

Methods We reviewed employment figures, mortality rates, occupational burden of disease and injuries, reported accidents, surveys on self-reported occupational illnesses and injuries, attributable fractions, and the most recent information on the problems from published papers, documents, and electronic data sources of international organizations, European institutions/agencies, and public websites. We identified and analyzed programs and strategies to reduce the work-related negative outcomes at various levels. Results Work-related illnesses that have a long latency period and are linked to ageing are clearly on the increase, while the number of occupational accidents has gone down in industrialized countries thanks to prevention and structural changes. We have estimated that globally there are 2.3 million deaths annually for reasons attributed to work. We refer to prevention methods as a ""toolbox"" and categorize the following as ""individual tools"": legislation and enforcement, information on the existing state of problems and capacities (profile), knowledge of solutions and good practices, communication and promotion to increase awareness, and collaboration and networking for exchange of good practice. Global, regional, national, and sectoral strategies and systems cover these issues, reflecting their respective priorities. Conclusion In the present political situation and serious economic downturn, legal measures need to be supplemented with economic justification and convincing arguments to reduce corner-cutting and avoid long-term disabilities, premature retirement, and corporate closures due to a poor work environment.","Indicator; Management system; Mortality estimate; Occupational safety and health; OSH; Policy; Program; Work-related accident; Work-related disease","Europe; health and safety; health services; injury; international organization; management practice; mortality; occupational exposure; structural change; aging; article; awareness; employment; Europe; health survey; human; industrialization; interpersonal communication; law enforcement; management; mortality; occupational accident; occupational disease; occupational health; occupational safety; priority journal; program development; risk assessment; strategic planning; teamwork; trend study; work environment","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-77950854858"

The unique panel data is from 2007 to 2009, incidentally before and after the crisis hit, and was collected as a postal survey by The Directorate of Health. We specifically explore four outcomes: Frequency of any alcohol consumption, frequency of binge drinking, binge drinking participation and alcohol dependence, using pooled OLS and linear probability models. We find that women tend to decrease their frequency of any alcohol consumption and frequency of binge drinking more than men between waves but men show a stronger negative response to the crisis in binge drinking participation and alcohol dependence. Changes in individual income explain most of men’s reduction in drinking, but women’s drinking responses are not operating through labor-market mechanisms to the same extent. Other factors in the demand function for alcohol that changed during the crisis seem to play a greater role, most notably the real price of alcohol, which increased considerably following the economic collapse. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Alcohol consumption; Drinking frequency; Economic collapse; Iceland; Income; Work hours","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84947032345"

Utilizing the same protocol as the original study in 2006–2007, two follow-up field experiments took place in 2013–2014 and 2018–2019. The study estimated that gay men experienced occupational access constraints and wage sorting in vacancies offering lower remuneration. It was found that in 2013–2014 and 2018–2019, gay men experienced increasingly biased treatment compared to 2006–2007. Moreover, the results suggested that monthly unemployment bore an association with occupational access constraints and wage sorting in vacancies offering lower remuneration for gay men. In each of the three experiments, this study captured recruiters’ attitudes toward gay men. A one standard deviation increase in taste-discrimination attitudes against gay men decreased their access to occupations by 9.6%. Furthermore, a one standard deviation increase in statistical-discrimination attitudes against gay men decreased their access to occupations by 8.1%. According to the findings, in 2013–2014 and 2018–2019, firms excluding gay applicants expressed a higher level of taste- and statistical-discrimination attitudes compared to 2006–2007. A gay rights backlash due to the LGBTIQ+ group’s attempt to advance its agenda, rising far-right rhetoric, and prejudice associated with economic downturns experienced in Greece might correspond with increasing biases against gay men.

A central factor shaping the viability of small retailers is the development of big box chain stores that offer one-stop shopping and price out smaller competitors. Although prior studies have considered the transition from small to large retailers as a national phenomenon, arguing for the importance of place effects, we document the spatial variation in this process for nonmetropolitan counties in the United States. We hypothesize that the economic downturns in agriculture and manufacturing during the 1980s, combined with suburban sprawl into nonmetropolitan counties, facilitated the decline of small retailing in specific locales. Employing data from the 1977-1996 U.S. County Business Patterns, we test our hypotheses concerning the spatial variability in the decline of small retailing. Our results point to a marked decline in the number of establishments and employment in selected retail industries for nonmetropolitan counties near metropolitan areas in the South, Midwest, and West. These findings highlight the importance of considering local business enterprises as an important dimension of public life and local leadership in community affairs. We conclude our study by outlining the social consequences of the decline of small retail activity and suggest directions for future research. © 2003 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-26444562375"

But the 1996 law introduced another important but far less broadly noted policy change: it restricted legal immigrants' access to cash-transfer programs such as welfare as well as to other social safety net programs such as food stamps and health insurance. It gave states new powers to deny benefits to noncitizen immigrants, and it codified comprehensively for the first time the eligibility of legal immigrants, unauthorized immigrants, and refugees for federal and state public benefits. These restrictions were driven by a widely held belief that immigrants were drawn to the United States and the states in which they settled by welfare's magnetic force. The provisions were intended to promote immigrant self-sufficiency and serve the immigration policy goal of improving the ""quality"" of the immigrants admitted. Not insignificantly, the provisions restricting noncitizens' eligibility for benefits were expected to generate 44 percent of the $54 billion in welfare reform's projected savings during its first six years of implementation (Congressional Budget Office 1996). It could be argued that the law superimposed welfare reform's larger goals-promoting work and marriage and reducing welfare use-on a population generally characterized by comparatively low welfare use, high work levels, and a significantly greater likelihood of living in intact families than the native-born poor. By restricting eligibility for noncitizens and thereby making citizenship a pathway to benefits, it changed both the incentives to naturalize and the value of citizenship. A companion law, the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA), also passed in September 1996. The IIRIRA required that sponsors' incomes be included in benefit-eligibility calculations, allowing states to hold sponsors liable for the value of any benefits that sponsored immigrants received (Public Law 104-207). Further, by granting states new authority to discriminate against or support noncitizens, the law foreshadowed the devolution of both immigrant-integration and immigration-enforcement policies to state and local governments. This trend accelerated following the defeat of comprehensive immigration reform legislation in 2006 and 2007. A central focus of this volume, then, is welfare reform's immigrant provisions, their origins and purposes, what we know about their impacts, and their implications for policy. These chapters explore major trends in immigrants' use of public benefits, the controversies to which these trends have given rise, the myths that have sometimes dominated public discourse, and some of the policy alternatives to curbing benefits that have been proposed in the past and that might find voice in the future. The chapters were initially presented as papers at a conference held in December 2006, PRWORA's tenth anniversary year, at the Migration Policy Institute. The conference and this volume have been supported by the Russell Sage Foundation, with additional support from the Annie E. Casey Foundation and the Foundation for Child Development. These chapters address a number of frequently contested issues that shaped the debates surrounding welfare reform's passage in 1996 and that continue to shape social welfare and immigration debates today. The central theme that unifies the book and informs these questions is the impact of welfare reform on the integration of immigrants and their children, both as the laws' framers intended and as unfolded after the law was implemented: Do public benefits serve as magnets that attract immigrants to the United States or to particular states within the country? Do benefits promote dependency within the immigrant population? Do they provide a disincentive to work? Do immigrants have a greater propensity to use benefits than the native-born poor? Do benefits promote a form of negative acculturation that rises with the length of time immigrants remain in the United States? Does use of benefits slow integration? Are the policy imperatives that drove welfare reform-the need to promote work and marriage within the poverty population- As pertinent to immigrants as to natives? We also discuss some of the issues that have emerged in the wake of the law: Have state substitution programs and federal restorations of eligibility for some groups of noncitizens effectively returned noncitizen eligibility policies to the status quo before the law passed? Has the law had, and does it continue to have, unintended effects on populations that were theoretically protected, specifically refugees and citizen children with noncitizen parents? Did reform have a chilling effect on benefits use by eligible immigrants and their family members, and do those effects persist? Are the restrictions on noncitizens' eligibility for benefits driving a surge in naturalization, and thereby a decline in the quality of the naturalizing population? Can welfare reform be linked to patterns of hardship among immigrants? Has the intent of Congress been met regarding the roles that sponsors should play in supporting immigrants? The trends in law, policy, poverty, and benefits use presented here are of much more than historical interest. Although welfare reform and the dramatic changes it enacted in citizenship, benefits, federalism, and immigrant-integration policy may now be over a decade old, many of the law's most far-reaching restrictions stand as originally enacted, barring many legal immigrants from safety-net services during a severe economic downturn. Further, it could be argued that the law's restrictions on legal immigrants' access to the social safety net reflect a broader neglect of immigrant-integration policy at the federal level, despite the nation's comparatively generous admission policies.1 That is, although the United States annually admits more immigrants on a citizenship track than any other country in the world, its integration policies-especially those at the federal level-remain ad hoc and underfunded. One result is that the burden of financing immigrant integration has been shifted to an increasingly restive set of state and local governments. Restrictions on federally funded benefits for immigrants that shift safety net costs to the state and local level are one such burden. The impacts of the mismatch between generous immigration rules and poorly defined integration policies are of growing significance given the rapid rise in the nation's immigrant population, which effectively doubled between 1990 and 2006. The significance is likely to increase when the economy recovers and the nation begins to experience shortages of native-born workers as the baby boomers retire.

As productivity is the determinant factor for long-term economic growth and the PRC watches soaring labor cost while no serious unemployment recently, this article tries to understand its slowdown from the supply side. Based on provincial panel data, it first identifies the determinants of productivity growth and then uses counterfactual analysis to simulate effects of the PRC's policy-induced investment boom on its economic growth. It finds that economic openness enhances productivity, whereas economies at higher stages of development on average have lower productivity growth. Second, productivity of economies accumulating more stock of inventory grows more slowly, while the opposite is observed for those with higher labor involvement rates. Third, government size and investment rate both have significantly negative effects on productivity growth. Finally, the diminishing late-mover advantage and the growth in investment rate are both major contributors to the current decline in the PRC's productivity growth. The current economic slowdown does not seem to be a cyclical downturn. Indeed, further reforms are needed to stabilize the PRC's growth. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","allocative efficiency; counterfactual analysis; Productivity; technical efficiency; utilization efficiency","China; economic growth; productivity; technical efficiency","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85004011519"

The problems manifest in European peripheral countries that are also members of the Eurozone, that is, Ireland, Spain, and Greece, have roots in domestic policy mistakes. However, the European context of these policy profiles also needs to be taken into account. The creation of the Euro initially yielded large credibility gains for the weaker economies, extending low interest rates across the Eurozone. But it also introduced a set of perverse incentives toward fiscal expansion which were -supposed to be managed at domestic level. Weak European coordinating capacity meant there were few effective external disciplines on national decision making. The sanctions built into the Stability and Growth Pact proved more controversial and, therefore, less constraining than originally envisaged. The problems accumulating in the weaker economies made them particularly exposed to crisis when the downturn came. The crisis is not merely one of peripheral economies' policy errors, but extends to the design of European decision making and the management of monetary union, and to the underlying structural differences in relative trade capabilities between Eurozone member states. These issues are explored with reference to the Irish case: the crisis of the Irish and other peripheral economies points to a number of unresolved difficulties at the heart of European politics.","","Greece; Ireland; Spain; crisis management; economic impact; economic policy; fiscal policy; interest rate; monetary union","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-78650398702"

As the debt crisis and coronavirus crisis show, despite their importance, they are extremely sensitive to economic downturns. Therefore, SMEs need to be supported through various tools. The paper is aimed at evaluating the SMEs' bank and governmental support in the northern and southern EU countries in two crisis periods and assessing the financial state of SMEs on the eve of coronacrisis using micro-level data. It was proved that bank loans and credit lines remain the main sources of SMEs' financing. After the debt crisis, banks are becoming more loyal to SMEs. It was proved that SMEs from the northern EU countries suffered less from the previous crisis and therefore started their recovery earlier than the southern ones in terms of profitability, liquidity and debt burden. In addition, it was shown that both groups on the eve of the new turbulence period were in better financial state compared to the previous debt crisis. The southern EU countries suffered more from both crises. At the same time, due to effective governmental support and bank loyalty, their SMEs entered the coronacrisis at the same level of financial stability as the northern ones. Since the new support measures are concentrated primarily in the banking sector through loan guarantee schemes and reduced interest rates, it is essential to provide debt financing to highquality borrowers and avoid the debt crisis in southern counties. © The author(s) 2020.","Bank loans; COVID-19; Credit lines; Debt crisis; Financial indicators; SMEs","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85091817846"

This research integrates both an objective measure of the recession based on negative personal experiences, as well as subjective event-based appraisals of how the recession impacted people's lives. Method: Drawing on longitudinal data from the National Survey of Midlife Development in the United States, linear lagged dependent variable models are used to estimate associations between recession-era stressors and chronic pain interference among 1113 adults. The analysis further examines the moderating influences of anticipated stressor duration and pre-recession financial optimism. Results: Findings reveal that both an accumulation of adverse experiences and global appraisals of the economic recession have harmful associations with chronic pain interference; however, their magnitude varied according to future-oriented moderating factors. Specifically, people with high pre-recession financial optimism fared better when confronted with recession-related stressors than did those with low levels of financial optimism. Moreover, pain interference was greater among individuals who appraised the recession as having a negative impact on their lives, but only if they perceived the recession would extend into the future. Conclusions: This study demonstrates distinctive links between two recession-related measures and pain interference. Findings suggest that positive future orientations can be protective during an economic crisis, whereas negative orientations heighten the pain. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Appraisals; Economic recession; Pain; Stress process","Adult; Economic Recession; Humans; Mental Health; Pain; United States; United States; cognition; economic theory; financial crisis; numerical model; research work; adult; aged; anticipation; Article; attitude; chronic pain; conceptual framework; controlled study; demography; disease association; economic recession; female; financial management; futurology; health hazard; human; male; personal experience; prediction; sensitivity analysis; stress; United States; mental health; pain","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85075860268"

The paper focuses on the application and desired effects of green digital technologies in the electric power industry in ten countries — the largest electricity producers and consumers. The study in designed in the frame of the sectoral innovation systems concept. The research tasks were addressed, first, through horizon scanning (the analysis of research and analytical publica-tions). Second, green digitalization indicators for the electric power industry in the selected countries were identified with the use of statistical and other available reliable data and compared. Third, a comparative analysis of national strategic documents was performed, along with corporate tasks and indicators that reflect digital transformation at mi-cro level. As a result of the study key trends and three models of green digitalization at national level were identified, the prerequisites and potential social and economic effects of these technologies application in electric power industry. © 2021 by the authors.","Digital technologies; Economic recovery; Energy industry; Green technologies; Internet of Energy; Smart grid; Sustainable development","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85116368063"

This increase was underpinned by the regime of free movement of people within the European Union, which has helped transform Europe into the lead destination of Portuguese emigration. The effects of the 2008 financial crisis on this migratory dynamic have proven complex. In the first instance, the fact that this crisis was global prompted a downturn in emigration. However, in a second phase, there was new and very marked growth in the rate of Portuguese emigration coupled with changes to the hierarchy of destinations. The greatest of these alterations was the abrupt decline in the numbers departing for Spain, which was overtaken by the United Kingdom as the main destination for emigration. From a comparative perspective, the joint effects of the growth in emigration and the stagnation of immigration mean that Portugal is today among the least attractive countries in EU. As a consequence, international migratory patterns in Portugal today – as in the 1960s – are exacerbating rather than countering the population decline in the country with the lowest fertility rate in Europe. © The Author(s) 2019.","Crisis and migration; European intra-migration; Portuguese emigration","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85101587896"

Construction companies are not immune to economic downturns, as evidenced by the sharp decline and long recovery period associated with the Great Recession of 2007-2009. Therefore, construction companies and construction industry stakeholders need to infuse specific economic strategies into their business operations. To determine effective strategies for construction companies to consider for weathering the risks associated with economic downturns, a Delphi study methodology was employed. Three rounds were conducted with qualified construction economic and financial experts representing financial officers, certified public accountants, and sureties to collect and confirm the existence and effectiveness of economic strategies employed by construction firms during economic downturns and recessions. From the Delphi study, 40 strategies were confirmed as highly or moderately effective methods based on the consensus criteria established from the Delphi study across six categories (1) organizational and project management, (2) direct-cost, (3) overhead, (4) financial, (5) preconstruction and marketing, and (6) efficiency strategies.

Drawing on fieldwork in both countries, three main findings were identified. First, due to the events in Ukraine, the Ukrainian diaspora has mobilised, grown stronger and became more united, whilst transforming from a more inward-looking to a more outward-looking community which, as a result, is now more and critically engaging with Ukrainian affairs. Second, the Ukrainian diaspora has the willingness, power and resources to contribute to the development of the home country, claiming to be recognised as an important stakeholder in the development of Ukraine. Thirdly, the Ukrainian government's lack of recognition of the contribution of the Ukrainian diaspora is one of the most significant barriers to more comprehensive diaspora involvement in development.  © 2019 The Author(s).","development; Euromaidan; Poland; the UK; Ukrainian diaspora","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85101633498"

The economic impacts of Hurricane Ike (September 2008) endured long beyond the storm's landfall, compounded by a national recession. This study analyses the pattern of post-Ike industrial growth in eight coastal counties of Texas, United States, and identifies sources of resilience and potential drivers of recovery. The results indicate that post-disaster growth patterns differ from established growth patterns. Levels of resilience vary across industrial sectors, and service sectors tend to lead a recovery. The resilience of the hotel and restaurant sector, for instance, suggests that the presence of relief workers might immunise certain sectors against a post-disaster economic downturn. Besides the sectors that are generally resilient, each county has its own distinct sectors that, depending on the extent of the damage suffered, tend to perform strongly after a disaster, owing to the characteristics of the respective county's economy. © Overseas Development Institute, 2015.","Disaster resilience; Economic recovery; Economic resilience; Post-disaster growth; Resilience index","Cyclonic Storms; Disasters; Economic Recession; Humans; Industry; Models, Econometric; Relief Work; Restaurants; Texas; Texas; United States; disaster management; economic development; economic growth; economic impact; Hurricane Ike 2008; natural disaster; storm damage; catering service; disaster; economic recession; economics; human; hurricane; industry; relief work; statistical model; United States","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84930374589"

Based on an international sample of MFIs extracted from the MIX database over the 2001–2014 period, we uncover a negative relationship between MFIs' provisioning and the business cycle. Our finding corroborates the fact that MFIs do not build their loan loss provisions (LLP) during economic booms when profit and earnings are high. Since they provision more during downturns, they are more likely to suffer from unexpected losses and experience failure. This is in sharp contrast with the current Basel III countercyclical buffer requirement suggesting that financial institutions, especially banks, should build sufficient buffer in booms so that they can avoid costly capital adjustment when the economy contracts. Deeper analyses suggest however that this behaviour mainly concerns profit-oriented and deposit-taking/regulated MFIs, with business model and target close to conventional banking. This suggests that bank-like and regulated MFIs' loan loss provisions follow similar behavioral patterns to those of the conventional banking sector during the boom-and-bust cycles. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Business cycle; Credit cycle; Loan loss provisions; MFI; Microfinance","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85109463043"

Methods: Using propensity score matching and difference in differences methods, this study established a natural experimental design to compare before-and-after value changes of single-family (SF) homes in walkable neighborhoods with unwalkable neighborhoods during the Great Recession. Two thousand seven hundred ninety-nine SF homes within 18 Tax Increment Financing (TIF) districts were categorized into walkable (Walk Score ≥50) and unwalkable (<50) groups. Six hundred twenty-four dwellings in walkable neighborhoods were matched with the most identical ones in the unwalkable neighborhoods by controlling for the selected structural and residential location variables. Relative average treatment effects were examined for SF values in walkable and unwalkable neighborhoods. Results: On average, the SF homes in walkable neighborhoods held $4566 (2.08%) more value than their how walkable counterparts. Conclusions: This study aims to help planners and decision-makers by documenting the unmet demand for walkable communities and their sustained economic benefit. Increased awareness of the sustained value of walkable communities can be used by lenders who finance and by policy makers who regulate placemaking. Results from this study can be integrated with research that demonstrates health-care cost savings of walkable environments to create an even more comprehensive set of evidence-based interventions to increase their supply. © The Author(s) 2018.","built environment; economic benefit; great recession; natural experimental design; neighborhood retrofitting; propensity score matching; property value; walkability","Economic Recession; Environment Design; Female; Housing; Humans; Male; Residence Characteristics; Socioeconomic Factors; Texas; Walking; article; awareness; experimental design; finance; financial management; health care cost; housing; human; market; neighborhood; propensity score; Texas; demography; economic recession; economics; environmental planning; female; housing; male; socioeconomics; walking","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85055159518"

We find that the pronounced post-crisis slump in Italy and Spain was mainly driven by positive saving shocks (‘deleveraging’) and by an increase in investment and intra-euro risk premia. Fiscal austerity in Spain and the productivity slowdown in Italy have been additional sizable contributors to the economic downturn. The results further suggest that euro depreciation, heightened intra-euro risk premia and subdued investment had a sizable impact on the trade balance reversals in Italy and Spain, which has been offset in France by a strong increase in imports and lower exports. © 2019 The Authors","Cross-country comparison; EMU; Estimated DSGE; Post-crisis dynamics; Trade balance","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85068762780"

An infectious disease spreads across the network of agents' social and economic contacts and feeds back on the economic dimension of the model through various channels such as employment and consumption demand. Under a lockdown (LD) scenario, the model is able to closely reproduce the epidemiological dynamics of the first wave of the Covid-19 epidemic in the Lombardy region of Italy. We find that, in the presence of non-pharmaceutical interventions, there is no trade-off between lives and macroeconomic losses as a stricter LD eventually leads to superior outcomes along both dimensions. We also evaluate the efficacy of various macroeconomic stabilization policies designed to counteract the downturn generated by the epidemic and LD measures. In an agent-based setting we gain additional insights on the way in which such policies impact not only on gross domestic product but also, for instance, on firms' defaults and relative prices. Liquidity support for firms, a short-time working scheme with compensation for workers, and direct transfer to households stand out as the most effective policy tools. © 2022 The Author(s) 2022.

In this study, we estimate an econometric model of residential electricity demand and test the existence of a stable long-run relationship for the period 1980–2016, while accounting for the relief measures set out by the HK government since 2008. Empirical results suggest that there exists a long-run relationship among residential electricity consumption, electricity price, income per capita, and weather variables (temperature or cooling degree days). In the absence of electricity charge subsidies, the demand is found to be both price and income inelastic. On the other hand, HK's residential electricity consumers are unresponsive to price and income changes when electricity subsidies are in place. Following its new carbon reduction plan, HK is gradually phasing out coal for electricity generation to replace it mainly with natural gas. Our results suggest that new residential electricity charge subsidies can lessen the effectiveness of climate policies aimed at reducing electricity consumption through increases in the electricity price. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Cointegration analysis; Electricity charge subsidies; Price and income elasticities; Residential electricity","China; Hong Kong; Economic analysis; Electric power utilization; Cooling (heating) degree day; Economic downturn; Electricity generation; Electricity prices; Electricity-consumption; Residential electricity; Residential electricity consumption; Residential Electricity demands; demand analysis; electricity generation; empirical analysis; energy planning; estimation method; natural gas; residential energy; subsidy system; Housing","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85085060620"

The United Kingdom officially entered a recession in January 2009 that made public spending cuts inevitable. Academic libraries are particularly vulnerable to changes in the world economy because of their reliance on highly-priced globally-sourced information products and dependence on expenditure allocations from parent institutions that are heavily dependent on public funding. An investigation of initial and anticipated effects of the downturn on libraries in UK higher education was conducted in summer 2009 to assess its impact on human resources and working practices, information resources and collection management, service portfolios, projects, and developments. A pragmatic mixed methodology was employed combining a mainly quantitative sectorwide questionnaire survey (n = 36) with in-depth semi-structured interviews of 12 senior managers at five universities.

Drawing on Complexity Thinking (CT), this article emphasizes the radical relationality of global life, which contests the Eurocentrism and anthropocentrism of International Relations (IR). The proposition is that the fundamental rift in IR’s inquiry is not merely about the divide between the domestic (inside) and the international (outside) as mainstream orthodoxies aver, but about the very context (around) in which such schisms are located and performed. The relational ethics of such a “complexified” outlook critique the atomistic individualism dominating IR and reimagine the international as a dynamic space for dialogical learning, which promises a world that is less hegemonic, more democratic, and equitable. © 2020 University of Kent.","anthropocentrism; Complexity thinking; eurocentrism; relational ethics; relationality","ethics; individualism; international relations","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85082473104"

However, few such studies used sample periods including a recession as severe as the one that occurred in 2007-2009 or a period following the Congressional mandate requiring states to adopt immediate wage withholding for all child support orders established after January 1992. While virtually assuring compliance by steadily employed nonresident fathers, this requirement imposes hardships on unemployed nonresident fathers, especially during recessions, because modifying child support orders is costly, difficult, and uncertain. Using the CPS-CSS, this study provides reduced form estimates of the association between unemployment and child support compliance over a period (1993-2011) with severe business cycle fluctuations and immediate wage withholding in full effect. Despite controls for fixed effects (state and year) and a state-specific linear time trend, we found that local unemployment rates were associated with decreases in some measures of compliance in our full sample. In models using non-pass through child support payments, which minimized measurement error due to misreporting, there was a much more consistent relationship between unemployment and compliance. Further, after restricting the sample to cash assistance recipients to avoid bias due to selection into the child support enforcement system, we found that local unemployment rates were consistently, strongly, and negatively associated with compliance. Given the volatility in unemployment rates during recent recessions and in the Great Recession in particular, these findings suggest the potential for a large-scale impact of macro-economic factors on the consistent provisions of child support. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Child support; Child support compliance; Economic downturns; Non-custodial fathers; Unemployment","child; human; human tissue; measurement error; model; recipient; unemployment","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84963717495"

It was determined that low level of profitability of investment activity (for the analyzed period – 2008-2015) was the main reason for slow development of the system of non-state social insurance in Ukraine. 75.94% of private pension funds had positive mid-year nominal income, 26.3% of which had nominal income at the level of 10-20% and only 10.6% – more than 20%.

This study extends the literature on the geography of SNAP receipt by (1) examining change in SNAP receipt across US counties during the Great Recession and (2) identifying how changes in other local characteristics were associated with this outcome. Our analysis draws on data from the US Department of Agriculture and other secondary sources. We use descriptive statistics, mapping, and weighted least squares spatial regression models to examine county-level variation (N = 2,485) in the percentage-point change in SNAP receipt between 2007 and 2009. Our findings reveal substantial local-level variation in the change in SNAP stamp use during the downturn. We find that counties with the greatest levels of change in SNAP participation tend to be regionally clustered. Our regression analysis shows that areas where the signature characteristics of the Great Recession were most pronounced (i.e., home foreclosures and unemployment) were precisely the places where SNAP use jumped most, not places with historically high levels of SNAP participation. Overall, this study demonstrates that change in SNAP receipt was geographically uneven during the Great Recession, and that local and regional configurations matter in shaping this variation. These results hold a range of implications for public policy, including opportunities for regionally targeted outreach and investment in SNAP and the use of the program as a responsive form of local stimulus during periods of economic crisis. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Food stamps; Great Recession; SNAP; Spatial inequality","United States; least squares method; mapping; nutrition; regression analysis; welfare provision","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84891839684"

In 2008, Spanish hotels were jeopardized when the travelers’ flows became stagnated, in either domestic and foreign markets. Most of them overcame the crisis, but not all, in part depending on their capital structure at the moment the downturn loomed upon them. This study analyzes the financial ratios registered in 2008 by 3.341 Spanish lodging enterprises, to find out the most relevant ratios that were associated with an eventual breakdown. The analyzed ratios have been largely suggested by previous literature for anticipating financial distress; however, using survival tables and Kaplan–Meier estimates we could also find new insights about several promising variates for future research. In the end, by performing a Cox regression, we could isolate the return on capital employed (ROCE) ratio as a long-term predictor for small hotels’ bankruptcy after a market downturn. Moreover, the legal status seems to be a key predictor concerning medium-sized hotels. © 2021 by the authors.

However, during economic downturns, the relationship shifts and shows that international diversification is positively associated with the propensity of firms to save cash out of their cash flows. The negative relationship between international diversification and the propensity of firms to save cash out of their cash flows suggests that risk-reducing effects coupled with easy access to external finance prevail over the high agency costs and information asymmetry associated with international companies.

A simple theoretical model illustrates these channels. Estimates of the increases in borrowing, scaled by multipliers similar to those applied to traditional government spending and tax policies, suggest that the programs provided a fiscal stimulus of roughly $344 billion, similar to what was provided by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 Although there is considerable uncertainty about this point estimate, its size suggests the importance of taking the stimulus and automatic stabilizer effects of federal credit programs into account, particularly during economic downturns that are accompanied by severe financial market distress. However, though credit programs are shown to be a relatively low-cost source of fiscal stimulus, to assess their overall welfare implications, these benefits must be weighed against the significant costs of the programs during more normal times, including the likelihood that lax federal credit policies were an exacerbating cause of the 2007 financial crisis. © 2016, Brookings Institution Press.

The aim of the study is to examine healthcare services in Fjallabyggð, in rural northern Iceland, from users’ perspective and evaluate social justice, access and quality of healthcare in an age of austerity. Mixed-method approach with transformative design was used. First, data were collected with questionnaires (response rate of 53% [N=732] in 2009 and 30% [N=415] in 2012), and analysed statistically, followed by 10 interviews with healthcare users (2009 and 2014). The results were integrated and interpreted within Bronfenbrenner’s Ecological Model. There was significantly less satisfaction with accessibility and variety of healthcare services in 2012 after services downsizing. Solid primary healthcare, good local elderly care, some freedom in healthcare choice and reliable emergency services were considered fundamental for life in a rural area. Equal access to healthcare is part of a fundamental human right. In times of economic downturn, people in rural areas, who are already vulnerable, may become even more vulnerable and disadvantaged, seriously threatening social justice and equity.

The housing situation has had a negative impact upon these communities in a variety of ways, and in the case of Karratha in particular, constitutes a community crisis. This study demonstrates the important linkages between housing and the resources industry. It discusses the key issues evidenced by case studies of four resource boom towns; two in Western Australia and two in Queensland. These case studies provide a detailed picture of the wide range of issues faced by these towns and the social, economic and structural consequences of the resources boom. An enduring issue is the inability of the public and private sectors to attract and retain staff in resource boom towns whatever their occupation, but this is especially apparent for workers in the service sector. Business and community development are stymied by the ever-decreasing locally resident workforce, a direct result of the increasing lack of available and/or affordable housing. A range of skill sets for the resources industries are in short supply. The nature and locations of mining operations, combined with the lack of available and affordable housing and associated industry cost structures, has led the resource sector to increasingly rely upon a long-distance commuting workforce. The increase of fly-in, fly-out (FIFO) and drive-in, drive-out (DIDO) workers has led to a reduction in the permanently resident workforce. This research confirms the role of housing as an essential component of the physical infrastructure underpinning the mining industry. The links between housing and economic and social wellbeing in a regional context are clearly demonstrated. We argue that a holistic appreciation by the industry and government of the important role of housing at each stage of the mining cycle has been lacking in Australia. The recent super-cycle in the resources industry in Australia resulted in critical housing issues requiring strategic responses to enable the industry to expand to meet international demand and in order to address the most serious social and economic impacts for local and regional communities. Although the current downturn in the industry, as a result of the global financial crisis, has temporarily eased some of the pressure on housing markets in resource communities, a likely resurgence in demand for resources over the longer term means that all of the issues identified in this report remain on the table and should be addressed. Efforts to manage the housing implications of mining face considerable challenges including: the diversity in scale and nature of the industry and its impacts; the cyclical and often unpredictable nature of the resources industry; the propensity for mining to be located in regional and remote areas; changing technology and labour market practices; and differences in policy and institutional arrangements across Australian jurisdictions. We put forward a range of proposals for immediate and longer-term strategies to better manage housing issues, particularly in areas such as resource-rich regions which are vulnerable to world market prices and consumer trends. Specifically: A categorical commitment from governments regarding the positive long-term future for communities in remote regions. In light of this reality, there is a case for a more co-ordinated approach, between government and industry, (but led by government), to better plan for these regions. Government and non-government organisation (NGO) decision and implementation processes can no longer lag behind growth as this will hamper co-ordinated planning. It is critically important that governments act to ensure the adequate supply of land that has the potential to be serviced at the earliest opportunity when a resource development project is planned and then work assiduously to ensure that the land is brought to development status as soon as possible. ?The provision of realistic incentives for investment in infrastructure by business and community. The recent Western Australian election campaign Royalties for Regions highlighted the importance of enhancing life in royalty-generating regions through targeted funding for key infrastructure. Government does not have to be the sole provider but meaningful incentives for partnerships between governments and industry must be established to convey mutual commitment. ?Increased government investment in social, community and affordable housing including the use of innovative financing tools such as shared-equity schemes and taxation incentives for investment in affordable housing, with particular attention to housing in regional and remote areas. It has been suggested that the rules governing LandCorp in Western Australia could be relaxed to enable more affordable housing land in the regions. ?The provision of affordable accommodation for those on low-to-middle incomes not eligible for housing assistance but who are excluded from the private market due to the shortages of available affordable accommodation for rent or purchase. Once demand has been met for serviced land, government agencies should consider serviced land banking for future development to avoid long development delays. Relaxing local government town planning policies to enable greater flexibility regarding development densities and transformation of current housing stock. Fast-tracking planning approvals for residential developments that contain an element of affordable housing should be considered. Affordable housing does not mean aesthetically unattractive. An increased supply of government housing for key workers and government service providers to meet current and future needs, commensurate with population increases. Government employee housing needs to be of a standard to ensure the attraction and retention of key human resources. All publicly provided housing needs to be consistently maintained and upgraded to ensure: sustainable standards of population health; enhanced education opportunities; liveability; and accessibility. Substance abuse underpins many of the social and economic ills of remote and regional communities, particularly those in or near to resource-dominated towns. The link between good housing and good health has been demonstrated. In order to effectively deal with the myriad issues arising from substance abuse and poor, or lack of housing, governments should adopt a relational approach which takes into account the need for complex community development. To this end, government housing agencies need to liaise more closely with health agencies, and agencies of the Drug and Alcohol Office. The liveability of resource boom towns could be greatly enhanced if the design and planning of towns was undertaken with an eye to permanence and a diversification of the economic base underpinning the local economy. Many of the necessary strategies require longer-term implementation timeframes. Successful housing strategies in mining communities require co-ordinated action by all spheres of government as well as the mining and residential property industries. This involves resolution of the diverse interests of these stakeholders and agreement about who is responsible for what. Local communities and NGOs have an important role to play in identifying community concerns and potential responses. In discussing proposed strategies we address the following key questions. What needs to be done? Why is it necessary? Who needs to take primary responsibility? What policies, partnerships and governance structures are needed for successful implementation? A recurring theme in this report is the need to improve co-ordination within and between the different levels of government, and in turn, between mining companies and government. Better planning is critical to ensure an adequate supply and mix of housing in mining communities and in particular, to address the issue of affordability. While towns are vulnerable to the resources super-cycle, their future is tenuous. If an effort was made to plan and design towns to enhance liveability and attractiveness, there is a greater likelihood of increased private investment in businesses and the community.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84907581411"

In response to the growth in liabilities, many states have introduced legislation that cuts back on defined benefit (DB) plan commitments, in some cases even shifting the pension system from a DB to a defined contribution or hybrid plan. This paper explores the factors that have led states to engage in pension reform, focusing particular attention on one factor that has only recently gained attention in the research literature: Contribution volatility. While unfunded liabilities have significant long-term solvency implications, in the short term fluctuations in the amount of required contributions pose substantial difficulties for the ability of plan sponsors to balance budgets and engage in strategic planning. We begin by quantifying the volatility in the required contributions US states were expected to make between 2001 and 2013 and comparing the volatility of pension spending to other relevant tax and spending measures. Next, we describe the various types of pension reforms that states have implemented and examine the fiscal pressures facing those states that have engaged in reform. States with greater fluctuations in their required payments have been more likely to reduce benefits and increase employee contributions; they have also been more likely to institute these reforms sooner. © Copyright Cambridge University Press 2017.","Contribution volatility; Defined benefit plans; Pension reform; Public pensions","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85017190685"

By the means of a comparative case study of ""guest workers"" in the 1960s/1970s and labor migrants in 2000s, we identify changes in discourses and policy frames brought on by economic crisis. In the article, we explore policy transformations relating to integration in the light of periods economic upturns and downturns. We analyze and compare the development of policy frames and policy content before, during and after the crises and thereby seek to answer how economic contours affect not only policy-making processes and content but also the social construction of target groups. The fact that Denmark did not have an official policy on integration of the guest workers in the 1960s and 1970s created a different point of departure than in the 2000s where the experience with and policy on integration of immigrant is much more developed. It is therefore also rather striking that many of the mistakes made during the 1960s and 1970s seems to be repeated in the 2000s. The situation of economic upturn and envision of the migration being temporary did, in both cases, lead to little emphasis on integration up until the point of crisis. In the analysis, we find that issues such as religious background, cultural characteristics, and educational levels, position on labor market, language proficiency, housing, and mobility which all pertain to integration are given less attention in times of economic upturn. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Economic crises; Integration; Labor migration; Policy frames; Policy-making","Denmark; comparative study; crisis management; economic impact; financial crisis; historical perspective; immigrant population; immigration policy; labor migration; policy making","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84876166180"

Our research shows evidence that the wine market is heterogeneous with wine regions and price categories evolving differently in terms of volume and turnover. We find that fine wine yields higher returns and has a lower volatility compared to stocks especially in times of economic crises. Forming portfolios for typical investors and taking risk aversion, different financial assets and various wine indices into consideration we confirm that the addition of wine to a portfolio as a separate asset-class is beneficial for private investors. Not only are returns favorably impacted and risk being minimized but skewness and kurtosis are also positively affected. Particularly, during the recent financial crisis these effects are most pronounced and improve portfolio diversification when it is most needed. Most importantly, balancing a portfolio with fine wine has resulted in added return while reducing volatility with the most prestigious and expensive vintages and estates outperforming the General Wine Index (GWI) during the entire research period. Results from the CAPM show that alpha is significantly positive over the period 1996–2009 while showing a low beta coefficient. The use of a conditional CAPM model allows us to clarify the time-variance of alphas and betas depending on the economic environment that is not generally captured by the traditional CAPM. The time-varying dynamics of alphas and betas are in particular explained by the spread between BAA-and AAA-rated bonds and the USD/EUR foreign exchange rate. Our findings confirm that wine returns are primarily related to economic conditions and not to market risk. © 2018, World Scientific Publishing Co. Pte Ltd.

In particular, it aims to understand and explain the progressive growing opposition towards EU institutions within Italian public opinion. For decades, both Italian media and political parties have depicted Italy as one of the strongest pro-European countries. However, more recently, Italian public opinion started to look at Europe with more critical eyes, while the consensus of Eurosceptic parties grew. Although the downturn in Italian support for Europe appears evident, both its causes and consequences are largely under-investigated. The purpose of this paper is to fill in this analytical gap by looking at the origins of diffuse support for Europe in Italy. The analysis proceeds through a three-stage strategy, aiming to observe: 1) the explanatory factors of diffuse support in Italy, 2) the effects of the economic crisis on the sentiments of support and 3) the European identity of the Italian public. The data have been supplied by the Eurobarometer series since 1990 and analysed through logistic and linear models. Findings reveal the indirect effects of the current economic crisis on diffuse support for Europe in Italy, since trust towards the national government and perceptions of EU utility decrease for the effects of the recession. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","Diffuse support; economic crisis; European identity; Italy","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84896318853"

The activity of Spanish firms engaged in the construction of buildings, civil engineering, and specialized activities during the 2000s is used as a case study. Productivity change is estimated by creating a bilateral index using data envelopment analysis, complemented with bootstrapping. The results showed that Spanish firms in building construction experienced a fall in productivity because of a decline in technical and scale efficiencies, despite improvements in technology. The productivity change in civil engineering and specialized construction also was negative; however, the source of this decline was technical regress and negative scale efficiency change, although efficiency change and technology scale change contributed positively. The results further revealed that the firms reacted to the financial crisis of the late 2000s by introducing technological change, although the productive, technical, and scale efficiency changes all were negatively impacted during the economic downturn, suggesting an underuse of resources. This research contributes to the body of knowledge by being the first to analyze the impact of fluctuations in business cycles caused by the 2008 economic crisis on the productivity growth of construction firms representing three construction sectors, and by measuring productivity growth from a multidimensional perspective. © 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Bootstrap; Data envelopment analysis; Economic crisis; Malmquist index; Organizational issues","Construction; Construction industry; Data envelopment analysis; Economic and social effects; Efficiency; Bootstrap; Construction of buildings; Construction sectors; Economic crisis; Malmquist indices; Organizational issues; Productivity changes; Technological change; Productivity","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85016973762"

This paper studies the distributional and fiscal implications of output changes in Germany 2008-2009, using data available prior to the economic downturn. We first estimate labor demand on 12 years of detailed, administrative matched employer-employee data. The distributional analysis is then conducted by transposing predicted employment effects of actual output shocks to household-level microdata. A scenario in which labor demand adjustments occur at the intensive margin (hour changes), close to the German experience, shows less severe effects on the income distribution compared to a situation where adjustments take place through massive layoffs. Adjustments at the intensive margin are also preferable from a fiscal point of view. In this context, we discuss the cushioning effect of the tax-benefit system and the conditions under which German-style work-sharing policies can be successful in other countries. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Crisis; Income distribution; Labor demand; Output shock; Tax-benefit system","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84855869924"

Quantitative findings are stratified along experiential lines to explore heterogeneity in entrepreneurial decision-making and directly inform our conceptual arguments, while qualitative data from open questions are used to explain the role of confidence. Newer entrepreneurs are found to be more optimistic in the face of environmental risk, which impacts on their decision-making and innovative capabilities.

Instead of looking directly at the confidence of individuals, we show how confidence impacts sensemaking, and ultimately, decision-making.

However, no detailed information is available concerning the type of PD that improves their performance. In addition, it is still uncertain how much changes in institutional dimensions influence the effectiveness of PD. Therefore, the aim is to resolve this issue by establishing a model that shows the extent of this influence. Design/methodology/approach: The generalised method of moments (GMM) estimator is used to model the PD strategies of 86 LCFs in Malaysia over 14 years (2003–2016) and its impact on productivity and profitability performance. Findings: Unrelated diversification (UD) decreased firm performance in 2003–2016, while related diversification (RD) had a positive impact during the more liberal 2010–2016 phase. The models show that the impact of PD is highly dependent on changes in institutional dimensions. Practical implications: Firstly, managers may adjust the type of PD and its level of diversification to improve firm performance. Secondly, they may devise PD strategies based on changes in institutional dimensions to maximise their effectiveness. Originality/value: The study contributes to the literature by determining the optimal amount of PD (including RD and UD) and its impact on performance. Secondly, the study is the first to investigate the moderating relationship of the institutional dimensions of economic and regulatory institutions on PD-firm performance. Thirdly, the study is the first to explore the components of technical-scale-scope economies (movement towards and around the production frontier), this being crucial to the strategy that was only conjectured in previous studies. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Construction; Diversification; Institutions; Malaysia; Product diversification; Productivity; Profitability; Related diversification; Scale economies; Scope economies; Unrelated diversification","Construction industry; Method of moments; Construction firms; Design/methodology/approach; Firm Performance; Malaysia; Product diversification; Production frontier; Scope economies; Spread risks; Productivity","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85088578653"

P&SE delivers more extensive social returns than higher education and is perhaps the most important locus where core values are established and the foundation for educational super-systems. The purpose of this paper is to develop a structured approach for the implementation of total quality management (TQM) in P&SE and validate it empirically. Design/methodology/approach: A 7-dimensioned and a 66-itemed instrument was developed and administered to education professionals at Greek P&SE institutions to measure TQM implementation at present and its potential for the future. The measures were tested for validity and reliability. Findings: The findings confirmed that the instrument developed is both valid and reliable. The factors of TQM identified for P&SE were leadership, student focus, continuous improvement, process control and involvement, education and training, measurement and evaluation, and change management. Practical implications: P&SE institutions can employ the instrument developed to guide their implementation of TQM practices. Researchers and practitioners can use it to build models to relate facilitating practices to quality performance while enhancing social empowerment and contributing to economic growth, particularly at times of economic difficulty. Originality/value: The present study adds value to the existing literature by investigating the unexplored field of TQM in P&SE at a time of economic downturn by offering researchers and practitioners a starting point to identify areas that require further support and improvement or have potential efficiency gain. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Greek education system; Measurement instrument; Primary and secondary education; Quality of education; Total quality management","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85067614061"

Despite this extensive research interest, the approaches used and the results obtained are still vague and strongly biased towards very few positive regional examples around the world. Nevertheless, the concepts derived from this work were quickly transformed into regional policy strategies. Networks and co-operations almost became key words for successful regional economic development. This paper is primarily concerned with the adoption of these concepts by regional decision-makers. The possibilities and limitations of co-operation- or network-orientated regional strategies are discussed with special reference to the Neckar-Alb region in Baden-Württemberg. This area is confronted with a severe economic downturn and massive job losses in some of its leading manufacturing sectors. Regional decision-makers try to overcome these problems with strategies which very much reflect the fashionable concepts of intensified regional co-operation and networking. In the light of our empirical findings, however, it is doubtful whether these strategies can be successful. Effective regional networks are rare highlights in the world economy. They rely on specific conditions which cannot be reproduced easily within a couple of years. Furthermore, regional actors are in an ever more weakening position to promote or control relevant factors of regional economic development in a rapidly globalising economy.","","Germany, Baden-Wurttemberg, Neckar-Alb; industrial linkage; industrial policy; manufacturing; policy evaluation; regional development","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0030803230"

We extracted the three most important variables in this process: economic fluctuation, local debt risk and bank risk-taking to build an econometric model and found that: (1) both economic fluctuations and local government bond risks have a significant impact on bank risk-taking, which is negatively correlated with local economic growth, while the increase of local government bond risks tends to increase bank risk-taking in the long run; (2) the impact of local government debt risk significantly increases the loans of city commercial banks flowing into the construction industry. Therefore, the impact of local government bond risk on city commercial banks is concentrated in the impact on their construction loans.

Based on dyadic buyer-supplier case data from a variety of industries that were deeply affected by the 2008-2009 recession, this article explores how long-term relationships responded to an economic downturn. Prior to the downturn, these mutually dependent relationships all appeared to be very similar to each other and were characterized by significant value-added and social capital stores. However, due to varying degrees of bounded rationality, the relationships were affected differently and responded differently to the downturn.

Following the economic downturn and the ensuing crisis of stagflation, workers' uprisings became increasingly common in West Germany. The summer of 1973 saw a sharp increase in workers' activism broadly, including a wave of women's strikes. However, historical attention to the role of foreign workers, especially of foreign female workers, within these strikes has been limited. This article presents a case study of wildcat strikes spearheaded by foreign, female workers in the early 1970s, focusing specifically on the strikes at the Pierburg Autoparts Factory in Neuss, West Germany. For these foreign women, activism in the early 1970s had a larger significance than just securing better working conditions. Indeed, striking foreign workers were no longer negotiating temporary problems; they were signaling that they were there to stay. Foreign workers' sustained and successful activism challenged the imposed category of guest worker, switching the emphasis from guest to worker. Ultimately, the Pierburg strikes' outcomes benefited all workers - foreign and German, male and female - and had grave implications for wage discrimination across West Germany as well.

Design/methodology/approach: Using a recent sample of firms in 34 countries between 2003 and 2021, the authors employ ordinary least squares regressions, moderations and the Heckman two-step method to test the hypotheses. Findings: Firms with strong SP have higher FP in developed and emerging economies in the upcoming year. During the COVID-19 crisis in 2020–2021, the impact of sustainability on FP is pronounced in developed but not in emerging economies. Furthermore, cross-listings expose firms in emerging economies to high-standard institutional mechanisms in developed economies. Thus, sustainable firms in emerging economies cross-listed on European stock exchanges are more profitable. Practical implications: For regulators and standard setters, the global-level comparative analysis helps them find solutions that may assist firms in improving SP globally (e.g. mandatory reporting) and enduring crises resiliently. For institutional investors, the study reveals the relatively different impact of sustainability risk for firms in developed and emerging economies. For practitioners and private sector firms, this study contributes to the dialogue on what makes firms more resilient in COVID-19. Although COVID-19 might be temporary, the lessons learned could protect firms from future crises. Originality/value: The authors contribute to the contingency perspective between sustainability and financial performance by providing recent empirical evidence in a global setting during the COVID-19 pandemic. The authors demonstrate how different external institutional mechanisms (rule-based governance and relation-based governance) and cross-listing affect the SP-FP relationship during a crisis. The authors extend the knowledge in crisis management literature with a comparative study and fill the research gap on how SP affects FP for firms in emerging economies compared to developed economies. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","COVID-19; Developed economies; Emerging economies; Financial performance; Internationalization; Sustainability","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85143718874"

Trade credit is important for small-and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), especially during a monetary contraction, as it is the last option for firms that lack bank credit. This study aims to determine whether trade credit is profitable for the buyer and supplier firms during and after a financial crisis. We use panel data consisting of all trade credit transactions and financial statements of 5,751 Korean firms during the period 2008-2012. It shows that trade credit is more profitable for both buyers and suppliers in the post-crisis period than during the crisis. Moreover, trade payable is more effective for unconstrained buyers than for constrained buyers. Finally, a mixed strategy is superior to an aggressive or passive strategy of SMEs. The results suggest less profitability of trade credit during a period of contraction and greater sensitivity of the buyer SMEs, emphasizing the idiosyncratic liquidity strategy of each firm. This study can be helpful to develop a strategy of profitable trade credit for SMEs and to establish a policy of managing liquidity for the authority. © The Author(s).","Credit constraints; Financial crisis; Financial performance; Trade credit","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85091418495"

Why would a leader do this? We argue that political leaders can gain from such agreements because of the signals they send to their public. The public are less likely to blame leaders for adverse economic conditions when they have implemented sound economic policies, such as signing agreements designed to liberalize trade and prevent a slide into protectionism. In hard economic times, leaders - especially those in democratic environments - may find that trade agreements are a useful way to reassure the public. Since majorities in many countries around the world view trade favorably, leaders may see agreements that prevent them from adopting protectionism as a way to maintain support. We evaluate this argument by analyzing preferential trade agreements (PTAs) formed since 1962. We find that, on average, democratic countries are more likely to form PTAs during hard economic times. We also find that democratic leaders who sign PTAs during downturns enjoy a longer tenure than their counterparts who do not sign such agreements. Copyright © Edward D. Mansfield And Helen V.

Indeed, there is sparse evidence that corporate advantage exists, on average. We explore one potential driver of corporate advantage—that multi-business firms have more flexibility than single-business firms to cope with uncertainty, because they can internally redeploy resources across businesses. Using Compustat data, we show that uncertainty increases the relative advantage of multi-business firms, a finding robust to controls for endogeneity. Consequently, the paper provides important insight and evidence around when corporate advantage might obtain. Moreover, we find that growth option value is accentuated in the presence of switching flexibility. Finally, multi-business firms with redeployment experience and businesses with more inversely correlated returns benefit more from uncertainty. Managerial Summary: Multi-business firms have a flexibility advantage over single-business firms as they can reallocate firm resources from one business unit to another depending on inducements. What is the impact of this flexibility on firm value? In this paper, we test whether such a flexibility advantage translates into greater economic returns in more volatile markets. We expect that resource redeployment creates value if it amplifies business-specific positive shocks while alleviating business-specific downturns. Consistent with this argument, we find empirical evidence that with increasing stock market volatility, multi-business firms benefit significantly more in terms of firm value than their single-business counterparts. In particular, in highly volatile stock markets, monthly adjusted returns are 2.3 times higher for multi-business firms than for single-business firms. © 2022 The Authors.

However, to date, these policies have not, for the most part, taken sufficient account of the gender and health dimensions of working longer. This chapter outlines the empirical and policy landscapes that are present in Europe and several other countries. It examines the different meanings of ‘extended working life’ and the indicators used to justify raising the age of eligibility for a pension. Gender and health inequalities related to extended working life, such as gender pay and pension gaps and differential life expectancy rates are presented. The influence of the labour market on the employability of older workers is examined in the context of economic downturns and digitalisation. The chapter concludes that policy initiatives which meet the diverse needs of older workers and which address gender and health inequalities related to extended working should be a priority for governments and employers in the years ahead. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s) 2020.

Given sustained IT investments and rapid adoption of various IT in developing countries (e.g. China) in the 2000s, there is a need for new research to test whether prior findings still hold true with up-to-date data from a period of economic downturn in developing countries. Thus, this study attempted to reexamine the linkage between IT capability and financial performance during recent financial crisis in 2008, especially in China context. Our results show that during the period of financial crisis, Chinese firms with superior IT capability tend to outperform a sample of control firms on average profit ratios but not on cost ratios, even after adjusting for prior performance. We also find that the profit performance effects of IT capability can be sustained over a long period of economic downturn.

We evaluate three potential sources of model risk: model specification, sample selection and stress scenario selection applied to credit card portfolios, a major portion of a bank’s balance sheet. Our analysis indicates that model specifications that incorporate interactions between macroeconomic variables and core account characteristics generate more accurate loss projections across risk segments than specifications that do not. The sensitivity of modeled losses to macroeconomic factors depends on the severity of the downturn in the model development sample. Pre-2007 models estimated over a period that included the 2001–2 recession fail to project levels of credit loss consistent with those experienced during the Great Recession. These models estimated over a time period that did not include a significant economic downturn severely underpredict credit loss for some segments and the levels of forecast error are significantly affected by model specification assumptions. Prime borrower segments of the portfolio are more severely affected by downturn economic conditions and model specification assumptions relative to the subprime or near-prime segments. The selection of the stress scenario can have a dramatic impact on projected loss. © 2015 Incisive Risk Information (IP) Limited.","Credit cards; Credit risk; Model risk; Regulatory capital; Stress test","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84973495955"

Our results suggest that the Swedish policy of advice and trust in the population to reduce social interactions voluntarily was relatively successful. Sweden combined low excess death rates with relatively small economic costs. In future pandemics, policymakers should rely on empirical evidence rather than panicking and adopting extreme measures.

In both instances, however, enacted legislation stopped short of changing the way in which executive pay was determined or placing effective, enforceable limits on it. I analyze the nature of the democratic process and contend that public policy scholars need to pay more attention to the occurrence of symbolic policies.

Systemic risk starts to accumulate in the financial sector during periods of boom when the output gap is positive. Furthermore, during periods of robust economic growth, the level of credit tends to increase dramatically, going hand in hand with asset and property prices developments. We also find that contribution and exposure to system-wide distress move procyclically during credit and house cycles, meaning that during upturns in credit and house cycles bank interconnectedness increases, but tend to fall during the downturns. However, individual risk of the banks evolves countercyclically during business and financial cycles. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","bank fragility; business cycle; financial cycle; financial regulation; Key-words: systemic risk","Europe; banking; business cycle; economic growth; European Union; financial system; risk assessment","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85091735337"

Despite this, few interventions have been developed to improve employment outcomes by addressing the health needs of women receiving TANF, and little is known about the impact of economic downturns on the employment trajectory of this group. Using data from a recent randomized controlled trial (RCT) that tested the efficacy of a public health nursing (PHN) intervention to address the chronic health condition needs of 432 American women receiving TANF, we examine the effect of the intervention and of recession exposure on employment. We further explore whether intervention effects were modified by select sociodemographic and health characteristics. Both marginal and more robust intervention effects were noted for employment-entry outcomes (any employment, p = 0.05 and time-to-employment, p = 0.01). There were significant effects for recession exposure on employment-entry (any employment, p = 0.002 and time-to-employment, p < 0.001). Neither the intervention nor recession exposure influenced longer-term employment outcomes (employment rate or maximum continuous employment). Intervention effects were not modified by age, education, prior TANF receipt, functional status, or recession exposure, suggesting the intervention was equally effective in improving employment-entry across a fairly heterogeneous group both before and after the recession onset. These findings advance our understanding of the health and employment dynamics among this group of disadvantaged women under variable macroeconomic conditions, and have implications for guiding health and TANF-related policy. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Economic recession; Health disparities; Public health nursing; Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF); U.S.A.; Welfare policy; Women's health","Adult; Economic Recession; Employment; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Health Promotion; Humans; Program Evaluation; Social Welfare; United States; Young Adult; MLCS; MLOWN; American; clinical trial; community health nursing; controlled clinical trial; economic recession; education; employment; exposure; female; functional status; human; major clinical study; randomized controlled trial; welfare; adult; article; controlled study; follow up; health care quality; health promotion; methodology; social welfare; statistics; United States","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84876488840"

Based on a new corporate microsimulation model, ZEW TaxCoMM, we assess the heterogeneous effects of the tax reform on firms, varying according to some of the firms' key characteristics. This is important for understanding the reform's implications in view of the recent economic crisis. Moreover, the model also allows for the behavioral responses of firms to a new tax environment. The 2008 reform has indeed been targeted at affecting firm behavior, in particular profit-shifting incentives. By means of a detailed reform costing, the model can investigate the extent to which the 2008 reform can actually be considered self-financing. The simulation results show that in times of economic downturn, with shrinking profitability and increasing demand for external financing, the 2008 reform might indeed exert a procyclical effect on the economy: Companies losing from the reform are exactly those that feature a low profitability, a high debt ratio, and high capital intensity. With regard to revenue consequences, the reform provisions are simulated to lead to a 19.7% decline in aggregate tax revenue. However, taking into account behavioral responses of firms with respect to their financing, investment, and profit-shifting behavior, total revenue is simulated to reach again 84.7% of the 2007 benchmark revenue, even in the short term. In a rather long-term perspective, the reform might even be 92.4% self-financing. © 2013 Mohr Siebeck.","Microsimulation; Tax policy evaluation; Tax reform","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84874691129"

These new developments - and the corresponding risk management strategies - will change the calculus of interests, powers and strategies for all actors, with significant impacts on the global political economy. Climate change action (such as targets for emissions reductions) will challenge the existing power structures, with the transition to a low-carbon economy creating new winners and losers in the global economy. Today, there is a fresh appreciation about the consequences of bad policy choices. Comparisons have been drawn between the fallout in the global financial system and the kind of risks that unmitigated climate change may bring. Even though the pressure on some resources may have eased since the onset of the global economic downturn in 2008, it is unlikely that the longer term trajectory has been reversed. This calls for renewed understanding and appreciation of the magnitude of risks foreseen. Multiple public goods need to be generated from the same production systems or sectors. In the context of climate change, international cooperation offers the only option that can best serve even narrowly defined national interests.

Use of text messaging reminders has the potential to increase adherence to family planning appointments and to educate patients about safe sexual health practices; however, nonresponsiveness to messages is difficult to interpret and may jeopardize programmatic success. We aimed to understand why adolescent girls enrolled in a randomized, controlled pilot trial (DepoText) designed to increase attendance at family planning visits were periodically nonresponsive to text messages through conducting structured interviews with participants whose text reply rates were less than 100 % during the trial period. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected and classified using descriptive data analysis. Reasons for nonresponsiveness, barriers to continuous cell phone coverage, cell phone plan characteristics, and attitudes toward the DepoText program were the primary endpoints of interest. Most participants (78 %) attributed instances of nonresponsiveness to being away from the phone or due to a personal conflict such as school or work. Service interruption due to bill nonpayment (44 %), phone loss (28 %), and cell phone number change (28 %) were significant barriers to continuous coverage during the trial period, and many respondents indicated that the downturn in the economy made it more difficult to maintain their cell phone plan. Almost a third reported having to choose between cell phone and other payments, but the vast majority (88 %) considered their cell phone a “need” rather than a “want.” Participants universally expressed satisfaction with the text messaging program and reported feeling more connected to the clinic (96 %) through the messages serving as reminders (64 %), encouragement to assume personal responsibility for their health care (12 %), and enhanced personal connection with the clinic staff (4 %). Our study suggests that a text messaging program can be used in an urban clinical setting to communicate with adolescent girls about family planning services. While economic barriers to continuous cell phone coverage do exist, adolescents indicate that the text message reminder system can be a valuable tool for enhancing clinic connectedness and promoting autonomy in care-seeking behavior. © 2015, The New York Academy of Medicine.","Adolescent; Low-Income; Text messaging; Urban","Adolescent; Attitude to Health; Cell Phones; Family Planning Services; Female; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Male; Psychology, Adolescent; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Text Messaging; Young Adult; adolescent; attitude to health; child psychology; family planning; female; human; interview; male; mobile phone; procedures; randomized controlled trial (topic); text messaging; young adult","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84930379865"

Non-western migrants are more likely to experience a double mismatch, i.e. a horizontal as well as a vertical mismatch. Furthermore, western migrants are more likely to experience horizontal mismatches than natives. Analyses on whether ethnic penalties persist across the non-western minority show that Antillean migrants have relatively good labour market outcomes whereas Moroccan migrants are the worst off. Furthermore, we find a gender dimension in the educational mismatches for western migrants. While western male migrants only show slight differences in labour market outcomes, western female migrants are less likely to be correctly matched and more likely to be unemployed than their native counterparts. Comparing educational mismatches before and during the recent economic crisis shows that in times of economic downturns, the labour market position of non-western migrants is disproportionally negatively affected. © 2020 The Author(s).

This paper explores whether Appalachian neighborhoods closer to coal waste impoundments experienced steeper poverty changes from 1990 to 2000. Impoundment failures have resulted in some of the largest environmental disasters in U.S. history and scientists have expressed concerns over their growing heights and risks. Spatial regression models show that neighborhoods closer to impoundments have higher poverty increases on average, even after controlling for mining employment and other variables. These findings highlight the need for a deeper consideration of the environmental inequalities associated with the continued downturn of coal production and employment in the United States. Further, discussions about just transitions must recognize the legacy hazards and externalities associated with extractive industries–and their impacts on communities. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis.","Appalachia; coal mining; environmental inequality; just transitions; resource-dependent communities","Appalachians; United States; coal mining; coal production; empirical analysis; employment; environmental degradation; equity; poverty; socioeconomic status","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85048363554"

The analysis looks at employment behavior among artists as an occupational group compared to other creative class workers and analyzes trends in periods before, during and after the recession. The results suggest that as a result of the downturn, many artists changed occupations to non-arts-related work or left the workforce altogether; artists became self-employed, and new artists opted for self-employment over wage/salary work; artists were disproportionately adversely impacted – either unemployed or underemployed – than other types of workers. Level of educational attainment was a significant determinant of whether an artist maintained quality employment and stayed in the occupation of his choice; and gender and marital status had a bearing on artists' ability to remain employed as an artist and maintain quality employment. The analysis emphasizes the importance of examining specific occupations within the creative class before drawing broad conclusions pertaining to all occupations with this title.

To assess how economic downturns have influenced demographic dynamics across regions in Greece—perhaps the European country most affected by the 2007 recession—the present study investigates spatial patterns of population increase and decline (2002–2017) in 51 prefectures, evaluating the contribution of natural balance (births minus deaths) and migration to total population growth during economic expansion (2002–2009) and recession (2010–2017). Population increased during economic expansion in semicentral regions with medium-size urban centres, upper economic functions (university and international airport), and road infrastructures. Although natural balance was positive in almost all prefectures, migration contributed the most to population growth during 2002–2009. A generalised population decline was observed during recession, except in coastal areas specialised in tourism, the only regions still attracting migratory flows and maintaining a slightly positive natural balance. The largest urban areas (Athens, Salonika) experienced the highest rate of population decline, thanks to accelerated emigration and a moderately negative natural balance. Population dynamics during economic expansion contributed to increase a traditional density gap between urban and rural areas. Conversely, population dynamics during recession led to a spatial redistribution of population, reducing the gap between urban areas and rural, tourism-specialised coastal districts. Evidence in our study supports a need for further investigation into the role of economic downturns in future population redistribution processes, specifically “shrinking” regions. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","migration; multivariate analysis; natural balance; population density; southern Europe","Greece; coastal zone; economic instability; financial crisis; international migration; multivariate analysis; population dynamics; rural population; spatial distribution; urban population","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85070747509"

Since hotel-based fitness firms have targeted both residents and tourists, the declining customer inflows have alarmed non-hotel-based fitness firms, leading to explore the market and appraise their service qualities, particularly given that their customers have experienced unexpected reductions in their discretionary spending habits. This paper analyzes factors in customers' perception of service quality and its relation to customer satisfaction and retention. A sample of 186 member-customers was randomly selected from all non-hotel-based fitness firms functioning in Abu Dhabi. The primary data were collected through surveys and interviews. Respondents prioritized price, quality, hygiene and safety as major factors when assessing service quality. Although a high service quality index score and customer satisfaction indicated the drive for customer retention, the steady-state matrix apparent in the second year in a Markov analysis suggests that firms focus on improvising their marketing mix to increase customers' spending time in fitness centers and maximize customers' satisfaction with the main purpose of their visit, their own wellbeing and stress reduction. This study fills a research gap and helps fitness firms understand the importance of appraising customers' perceptions of service quality in a downswing market, and of devising niche strategies to gain competitive advantage. © 2020 by the authors; licensee Growing Science.","Abu Dhabi; Customer retention; Customer satisfaction; Fitness industry; Service quality; UAE market","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85081561453"

Using an innovative methodology for measuring job quality, the study provides an empirical analysis of employment shifts that occurred during the Great Recession both quantitatively (how many jobs created or destroyed) as well as qualitatively (what types of jobs created or destroyed). A notable feature of the shifts observed in the employment structure during this time period is a deepening pattern of inequality in the labor market characterized by increased wage polarization for all workers and evidence of downgrading experienced by male workers across all three measures of job quality. © 2018 The Author(s) 2018.

This study examines the response to economic pressure of a cohort of youth first studied 20 years ago as adolescents and now grown to adulthood.

Data analyses were guided by the interactionist model which proposed that positive G2 personality attributes during adolescence would predict lower economic pressure during adulthood and would diminish the negative family processes related to economic pressure expected to disrupt competent G3 development. The findings were consistent with this social selection aspect of the interactionist model. The model also predicted that economic pressure and other aspects of the related family stress process would affect G3 development net of earlier G2 personality. This social causation aspect of the interactionist model also received support. The findings suggest that the relationship between economic conditions and child development reflect a dynamic process of selection and causation that plays out over time and generations.","3-Generations; Child development; Economic pressure; Personality","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-77953484238"

Design/methodology/approach: The paper explores companies which have used or are using cause-related marketing, from McDonald's 1984-established Ronald McDonald House to the newer LIVESTRONG campaign, and examines which programs' successes, failures and consumer reactions. Findings: According to the 2008 Edelman goodpurpose study, 63 percent of consumers think companies spend too much on marketing and advertising and should set aside more for a ""good cause"". Even during a recession, the study adds, 80 percent of global consumers think it is still important that brands and companies set aside money for a social purpose. A recent survey of 9,000 consumers worldwide by Boston Consulting Group indicates that, despite the economic downturn, buying green products remains a priority - a majority of respondents in all countries expressed a willingness to pay a premium of 5 percent or more for green products, and 73 percent considered it important that companies have good environmental records. Practical implications: Today, cause marketing is more than just a trend - it is an imperative. What began as a simple way to build brand affinity has become a consumer expectation in an era in which sustainable and ethical consumer choices are more important than ever before. And within that framework, loyalty marketing tactics are at the heart of creative innovation.

During the crisis, there was a dramatic five-fold spike, across all industries, in “idiosyncratic risk”—the volatility of individual-firm share prices after adjustment for movements in the market as a whole. This phenomenon is not limited to the most recent financial crisis. This Article uses an empirical review to show that a dramatic spike in idiosyncratic risk has occurred with every major downturn from the 1920s through the recent financial crisis. It canvasses three possible explanations for this phenomenon. Thereafter, this Article explores the implications of these crisis-induced volatility spikes for certain legal issues that depend analytically on valuation methodology and hence are affected by volatility: using event studies to determine materiality and loss causation in fraud-on-the-market securities litigation, determining materiality in cases involving claims of both insider trading and misstatements or omissions in registered public offerings, and determining the extent of deference given to a corporate board that rejects an acquisition offer at a premium above the pre-offer market price. This analysis shows that the conventional use of event studies during periods of economic-crisis-induced volatility spikes results in understating the number of occasions when a corporate misstatement can be shown to have had a meaningful impact on a firm’s stock price. Relatedly, the analysis suggests that during crisis times, insiders have substantially more opportunities to profit from trading on the nonpublic information that they possess and issuers conducting offerings have more opportunities to sell securities at an inflated price. Analysis shows that trying to cure this problem by lowering the standard of what is considered statistically significant is as likely to be socially harmful as socially beneficial. These conclusions counsel that the best response to the reduced effectiveness of private litigation as a deterrent to securities law violations during crisis times is to provide additional resources to SEC enforcement. Lastly, with respect to Delaware courts’ recognition of “substantive coercion” as a justification for target-corporation deployment of takeover defenses—arguably a dubious justification in normal times—crisis-induced idiosyncratic-risk spikes provide an unusually plausible claim that target shareholders may indeed make a mistake in tendering into a hostile offer. Analysis of the timing of the spikes in recent cases, however, shows that the claim is tenuous even in these circumstances. © 2016 Columbia Law Review Association.

This complex endeavour could lead to significant spillover effects also upon the agricultural sectors in neighbouring locations, with different overall economic performances for migrant receiving countries. The research is thus set to assess the outcomes of the European agriculture under the impact of economic and humanitarian migration, focusing on the results achieved by ten EU Member States (most targeted by migrants), during 2000–2016. A balanced panel comprising a complex set of indicators was configured in order to provide accurate credentials for the methodological endeavour that consists of spatial analysis and structural equation modelling (SEM).

Both parametric and semiparametric regression methods are applied to analyse the relationships between firm performance and leverage. It is found that the highly leveraged firms in distressed industries face relatively lower sales growth and stock returns but are still able to retain a relatively higher growth in profitability. The findings may suggest that the decline in sales of the highly leveraged firms might be a result of managers' preferences to decrease the activity of product lines with low profitability.","Financial distress; Firm performance; Nonlinear model; Robust regression; Semiparametric regression","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0344629433"

The purpose of this paper is to examine, in an asset pricing framework, whether the systematic risk factors play a significantly different role in explaining the returns of listed real estate companies, compared to general equities. Design/methodology/approach – Running the difference test of the Fama-French three-factor and the liquidity-augmented asset pricing model, the authors analyze the effect of the systematic risk factors related to market, size, BE/ME and liquidity in a time-series setting over the period July 1992 to June 2012. By applying the propensity score matching (PSM) algorithm, the authors bypass the “curse of dimensionality” of traditional matching techniques and identify a comparable control sample of general equities, in terms of the relevant firm characteristics of size, BE/ME and liquidity. Findings – The empirical results indicate that European real estate equity returns load significantly differently on the size, value and liquidity factor, while the influence of the market factor seems to be equivalent. In addition, the authors find an economically and statistically significant underperformance of European real estate equities, after accounting for the diverging role of systematic risk factors. Running the conditional time-series regression, the authors further reveal that these findings are predominately caused by the divergent risk-return behavior of real estate equities in economic downturns. Practical implications – Due to the diverging role of the systematic risk factors in pricing real estate equities, the authors provide evidence of potential diversification benefits for investors and portfolio managers. Originality/value – This is the first real estate asset pricing study to dissect the unique risk-return relationship of real estate equities by employing propensity score matching. © 2015 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Benchmarking; Performance analysis; Propensity score matching; Real estate asset pricing; Real estate equities; Systematic risk factors Paper type Research paper","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84921741821"

The study performs a comparative qualitative analysis using a fs/QCA methodology and identify seven combinations of causes that lead to the outcome.

A research study was carried out in a sample of 233 Greek manufacturing companies operating in a business environment where a financial crisis has dominated for at least four years now. Data were obtained from the Chief Executive Officer of the companies through a structured questionnaire. Exploratory Factor Analysis is applied in order to extract the latent factors of innovation practices, while their validity is confirmed through Confirmatory Factor Analysis. The level of the innovation practices implemented by the companies is determined through descriptive statistics. The analysis of the empirical data from small and medium-sized manufacturing enterprises strongly confirms the conceptual structure of company innovation which consists of four dimensions, namely product, process, marketing and organisational innovation. The level of adoption of the four dimensions of innovation by the sample companies is deemed high, though not, however, excellent. Thus, the sample companies can put additional emphasis on innovation. In doing so, innovation may be a key factor in a company's efforts to overcome the negative effects of the current economic downturn and financial crisis. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","crisis; Greece; innovation; manufacturing SMEs","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84904297689"

This analysis explores the difference between policy script and business performance and identifies key dimensions of material self-interest, nonmarketbased rationales, and divergent private/public discourses as critical to the selective nature of emergent PSE strategies and tactics.

Festival marketplaces were a leading downtown revitalization strategy in American cities during the 1970s and 1980s. The Seaport marketplace was planned and developed over a 20-year period as a joint venture between the non-profit South Street Seaport Museum, the city and state of New York, and the Rouse Company. The Seaport became a popular Manhattan destination, relying upon an expanding banking and financial sector for political support and as a source of demand for retail shops, restaurants and offices. But its marginal profitability eroded with the Wall Street downturn of the late 1980s, and the Museum withdrew from its joint venture with Rouse, unable to realize financial returns to support its operations. This case study illustrates the tension between historic preservation and real estate development, the changing politics of city planning and urban renewal in New York and the economic problems of the festival marketplace.","","United States; joint venture; retailing; urban planning; urban renewal","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0035134786"

Counter-cyclical remittance flows could form part of broader stabilisation policies in economic downturns and could also encourage receiving countries to adopt fixed (or less flexible) exchange-rate regimes. On the other hand, pro-cyclical flows may create an amplification effect of upturns or downturns in the receiving economy. There is an extant literature dedicated to exploring the cyclical nature of remittances. In general, the results tend to be country-specific and show that, for some migration and remittance corridors, remittances are counter-cyclical while, for others, they are pro-cyclical. This paper argues that the cyclical nature of remittances must be evaluated in a dynamic framework and that the relationship (between remittances and the receiving economy) is unlikely to be stable over time. Using data from Mexico, we show that remittances are counter-cyclical during some periods, but pro-cyclical at others. The changing cyclical nature of remittances questions the potential of remittances to smooth out cyclical fluctuations in output. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","Business Cycles; Financial Crisis; Mexico; Remittances","Mexico [North America]; business cycle; economic policy; exchange rate; financial crisis; migrants remittance; migration","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84890786192"

Other trends include a growing concentration of state social welfare budgets around medical assistance, declines in federal assistance to states, and growing differences in social service spending across states of different fiscal capacities.

We then use this typology to identify key trends in the field since 1951, including the sharp downturn in work focusing on economic aspects of change after 1985, the decline of grand narratives of social change since 2000 and the parallel return to media effects. We conclude by outlining the key traits of a processual approach to social change, which has the capacity to offer the basis for shared language in the field.

Description: The increased health needs related to the ageing society and epidemiological patterns in these countries also require funding needs to increase, rationing to be reformed, sectors to be integrated (the managed care approach), and an analytical information base to be developed if supervision of new technological approaches is to improve. The period of system transitions in CEE countries entailed significant changes in their health systems, including health care financing. Discussion: Large deficits in the public financing of health systems were just one of the challenges arising from the economic downturn of the 1990s, which was coupled with inflation, increasing unemployment, low salaries, a large informal sector and tax evasion in a number of CEE countries. During the communist period, there was universal access to a wide range of health services, proving it difficult to retain this coverage. As a result, many states sought to ration publicly funded health services – for example, through patient cost-sharing or decreasing the scope of basic benefits. Yet, not all of these reform plans were implemented, and in fact, some were rolled back or not implemented at all due to a lack of social or political consensus. Conclusion: CEE health systems had come to practice implicit rationing in the form of under-the-table payments from patients, quasi-formal payments to providers to compensate for lack of funding, and long waiting lists forcing patients to the private sector. All these difficulties pose a challenge to the implementation of integrated care. © 2021 The Author(s).","Central and Eastern Europe; Health care; Implementation; Integrated care; Social care","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85119139298"

While recently some work has begun to explore doctoral attrition qualitatively, the purpose of this study is to describe current trends in graduate engineering students' consideration of departure from their programs of study by capturing current numerical data specific to engineering about students' recent attrition considerations. This is important because, since the last studies were conducted, higher education systems have experienced a global pandemic, economic downturn, and sociopolitical turmoil in the United States. Graduate students (n = 2204) in the U.S. completed a survey. The sample includes master's (n = 535) and doctorate (n = 1646) degree-seeking students from 27 engineering disciplines and includes U.S. domestic and international populations. A majority of students considered leaving their degree program in the month before they took the survey: nearly 70% of Ph.D. and 39% of master's students, while 31% of Ph.D. and 16% of master's students seriously considered leaving their program without their degree. Descriptive statistics provide early departure considerations by engineering discipline, gender identity, race/ethnicity, nationality, and year in program by degree sought. Comparisons between groups are presented for gender, nationality, and career stage. It is essential to have an updated and discipline-specific benchmark of attrition considerations for continued engineering education research purposes, for mentorship, and for administrative purposes. Early departure from graduate school remains a threat to innovation and broadening participation in engineering and the professoriate. © 2023 Tempus Publications.

Recession-induced job losses and changes in shares of parttime and fulltime employment significantly varied across demographic groups and gender. From 1989 to 1991 males experienced a larger decline than females in the relative shares of fulltime employment with Mexican-American and other Hispanic females actually increasing their shares. Utilizing 1990 and 1992 CPS data, we estimate bivariate probit models of employment and fulltime/parttime employment status for each group. These employment and work status probabilities are then decomposed to analyse the factors that led to the changes. Our study suggests that the 1990-91 recession-induced labour market changes had the most detrimental impact on black male and non-Hispanic white female workers. As such, public policies implemented to mitigate the impact of economic downturns should take into account the differential impact of economic recessions on demographic groups.","","United States; demographic trend; employment; gender disparity; labor market; racial disparity","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0032463835"

Did Obama create such high expectations that they actually hindered his ability to enact his agenda? Should we judge his performance by the scale of the expectations his rhetoric generated, or against some other standard? The Rhetoric of Heroic Expectations: Establishing the Obama Presidency grapples with these and other important questions. Barack Obama’s election seemed to many to fulfill Martin Luther King Jr.’s vision of the “long arc of the moral universe . . . bending toward justice.” And after the terrorism, war, and economic downturn of the previous decade, candidate Obama’s rhetoric cast broad visions of a change in the direction of American life. In these and other ways, the election of 2008 presented an especially strong example of creating expectations that would shape the public’s views of the incoming administration. The public’s high expectations, in turn, become a part of any president’s burden upon assuming office. The interdisciplinary scholars who have contributed to this volume focus their analysis upon three kinds of presidential burdens: Institutional burdens (specific to the office of the presidency); contextual burdens (specific to the historical moment within which the president assumes office); and personal burdens (specific to the individual who becomes president). © 2014 by Texas A&M University Press.

The second phase is the so-called sovereign debt crisis which started in Greece firstly and then appeared in Ireland and Portugal. Like many other countries and organizations, European Union (EU) has also developed strategies in order to tackle the challenges of the crisis. This paper attempted to investigate the strategic initiatives of EU for the economic recovery in Europe. The results of this investigation show that EU's recovery strategies have been executed in two ways: the preservation of Member States' financial stability and the enhancement of economic governance inside EU. Nevertheless the lack of a political union, in particular the supranational governance of economy policy is delaying the recovery of the EU's economy and causing the contagion of sovereign debt problems in Member States of euro. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","European Union; Global financial crisis; Recovery strategies; Sovereign debt crisis","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-80955182274"

Italy has, in fact, been hit particularly severely by the international crisis, which has induced a sharp decline in employment and a narrowing of the productive base. That said, we know very little about the strategies used by Italian entrepreneurs to cope with the economic downturn, especially the more innovative ones. To address this topic, the author has used a sample of over 400 Italian companies with European patents in the sectors of mechanical engineering and high technology (European Patent Office (EPO) companies), which were investigated by means of a panel survey: a longitudinal study carried out on the same companies at different times (2010 and 2012). The analysis conducted in this article has two main goals: (1) to describe the socio-economic and territorial characteristics of EPO companies and their strategies in the years of the crisis and (2) to examine the influence of a ‘collaborative corporate culture’ on company performance. What emerges from the research into EPO companies is the complementarity of resources useful for innovation and economic performance among (a) the internal and external relations of the organization; (b) the variety of knowledge and the cohesion of relationships and (c) the short and long networks of collaboration. In conclusion, successful company strategies are those which–thanks to a collaborative company culture–are able to exploit the ‘embedded complementarity of innovative resources’. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","collaborative corporate culture; company’s strategies during the economic crisis; Innovative companies; Italy","Italy; culture; employment; entrepreneur; financial crisis; high technology industry; innovation; manufacturing; survey","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85019084297"

The aim of this paper is to document state, system, and social differences in the recent downturn in school completion rates in Australia. Data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics and from the Australian Youth Survey are used to look at patterns across states, school systems, geographical locations, social backgrounds, and by sex. The results suggest that during the 1990s the downturn in completion has been uneven and some groups of users which had come to rely on schooling during the 1980s for their future economic security are now turning away from school.

This volume presents an in-depth analysis of the effects of these changes on employment in the region. Chapters are devoted to market restructuring in China and Vietnam, the Asian crisis and recovery, and Japan's business doldrums.

Using a novel data set on 11 Central and Eastern European countries from 1990 until 2012, I test competing hypotheses derived from delegation theory, communist legacies approach, technocratic populism studies, and semi-presidentialism literature. The first study shows that experts without political experience (technocrats) have specific cabinet appointment patterns distinguishing them from party politicians and politically experienced experts. For example, technocrats have high chances of being appointed during an economic downturn. The conditional risk set survival analysis has revealed that compared to their politically experienced colleagues, technocrats have higher chances of remaining in their positions if there was a change in the PM’s candidacy. Moreover, they have long careers independently of the continuity of the PM’s party in government and the PM’s partisan status. Strikingly, patterns of portfolio specialization from the communist period remained in place after the regime change (e.g., expert ministers holding the portfolios of finance and economy). However, holding these specific portfolios does not decrease the minister’s risk of being dismissed. These findings have ramifications for issues surrounding cabinet formation, institutional choice, and populism in new democracies. © 2020 by the author; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Communist legacies; Economic crisis; Politically experienced experts; Post-communism; Semi-presidentialism; Technocracy; Technocratic populism","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85099341746"

The financial crisis ended a period of overall global economic growth and price stability during which globalization and its principles of trade, economic and political liberalization were widely held as the emerging international economic and political order. In domestic economy, most countries favored supply-side economics and monetary policy in a free-market setting. This paper appeals to economic logic and empirical evidence to critically study external and internal economic processes and policies particularly of major world economies to identify what caused the unanticipated onset of the banking crash and why the ensuing persistent downturn defied remedial measures. It concludes that major trading powers departed from their declared commitment to free trade and its basic rules with no effective institutional safeguards and deterrents. Internally, absence of efficient monitoring and supervi-sion of workings of nominal and real sectors allowed anomalies to develop within the market economy unnoticed. As regards inefficacy of policies against several years of stagnation, the paper discusses asymmetric performance of monetary tools and problematic application of fiscal policy to suggest revisiting supply-side and Keynesian approaches against their past performance and forge an eclectic kit of analytical and policy tools alongside the necessary organizational reforms. © 2021, University of Economics and Human Sciences in Warsaw.

It has been argued that the singularity of the late 2000 crises arises from non-precedent components, such as globalization and a dominant financial system equipped with exotic instruments (e.g., derivatives) designed from highly specialized mathematical theories. This paper uses the historic (1928-2010) Dow Jones index analyzed with informational entropy methods to show the presence of recurrent cycles with dominant periods of 4.5 and 22. years. For time series, entropy is a measure of the diversity of patterns for given time scales. In this form, the higher the entropy, the more complex the underlying system dynamics. It is shown that the present economic downturn coincides with the occurrence of a 22-year cycle in the entropy dynamics of the Dow Jones index. It suggests that the crisis is not singular, but its origin can be also explained from recurrent long-term patterns. Implications of the empirical results for the evolution of the late 2000 crisis and the potential aftermath courses of the global economy are discussed. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.","Dow Jones index; Economic recessions; Multiscale entropy pattern","Military operations; Time series; Dow Jones; Economic crisis; Economic downturn; Economic recessions; Empirical results; Entropy analysis; Financial system; Global economics; Global economies; Informational entropy; Mathematical theory; Multiscale entropy pattern; Time-scales; Underlying systems; World war II; economic conditions; empirical analysis; financial crisis; global economy; globalization; Entropy","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-80053190897"

The financial implications of the global macroeconomic imbalances that have persisted and enabled the housing bubble to develop with the spread of toxic mortgage-backed securities first became apparent in September and October 2008 with the collapse of major investment banks and mortgage loan institutions, and the credit freeze and the panic that ensued in global equity markets. This paper provides a summary of these events and the transmission of the crisis from the United States to United Kingdom, the eurozone, other industrial economies, emerging markets, and developing Asia. Financial and real economy effects of the crisis on Asia and various channels of transmission of the crisis are evaluated in some detail. In general, financial institutions, particularly commercial banks in developing Asia are well prepared to cope with this crisis as a result of reforms undertaken in response to the Asian crisis of a decade ago, and the fact that Asia has accumulated vast foreign exchange reserves through persistent current account surpluses. Still the real economy effects of the global downturn are likely to be severe. A major deterioration in economic growth in developing Asia in both the current and the coming year is in the cards. Growth in world trade is likely to stall making it difficult for export-oriented economies in the region to continue rapid growth fueled by external demand. Rebalancing Asia's growth toward domestic demand led by consumption, infrastructure investment, and improved health and social security programs will be important in cushioning the impact of the recession taking place in the industrial economies. This paper sets the context for the Asian Development Outlook 2009 with an emphasis on rebalancing growth in developing Asia and, by implication, the world economy. © 2008 by Asian Development Bank.","","Asia; United Kingdom; United States; banking; developing world; development economics; economic growth; equity; financial crisis; financial market; financial system; global economy; macroeconomics","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-77949401128"

Methods: This research draws from multiple state-level data sources to construct a panel data set from 1992 to 2010. Results: Disaster damage, relief funds, and politics all influence the usage of states’ RDFs. We also find that the RDF balance is lower when disaster damages increase, when it is an election year, and the same party holds party control of the governor and legislature. Conclusion: The findings of this empirical research are consistent with the literature about the importance state-level politics plays in the use of state stabilization funds intended for cyclical economic downturns as opposed to providing more politically expedient disaster relief. © 2019 by the Southwestern Social Science Association","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85065733707"

Increased demand leads to overpricing of and ensuing lower returns to lottery-like stocks. Other proxies for extreme returns, such as idiosyncratic volatility and skewness, play a much weaker role (if any) as cross-sectional determinants of stock performance.

Five economic political models developed as the Nordic area was integrated into the postwar world economy. They emerged as the Nordic countries — on the basis of their specific geo-economic and political-institutional conditions — emulated the Fordist growth model, which originated in the US. The downturn of the Western world economy was a crisis for the Fordist mass consumption/mass production model. We trace the consequences of this crisis for the Nordic models. Policy makers first tried to maintain the established routines of the 1960s, but failed, fumbled and finally turned to more austere, neo liberal economic policies. As a result, there seems to be a certain convergence between the five models, a specific Nordic version of neo-liberalism. Despite this, we doubt that continued neoliberal policies will prove able to cope with the challenges that the Nordic countries face as the world heads into the 1990s. Neoliberal policies aim to promote flexibility by reducing the impact of the state, by liberalizing labour markets and by relying on full integration within the world economy. Alternatively, we argue in our last section that policies should aim to promote flexible specialization by making the welfare state a comparative advantage in connection with industrial policies, by extending efforts at democratization of decisions concerning labour process organ ization and work environment, and by stimulating Nordic integration. © 1987, Sage Publications.

Alternatively, the “encouraged worker” thesis predicts that economic downturns steer individuals away from education because of higher opportunity costs. This study provides a formal test of these opposing theories using data from the United States compared with similar sources from the United Kingdom, Germany, and Sweden. I investigate whether macroeconomic stimuli—including recessions and youth unemployment fluctuations—matter for enrollment decisions. Analyses rely on 10 years of detailed individual-level panel data, consisting of birth cohorts across several decades. Across data sources, results show enrollment persistence in secondary education is stronger in response to economic downturns. These patterns differ sharply for tertiary-enrolled students and those who recently left higher education. Surprisingly, U.S. youths display an increased hazard of school leaving and a decreased hazard of educational reenrollment in response to adverse conditions. In contrast, European youths tend to make enrollment decisions supportive of discouraged-worker mechanisms or insensitivity to adverse conditions. The U.S.-specific encouraged-worker mechanism might be explained by the relative importance of market forces in one’s early career and the high costs of university attendance, which induces risk aversion with regard to educational investment. The discussion addresses the consequences for educational inequality. © The Author(s) 2020.","countercyclicality; discouraged worker; higher education; labor market effects on education; macroeconomic conditions; persistence; recession; reenrollment; school leaving; youth unemployment","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85091457404"

This is especially the case in a downturn, where low or even negative interest rates often provide incentives for debt managers to invest predominantly in short-term bonds. Our findings echo the post-crisis environment of low or even negative interest rates, where many debt managers altered their portfolios’ structure in favor of short-term bonds.

The crisis has had disproportionate impacts on social and economic rights and well-being of specific groups of people, in particular, women and children, migrants and minorities.

The transition from high to low mortality and fertility rates has made the eventual stabilization of the world's population a real possibility. The demographic success of Asia is associated with the stunning economic and social changes that have taken place during this period. Aside from social and economic improvements, population and health policies also played a major part in shaping the region's demographic transformation. National programs made a substantial contribution to increasing contraceptive use, lowering fertility, and slowing population growth. The success of family planning programs was frequently supported by positive changes in the demand for children. As the initial impact of the recent financial and economic crisis has shown, the Asian demographic miracle cannot be taken for granted. Since mid-1997, the crisis has interrupted and reversed the region's remarkable development gains. Economic downturns often tend to affect the social sectors unevenly. Strengthening the provision of basic social services, including reproductive health and care of the elderly, particularly in poor nations, will remain a challenge in the next century. The establishment of goals, including in areas such as HIV/AIDS, will help Asian countries realize the vision of the International Conference on Population and Development¿s 20-year Programme of Action.","","Asia; Birth Rate; Delivery of Health Care; Demography; Developing Countries; Evaluation Studies; Family Planning Services; Fertility; Health; Health Planning; Health Services; Mortality; Population; Population Dynamics; Reproductive Medicine; Asia; Critique; Delivery Of Health Care; Demographic Factors; Demographic Transition; Developing Countries; Family Planning; Family Planning Programs; Fertility; Fertility Decline; Health; Health Services; Mortality; Mortality Decline; Population; Population Dynamics; Reproductive Health; article; Asia; birth rate; Critique; Demographic Factors; Demographic Transition; demography; developing country; evaluation; family planning; Family Planning Programs; fertility; Fertility Decline; health; health care delivery; health care planning; health service; mortality; Mortality Decline; population; population dynamics; reproduction; reproductive health","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0033286576"

It investigates, in particular, changes in self-reported difficulties in accessing healthcare with regard to distance to health services, waiting times for appointments and the costs of seeing a doctor, and identifies particular risk factors that increase the likelihood of facing barriers in accessing health services. We conduct logistic regression analyses of cross-sectional data from the three rounds (2003, 2007, 2011) of the European Quality of Life Survey of 2682 individuals living in private households in Ireland. The study finds that the number of individuals reporting difficulties in accessing healthcare increased over time. Of particular concern are difficulties with the financial costs of covering doctor’s appointments, which started to increase dramatically prior to the economic crisis and continued to rise during the crisis, in particular for higher income groups. Difficulties with distance and waiting time declined gradually over time and appear unaffected by the financial crisis, at least until 2011.

Social service organizations must be equipped with a systematic means of understanding and managing their organizational knowledge needs in this digital era so as to surmount these challenges. Knowledge management (KM), which has been practiced since the 1980s, is considered one possible solution; a knowledge audit, usually the first phase of a KM project, can reveal an organization's knowledge needs, strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and risks. This article presents a systematic knowledge audit approach and describes its implementation in a social service organization in Hong Kong. The knowledge audit process was conducted for a suicide prevention organization-the Samaritan Befrienders Hong Kong. The audit is also the first phase of an action research project on KM collaboratively conducted by the Department of Applied Social Sciences and the Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University. A knowledge-based case library was established after the audit to facilitate access to, and sharing of, case management information among social workers in the. In this article, the background of the project, and the concepts of knowledge management and knowledge audit are discussed.

Using annual bank data from 2008 to 2016, this paper analyzes the effect of state ownership and business models on the financial and funding stability of banks in the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU). We report that state ownership is strongly associated with a lower likelihood of bank defaults and mitigates the destabilizing effect of sanctions. Private banks, however, experience negative impacts of sanctions on their financial stability. In terms of business models, the financial stability of the bank deteriorates with larger size and lending growth but improves with greater short-term borrowing and capitalization. We also provide evidence that the funding stability of EAEU banks, measured by the Basel III Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR), does not depend on state ownership. Moreover, the funding liquidity of the Russian and Belarusian banks were negatively affected by sanctions, whereas there was no effect of sanctions on Kazakhstani banks’ NSFR. Overall, enhanced capitalization and less reliance on short-term borrowing improve the weak structural liquidity of EAEU banks. © 2018 Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois","Business models; Kazakhstan; NSFR; Russia; Sanctions; State ownership","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85051125463"

Although it is often argued that the increasing intensity of globalization has led to such a decline in the industrialized states, the paper finds that there has been little, if any, downturn in either levels of state expenditure in general or in levels of welfare spending in particular. However, the experience of the developing states has been rather different. In their case, the last few decades indicate that stagnation or a decline in welfare spending has occurred, particularly during the period of structural adjustment implementation. It is argued that the OECD countries still manage to provide a high level of social welfare to their populations that closely resembles the compensatory state model. In contradistinction, many of the states in the South have struggled to maintain their levels of social expenditure and therefore most resemble Cerny's competitive state model. In order to explain these two divergent outcomes, the paper examines the way in which the behaviour of certain key international financial actors (investors, multinational companies, international financial institutions) differs with regard to these two sets of countries. © 2009 SAGE Publications.","Capital taxation; Compensatory state; Competitive state; Developing states; Globalization; Industrialized countries; Industrializing states; Welfare spending","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-62549125032"

Australia's experience was, however, broadly similar to those of countries such as Canada and Argentina which also had a high dependence on exports and external funds. There has been a continuing debate over the relative importance of external and internal factors in causing and increasing the depth of the depression in Australia. There is little disagreement that the downturn in the world economy was translated to Australia by falling export prices and sales and by a cessation of foreign lending. It has been argued, however, that unfavorable domestic factors would have caused a marked downturn in any case and thus also contributed to the severity of the depression. These domestic factors were structural problems in the Australian economy created by the high level of tariff protection; the rate of growth of money wage rates in the 1920s; and a slowdown in public investment. These views are tested by simulating a macroeconometric model of the Australian economy in the interwar years. The results indicate that export prices were the major influence in initiating and determining the depth of the depression in Australia. Other factors were of secondary importance. Indeed, the depression can be viewed as an unusual economic fluctuation imposed on Australia's normal business cycle from overseas sources. © 1987.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-38249038269"

Design/methodology/approach: This study adopts an interpretative approach. This paper used semi-structured interviews with 2 finance directors and 13 top managers for data collection. This paper used thematic analysis for analysing the interview data. Findings: The study findings suggest that the traditional ways of managing working capital may no longer be sufficient during a crisis. Instead, dynamic financing, trade credit policy and continuous staff training to develop new skills are alternative WCM practices to navigate the challenges of a crisis. Further, this paper finds that economic conditions, such as inflation rates, interest rates, exchange rates and government policy, negatively affect WCM. Practical implications: The study findings highlight practical issues that may help firms meet their present and future financing needs, manage their day-to-day operational activities and enhance performance, both operational and financial. The study is beneficial for regulators in understanding a firm’s constraints during crises and respond appropriately.

Whilst such activities would have gendered implications, such proposals often do not consider the gendered contexts in which entrepreneurship is placed, nor how this form of entrepreneurship works for the women involved. The article draws on in-depth narrative interviews with women in fishing families in England and Wales who have started, initiated or explored entrepreneurial opportunities to examine (i) whether entrepreneurship enables a (re)negotiation of gender relations within families and (ii) how entrepreneurship develops over the lifecourse. The research is conceptually framed through the literature on women's ‘entrepreneurship’, family embedded perspectives of entrepreneurship, ‘Mumpreneurship’ combined with a lifecourse approach. I found that although women's traditional invisibility often became reproduced through their entrepreneurship in fishing family contexts, women's fisheries entrepreneurship challenged traditional gender relations. In becoming entrepreneurs women negotiated their entrepreneurship with other gendered roles, such as motherhood, over the lifecourse. I argue that shifting the discourse from fisheries diversification to entrepreneurship make it possible to take women seriously by fully viewing them as fisheries workers in their own right in both research and policy. © 2021 European Society for Rural Sociology","entrepreneurs; entrepreneurship; fisheries; fishing families; gender; women","England; United Kingdom; Wales; entrepreneur; fishery economics; fishery production; gender identity; gender relations; womens employment; womens status","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85109138384"

It contrasts the “middle class squeeze” view that sees the “middle” or the “middling classes” as particularly hard hit by the economic downturn with the class theoretical point of view that the recession is expected to widen the gaps between classes with regard to their ability to maintain living standards and that working, not middle classes bear the largest strain on economic wellbeing. The study derives competing hypotheses from these views and tests them using data from the Irish leg of the European Social Survey.

The findings reveal higher levels of spline conditional volatility during the Covid-19 Crisis, providing novel evidence of the correlation between this pandemic and other major crises. Through the NIPALS algorithm, we identify 13 primary components that show a correlation between historical crises and the Covid-19 Crisis. In contrast, PLS-2 regressions indicate a strong correlation between historical crises and the Covid-19 Crisis in only six principal components.

Through comparative analysis, the study shows under which shock an indicator was trending downwards, upwards, or stable – on average. The study found that relative to the other shocks, cocoa and gold prices increased most under the GFC, and therefore, their exports were also averagely more favourable under the GFC, but timber exports and oil and gas imports were trending downwards. Exports of timber and timber products and imports of oil and gas increased under the COVID-19 shock but gold export and trade balance declined, on average, during the COVID-19 shock. Exchange rate, oil and gas prices, and food and non-food inflation were found to have been unprecedently high during the Russian-Ukraine war compared with all other shocks, and this reflects the worst record of economic growth during the Russian-Ukraine war compared with all other shocks.

With no immediate prospect of a reversal in this disturbing trend and the likelihood that the continuation of high rates of unemployment in the future represents evidence not only of a sustained cyclical downturn in economic activity, but is also symptomatic of structural changes in the economy as a result of technological developments, it is becoming increasingly relevant to examine the contemporary influence of work, unemployment and leisure on personal well-being.

It offers an examination of the impact of job deprivation and the meaning of work, the availability of meaningful alternatives to employment and the acceptance by the long-term unemployed in particular, and society in general, of enforced leisure time. © 1983 E. and F.N.

We show that a given level of pay-for-performance incentives results in significantly lower firm risk when the economy is in a downturn.

It asserts that the eastern expansion of the EU occurred within the context of the historically uneven development between Eastern and Western Europe. This was temporarily disguised by the positive socio-economic performance of the new EU states, following their entry into the EU. This gave credence to the rationalist assertion that EU expansion was in the interests of all the EU countries and in particular benefited the new member states from Central-Eastern Europe (CEE). Growing imbalances within the CEE economies have been exposed by the global economic crisis, with the new eastern economies suffering the most during the downturn. A contradiction of this situation is that EU membership provides the CEE economies some form of protection in the world economy. Also, these countries have often been at the forefront of supporting further European integration in recent years. It is therefore likely that the CEE states will be most supportive of deepening Europes policies of integration and convergence, with some of the richer Western European countries seeking their restriction. © 2011 University of Kent.","","Central Europe; Eastern Europe; economic integration; economic policy; European Union; financial crisis; global economy; regional economy; socioeconomic impact","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-79957505695"

Using a panel dataset of all the county governments in Florida from 2007 to 2011, this study examines the factors that affect the size of unreserved fund balances and empirically tests the spatial effects concerning local fund balance policies in Florida.

Responding to the economic downturn, some governments have declared a “green new deal” to remedy unemployment and the economic crisis. Job creation has been suggested as a driving force for sustainable economic development and climate change action. However, the question of how many and what types of green jobs are required has not been systematically examined. Are green job openings and searches matching each other in terms of timing, sectors, regions, and salary? This study aims to explore the degree of matching between green job supply and demand using a big data analysis (BDA) of online job market recruiting services in South Korea from 2009 to 2020. The BDA of the Ecojob website reveals that green jobs are concentrated in Seoul and Gyeounggi‐do metropolitan areas. The number of water‐ and air‐quality‐related jobs is high within these sectors. Job searches in the water quality sector outnumbered job openings. The findings imply that green job creation policy should reflect timing, regional, and sectoral demand and supply data. Creating and matching green jobs is expected to reduce environmental harm, enhance environmental quality, and reduce unemployment. © 2021 by the authors.

However, human capital accumulation is more counter-cyclical for young and low-productivity individuals because they face a lower opportunity cost of education and a higher marginal product of human capital. These results are confirmed empirically using US data from the Current Population Survey and the American Time Use Survey. In addition, the paper contributes to the RBC literature by showing that the model[U+05F3]s business cycle properties, in particular hours worked volatility, are sensitive to assumptions of heterogeneity.

We use two regional payroll tax cuts in Finland as well as the onset of the Great Recession to estimate the effect of the recession on firms treated by the payroll tax cuts compared to a similar control group. When implemented, prior to the Great Recession, we estimate that the payroll tax cuts had limited effects on employment and balance-sheet outcomes of firms located in the treated regions. However, when the recession starts, some of its negative effects were substantially hampered by the previously enacted payroll tax cuts in treated firms. These employment effects are exacerbated for men and low-skilled employees. We also find that sales and profits in treated firms respond differently in treated firms during the recession. We provide some evidence showing that firms that are liquidity constrained are the ones that exhibit the strongest response. This shows that payroll tax cuts can make firms more resilient during downturns, possibly by relaxing liquidity constraints. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Employment; Firms; Fiscal multipliers; Great recession; Labor costs; Payroll taxes; Place-based policies; Wages","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85110210069"

Main benefits from coal mining at national level include exports, government royalty, employment, and income. At regional level, coal mining can increase stress not only on the environment but also on public services, housing, and job markets. Little is known on whether coal mining brought positive changes to the regions over time. This paper examines selected socio-economic indicators between coal mining and non-mining local government areas (LGAs) in Queensland, Australia. This study differs from other research in three important ways. First, this study is focusing on coal mining activities, instead of the overall mining sector, and focusing on regional Queensland. Coal mining is the largest contributor to the total direct expenditure of the minerals and energy sector in Queensland. By limiting the observations to LGA level in one state, which is Queensland, this study has advantage of fewer confounding factors that are correlated with each other such as institution and political environment. Second, this study examines the effect of coal mining through the business cycle of expansion, downturn, and recovery by employing census time-series data for about one decade, starting 2006 up to 2016. Therefore, this study provides a better understanding of the effect of coal mining over time.

The findings cast some doubt on the proposition that the current stagnation of many developed countries is due to a lack of innovation and investment opportunities. Our data show that Finland catches up to, and passes, Sweden in innovation output in the 1990s. In per capita terms, Finland stays ahead throughout the period.

In doing so, mainstream economists deliberately overlook the asymmetric characteristics of the international monetary system and the persisting hegemony of dollar. Raul Prebisch’s pioneering work on business cycles in Latin America provide an alternative view, one capable of amending the existing mainstream literature. On the one hand, Prebisch stressed the destabilizing role of capital inflows on Latin American economies, particularly short-term speculative capital. On the other hand, Prebisch designed a set of counter cyclical monetary policies in order to contrast capital volatility, particularly during downturns. An analysis of stylized facts shows that, when correctly updated, Prebisch’s theory has remarkable explanatory potential when applied to Latin America’s current economic and financial situation. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Capital flows; currency hierarchy; liquidity cycle; new institutional economics; Raul Prebisch","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097816764"

This illuminating and provocative work shows that it is the rapid expansion of private rather than public debt that constrains growth and sparks economic calamities like the financial crisis of 2008. Relying on the findings of a team of economists, credit expert Richard Vague argues that the Great Depression of the 1930s, the economic collapse of the past decade, and many other sharp downturns around the world were all preceded by a spike in privately held debt. Vague presents an algorithm for predicting crises and argues that China may soon face disaster. Since American debt levels have not declined significantly since 2008, Vague believes that economic growth in the United States will suffer unless banks embrace a policy of debt restructuring.

Largely ignored, however, is that this contraction was easily predicted on the basis of a well-established pattern of land speculation, premature subdivision, and excessive building on marginal land that recurs approximately once every 18 years. Capital locked up in projects that are started during a land bubble is effectively lost during the downturn, leaving the nation without sufficient capital to finance ordinary business operations during the recovery period. The best instrument for avoiding this boom-bust cycle is the property tax and, more specifically, the portion that falls on land. We explore here the ways in which the property tax influences the intensity, timing, and location of development. We also examine why frequent and accurate assessment are essential to make the property tax an effective method of preventing speculative real estate bubbles. © 2009 American Journal of Economics and Sociology, Inc.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-70349484955"

Pegged regimes work best for emerging market economies while crawling regimes deliver the greatest boost to economic growth in the G20.

Conditions for these explanations to be valid are formulated and tested with data about the development of defense spending, the U.S. economy, the business cycle, and fiscal policy, as well as an analysis of the Economic Reports and of secondary sources about U.S. defense and economic policies. All three economic explanations are considered inadequate. It is true that defense cuts have sometimes aggravated a recession, and that on other occasions defense has served as a cushion, or even worked more strongly anticyclically, when foreign policy crises occurred at the time of economic downturns. It is also true that military expenditures have played a role in fiscal policy. However, there have been economic reasons for increases and for cuts in the defense budget, and the amounts involved are rather small in absolute or relative terms. Defense is an important, but not the decisive factor in the U.S. business cycle; its weight has decreased substantially. There has been even no absolute growth in U.S. defense spending since the early fifties (in constant prices), and some absolute indicators have declined. Mostly, changes in U.S. military expenditures can and can only be explained by international and foreign/defense policy developments and considerations. These factors should be taken much more seriously. © 1981, Sage Publications. All rights reserved.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84970442207"

This paper argues that the deterioration of relations between Russia and the West from the euphoria of the early 1990s to the confrontation of today stems from two interrelated developments. The first is the West’s commitment to expand the liberal international order eastwards by incorporating large segments of the former Soviet empire via the exportation of liberal economic and political values along with the enlargement of both NATO and the European Union. The second development that led to the downturn in Russia’s relations with the West is the change in Russia’s strategic culture in a more assertive and aggressive direction. This change is partly a response to the West’s expansion into the post-Soviet space, and partly a response to internal threats to the political system that President Putin and his associates have created. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","East-West confrontation; liberal world order; Russian strategic culture","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85057297806"

Design/Methodology/Approach - The analysis relies on the Croatian Community Innovation Survey 2010 (CIS 2010) data. To fi nd out whether innovations have a diff erent pattern of drivers in manufacturing and in services, we estimate the probit and multivariate probit models separately on these two groups of fi rms. Findings and implications - The fi ndings reveal that, despite some diff erences, service and manufacturing SMEs are not that diff erent from one another when it comes to innovation activities. Service SMEs are somewhat less likely to introduce technological innovations, but manufacturing and service SMEs do not diff er signifi cantly when it comes to non-Technological innovations. One noteworthy diff erence between manufacturing and service SMEs is that the latter rely on acquired knowledge much more than do the former. Limitations - One limitation of the study is that most variables in the CIS dataset, including those on inno- vations, are of a binary nature, a fact that dictated the choice of the econometric model. In addition, the data pertain to the time period of an economic downturn in Croatia, which possibly aff ected the results obtained. Originality - This research contributes to understanding the drivers of innovation activities in SMEs and differences in this regard between manufacturing and services in Croatia.","Croatia; Innovation; Manufacturing; Multivariate probit; Services; SME","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85017139232"

We find that while gold returns are not co-integrated with stock returns and bond returns, gold returns have a unidirectional causality with both of them. Also, we discover that gold returns have some predictive power on subsequent short-term stock returns. Under extreme market scenarios, it turns out that gold returns tend to deteriorate more simultaneously with bond returns than stock returns.

In 'reading' life on the estate against economic decline and regeneration practices, I aim to show why the latter cannot really succeed because they are premised on (a) a failure to understand the situation of the socially excluded and (b) injustices and inequalities hard-wired into the very form of late capitalism itself. In light of this thesis, my claim is that only large-scale changes to the neo-liberal socio-economic system will save Hull, and as a consequence, the people of Bransholme, because only this will oppose the 'winner takes all', exclusive neo-liberal politics Meagher discusses in her 2009 work on 'urbs sacra' and 'rurban America' and offer hope for some kind of spatial justice. In order to reach this conclusion, I divide my paper into three sections. First, I explore recession, decline, dislocation and the socio-economic condition of the city. Second, I consider regeneration as discourse and offer some theoretical considerations towards the development of what I call 'the language game of post-Thatcherite hyper-rational utopianism' which constructs the de-industrialised city as a business to be saved through the advance of market principles. Finally, I turn to thinking about life on the estate through reference to my own ethnographic observations in order to suggest that the condition of the excluded is not somehow a natural state, but rather an effect of their immersion in a temporal and spatial environment, which has been destroyed by market forces premised on the objectivity of processes such as creative destruction. Thus, I explore 'Being-in-Hull' and 'Being-on-Bransholme' in terms of notions of territoriality, marginality and what I call 'the culture of despair' in contemporary working-class life. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","alienation; Hull; inequality; neo-liberalism; regeneration; social housing","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84876046904"

The study has found that stock returns and unstable cryptocurrency returns have high volatility persistence in the long run. Besides, while unstable digital currencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance Coin, and Dogecoin) serve as a hedge during stable economic periods, they have not been a hedge during economic turmoil in the stock markets. Conversely, stablecoins (Tether and USD Coin) have been shown to have acted as a hedge during normal economic times and have offered a safe haven during economic downturns. Except for Tether, all cryptocurrencies' diversification capacity is time-varying. In stable economic conditions, they serve as diversifiers, but during turmoil, they do not. However, Tether serves as a diversifier regardless of the financial situation.

In the model, reserve accumulation depreciates the real exchange rate and attracts foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows, which promotes productivity growth through endogenous firm dynamics. The economy is also subject to sudden stops in the form of an occasionally binding constraint on foreign borrowing, and accumulated reserves are used to prevent severe economic downturns. The model shows that two factors are the key determinants of the optimal pace of reserve accumulation: the elasticity of the foreign borrowing spread with respect to foreign debt and the entry cost for FDI. The model suggests that these two factors can explain a substantial amount of the cross-country variation in the observed pace of reserve accumulation. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Endogenous growth; Foreign direct investment; Foreign reserve accumulation; Gross capital flows; Real exchange rate; Sudden stops","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85101169582"

However, detailed discussions on the impact of digital finance on green development remain scant among scholars. To address this gap, we first construct a Green Development Index for China. Utilizing provincial panel data from 2011 to 2019, we aim to evaluate the influence of digital finance on green development. Additionally, our research aimed to ascertain the ‘rebound’ effect of digital finance on green development, especially in terms of volatility. The results show that the development of digital finance has a positive impact on green development, but this impact is asymmetric, mainly exhibiting regional disparities and threshold effects. Moreover, digital finance can effectively suppress consumption volatility and the negative impact of green financial shocks on green development. Importantly, the smoothing effect of digital finance is particularly pronounced during downturn phases of the financial cycle. Further examination revealed the moderating roles of educational attainment, economic structure, R&D, and governmental intervention. Our findings underscore the pressing need for governmental authorities to prioritize economic transformation and R&D activities to amplify the synergistic benefits between digital finance and green growth. Concurrently, it's essential for governments to carefully evaluate their fiscal policies to ensure they do not inadvertently obstruct the path to sustainable green development. © 2023 The Authors","Consumption volatility; Digital financial development; Green credit volatility; Green economy","Economic and social effects; Economics; Consumption volatility; Digital financial development; Financial development; Green credit volatility; Green credits; Green economies; Panel data; Rebound-effect; Regional disparities; Threshold effect; Finance","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85180413114"

Thus, countries with greater transparency (less corruption) are more likely to make credit decisions based on market-wide forces rather than succumb to the influence of special interest groups.

Allegedly, the reason is that when business sees that the government balance sheet is improving-and public debt declining-there will be greater confidence in the country's economic prospects, and this increased confidence will lead to higher investment. This in turn will lead to growth and the road to economic recovery. This study examines the impact of government stance on public debt for 11 OECD countries for which data on the relevant factors are available from 1881 to 2011. Contrary to traditional predictions, it turns out that over this long historical span, fiscal contractions deteriorated rather than improved public debt as a percentage of GDP. This implies that fiscal austerity exacerbates the lack of demand and deteriorates rather than enhances the prospects of economic recovery. © The Author 2015.

This study examines technological transitions in Sweden, 1908–2016, using a new literature-based innovation output indicator for the engineering industry, allowing a mixed-methods approach. The results suggest that waves of innovation have taken place during periods of investment downturns and structural crises during the 1930s, 1970s, and 2010s. Closer examination indicates that landscape pressure alone cannot explain the pattern. Rather, the pattern can be explained by multi-regime interactions: infrastructure and industry rationalization, acting as a fertile ground for breakthrough innovations when the crisis breaks out. The results support a historical interpretation of long-run transitions in terms of development blocks and three industrial revolutions, with implications for the assessment of current sustainable transitions. This suggests a crucial role for infrastructures and interactions between socio-technical systems, not least between digital and renewable energy technology. © 2021 The Author(s)","Development blocks; Innovation; Technological transitions; Wavelet analysis","Sweden; Indicator indicator; alternative energy; economic development; innovation; landscape ecology; sustainability","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85112532227"

Existing EWS models employ aggregated variables that cannot examine the nonlinear dynamics of participating players on scales smaller than a country in unstable, non-equilibrium economies. To help understand the mechanism of financial crises and identify new robust indicators for financial crises and economic recessions, in this work, we take an ""anatomical"" approach, i.e., to examine the income structures of different sectors of an economy separately, as well as to analyze the exposure networks associated with Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac, Lehman Brothers, and American International Group. We show that the losses in exposure networks can be modeled by a two-parameter Omori-law-like distribution for earthquake aftershocks. Such a distribution suggests that losses will be widespread around crises or recessions. Indeed, around crises or recessions, the heavy-tailed distributions for the negative income cluster are even heavier than those for the positive income cluster. Consequently, the entropies associated with the distribution of the negative income cluster exceed that of the positive income cluster. Moreover, instability propagates from the crisis initiating sector to other sectors. Therefore, the anatomical approach developed here can indeed shed some light on the detailed dynamics of financial crises and economic recessions, and the distribution and entropy approaches can help predict economic downturns. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","Distribution analysis; Earthquake; Entropy; Financial crises; Omori's law","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84902075401"

A total of 35 senior managers from the Top 100 Australian construction companies were interviewed. The findings indicate that construction companies, particularly the large ones were not affected in any significant way but are expecting some difficult financial times over the next few years and are taking actions to minimize the upcoming adverse impacts. The most common strategy adopted by Australian construction contractors is to concentrate on core business while avoiding aimless bidding. Similarly, great focus is placed on retaining human resources in order to maintain the skill set so that the company can respond quickly when market conditions improves. The research findings will provide construction contractors with insights on how to establish and sustain competitive advantages during economic slowdown and become more resilient in the future. © 2015 Vilnius Gediminas Technical University (VGTU) Press.","Actions; Australia; Construction contractors; Economic downturn; GFC","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84944274044"

Specifically, the article seeks to focus on describing the TMT's composition, group processes, and work during a period of high external pressure; analysing the TMT's work in terms of an organisational learning process; and discussing factors that may have enabled the TMT to make appropriate strategic decisions during the crisis. Design/methodology/approach: The empirical foundation of this article is a longitudinal case study of a Swedish industrial company during the economic recession of the late 2000s. Data were collected through observations of meetings involving the TMT from 2009 to 2011 and through semi-structured interviews with TMT managers. Findings: Two empirical themes - ""accelerating"" and ""braking"" - illustrate actions taken by the TMT during the crisis. Accelerating involves activities aimed at accelerating the company out of the downturn, whereas braking involves activities aimed at reducing costs. The findings suggest that the TMT exhibited the ability to handle processes of exploration and exploitation during the crisis and that learning occurred at the individual, group, and organisational levels. Practical implications: A practical implication of this study is the importance for TMTs to work simultaneously with processes of exploration and exploitation when fighting to survive an economic crisis and to designate time for learning processes in daily work. Originality/value: The study contributes to the field by empirically showing the processes of organisational learning in practice and by highlighting the relevance of organisational learning research to understanding the performance and work of top management teams in organisations. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Ambidextrous organizations; Economic crisis; Economic cycles; Exploitation; Exploration; Learning; Organizational learning; Senior management; Sweden; Top management team","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84868534349"

Changes are calculated in the real terms using the detailed input-output matrices for representative farms in Poland, for different economic size classes, in the years 2007–2013. Input-output matrices were used for the decomposition of the Hicks-Moorsteen TFP index. The goal is to evaluate changes in the real TFP in the downturn and recovery phases of the business cycle in agriculture. It was found that the reaction of TFP to business cycle changes on “small”, “medium” and even “large” family farms in Poland is diametrically opposite to that observed in the case of large- -scale farms. More than 90% of farms in Poland (except for the largest) increase technical productivity in the conditions of the economic downturn and lower it in the conditions of the economic recovery. Such behaviour is pro-cyclic and irrational, alluding to the 17th-century King’s effect, which is vanishing in the agricultural systems of highly developed countries. The hypothesis is proposed that the size of the price expectation error which causes that effect is negatively correlated with the economic size of the farm, but at the same time it is proportional to the percentage of agricultural income obtained from subsidies and other payments under the SAPS system. © 2017, Agricultural Economics.

The volatility of this economy since the 1980s had suggested the likelihood of a sharp loss of jobs, maybe followed by a strong bounce-back, if the finance sector could overcome reputational damage from its role in the debacle of 2007-2008. In fact this area proved both the most resilient in the downturn and the most dynamic in the upturn, accounting for all or most net job gains in the UK. This article considers three types of explanation for this positive outcome, in terms of: fundamental economic strengths allowing it to keep going through generally tough times; an advantaged position in relation to elite choices about resource allocation and restructuring in the face of a general fiscal/commercial squeeze; and (less conventionally) the impact of massive support to/through the banking sector, in first mitigating impacts of the downturn for the financial centre, and then fuelling another global city boom. The last of these is argued to be key to understanding not only why central London has done so well since the crisis, but how it is still liable to be 'the capital of boom and bust'. © The Author 2016.

For 1974-96, when the economy opened, state-run industries were privatised and labour rights weakened, we find a wage curve of -0.08. Based on this finding we conclude that the unemployment-pay elasticity in the post-reform period is similar to the -0.07 to -0.10 wage curve found in other western, capitalist countries. Disaggregating the analysis by group, we find that women, non-university educated workers and public sector workers have suffered more from unemployment.

Design/methodology/approach: The authors use the Sharpe ratio and Jensen’s α from multivariate regressions to perform a multi-country study to examine how CSR-oriented ETFs perform against global, national, and regional market indexes. The authors examine paired groupings of each CSR-oriented ETF with its corresponding index after appropriate risk adjustments. Findings: The authors find that CSR-oriented ETFs’ perform similar to their market indexes. Thus, individual investors can earn comparable returns while investing in CSR-oriented ETF, indicating that they can indeed do “good” while not missing out on returns. However, the authors also find that unlike the previously documented buffer effects that CSR-oriented firms enjoy, CSR-oriented ETFs do not outperform their market indexes during economic downturns. Thus, CSR-oriented ETFs are not safe havens for individual investors during times of economy-wide slumps. Research limitations/implications: The main limitation of this study is its limited sample size. Because the authors use novel hand-collected data, the authors have 11 CSR-focused ETFs with their corresponding indexes. Originality/value: To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study that examines individual investor participation using CSR-oriented ETFs. The study is made possible by hand-collected data on CSR-related ETFs which identify in detail the composition of each of these ETFs, and the findings highlight how individual investors can promote CSR while also making sound investments. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Corporate responsibility; Corporate social responsibility (CSR); ETF; Socially responsible investments (SRI)","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85028993639"

Reflecting upon the recent financial crisis and the subsequent worldwide economic downturn, an attempt is made to present a paradigm, inspired by Chinese practice over the past decades, from a historical perspective. We conjecture that a desirable China model may maintain the characteristics of a good economy as proposed in Phelps (2006) with full employment and rights to personal development. With regard to the functioning of freely competitive markets and macroeconomic policy, not only should a China model be able to mimic the rule of law and accountability of liberal western democracies, but it might also possess a mainstream ideology that is deeply rooted in Chinese culture with modern social sciences as theoretical foundations. To divest China of undesirable properties from the existing system, it is necessary to establish a principle-agent relationship that can provide stable governance structure for day-to-day efficient management of the economy and society, and protect the fundamental interests of its citizens when external challenges threaten to weaken social cohesion and political stability. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","China model; conventional wisdom; world economy","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84871353188"

However, this academic analysis was not mirrored in the profession as the buoyancy of the property market meant that rising prices hid any worry about the certainty of the valuation. But since 2007, the downturn has lead to a paucity of transactions and an accentuated degree of uncertainty. Valuers worldwide have been asking how to account for this uncertainty in their valuations. This paper aims to address this issue. Design/methodology/approach: This paper looks at the way in which uncertainty can be reported to the user of the valuation both in a form of words in accordance with the RICS's Valuation Standards as well as the suggested use of a probability-based valuation model (using Crystal Ball) that provides a graphical representation of the expected state of the market at the time of the valuation. Findings: The RICS Standards require the valuer to report uncertainty in valuations but they do not offer any advice on the form that such advice should take and, thus, there is no consistent approach. This paper suggests a matrix of outputs to allow users to identify quickly the uncertainty in the market at the date of the valuation. Originality/value: This study contributes significantly to the practical application of probability-based models to valuation. In particular, the findings from the study will be useful for clients to understand better the context in which a valuation figure is provided to them. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Accounting valuations; Economic cycles; Market value; Property","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-79955664619"

Assuming spatial mobility as increasingly dependent on the intrinsic characteristics of local contexts, the present study investigates long-term and short-term population movements in a European country (Greece), in light of regional urbanization processes and socioeconomic development. A multidimensional analysis of indicators of residential stability and background variables was carried out with the aim at evaluating the influence of local contexts on more general processes of population mobility. Different typologies of spatial mobility associated to factors (directly or indirectly) dependent on demographic dynamics, economic performances and urban cycles were identified. The empirical findings of this study evidence (more or less traditional) paths of internal migration and a latent process of population relocation across metropolitan regions, together with more recent international migrations at both working and retirement age. While short-range population movements were the ultimate result of late suburbanization in Greece, medium- and broad-range mobility consolidated the country's divide in urban and rural areas, evidencing the attractive role of Athens. Spatial direction and intensity of population movements reflect complex socioeconomic transformations, whose knowledge provides innovative visions for a better understanding of future demographic dynamics in Mediterranean Europe. © 2020","Demographic indicators; Economic downturns; Greece; Population movements; Urban-rural gradient","Greece; demographic trend; population migration; residential mobility; rural-urban comparison; socioeconomic conditions; spatial analysis","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089146495"

This article argues that individuals’ differences in political sophistication and, specifically, the commonly associated social-psychological characteristics are part of the micro-foundations for those different responses. People acquire and process information differently, which influences their political preferences. Public opinion and macroeconomic data from Europe during the economic crisis support the argument. The results show that people with lower levels of political sophistication tend to be procyclical, whereas this relationship weakens and moves towards countercyclical opinion structures with increasing levels of sophistication.

This database includes data on funding from bilateral and multilateral donors, non-governmental organisations, private foundations and the corporate sector. The database contains information on 1389 disbursements awarded by 30 entities between 2000 and 2012.; Results DACT declined only marginally from US$68.8 million (US$0.016 per adult) in 2009 to US$68.2 million (US$0.016 per adult) in 2011, but deviated significantly from its 2000 to 2009 trend. The sources of funding remain highly concentrated, with nearly a half of the money coming from the Bloomberg Initiative and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in 2011. The relative importance of institutional and research grants has declined.; Conclusions Our findings are consistent with the patterns in general levels of development assistance for health: after a decade of rapid growth, funding for tobacco control activities in LMICs has levelled off. Just as the tobacco control community is beginning to envision the endgame for tobacco, the funding remains erratic, inadequate, and highly vulnerable due to its level of concentration. Innovative financing mechanisms might help to increase the funding pool. © 2014 BMJ Publishing Group.

We will do this in two parts followed by a conclusion. In Section 1, we offer a succinct reconstruction of what has happened at the European Union (EU) level in euro-crisis law. After over half a decade of legal measures and prolific commentary on those measures, it is helpful to stand back and take stock. In Section 2, we present the particular perspective adopted by this book. Its core argument is that an overall and ongoing assessment of euro-crisis measures, especially by including the national level, is an important and distinctive contribution to euro-crisis legal scholarship. In the conclusion, we will consider whether euro-crisis law, although a fitting label to capture the conditions of its production and some parts of its application, has by now mainly become simply the macroeconomic law of the EU. Taking Stock: The Staging-Posts of Euro-Crisis Law In certain respects, the peaks of production of euro-crisis law by the EU and its Member States acting intergovernmentally are likely to be over. By euro-crisis law we mean the wide-ranging overhaul of macroeconomic law, institutions and governance triggered when the banking and financial crisis from 2007 onwards became interlinked with sovereign debt crises in euro area states. In this regard, it is somewhat poignant to note that the European Council Conclusions of December 2009 strike a note of optimism by welcoming the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty and noting that ‘the economic situation is now showing signs of stabilization and confidence is increasing’. Moreover, the European Council’s agreement on Europe 2020 in March 2010, while linked to the severe downturn caused by the banking crisis of 2007 onwards, was not yet connected to a developed euro-crisis agenda, although it asked for a Task Force to be set up, the recommendations of which proved highly influential in the first phase of euro-crisis law. We can accordingly trace the euro-crisis measures as they emerge from this date. Three key strands, with different staging posts, of euro-crisis law production can be identified. Two were seen by the EU institutions and the Member States as part of a linked package: first, sovereign debt loan assistance and the accompanying conditionality; and second, an overhaul of the macroeconomic governance regime in the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). © Cambridge University Press 2017.","","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85048693711"

A downturn at graduation increases the transition rate to first pregnancy among female graduates significantly. This effect is driven by females older than 24 years at graduation and is strongest in the first years after graduation and then decreases over time. We also find a downturn to decrease the probability of holding a degree-adequate job in the first years after graduation.

Whereas conventional wisdom suggests migration rates should increase during recessions as workers move out of areas that are hit hardest, initial evidence suggested that overall migration rates declined during the Great Recession, despite large regional differences in unemployment and growth rates. In this paper we use data from the American Community Survey to analyze internal migration trends before and during the economic downturn. First, we find only a modest decline in the odds of adults leaving distressed labor market areas during the Great Recession, which may result in part from challenges related to the housing price crash. Second, we estimate conditional logit models of destination choice for individuals who migrate across labor market areas; we find a substantial effect of economic factors such as labor demand, unemployment, and housing values. We also estimate latent class conditional logit models that test whether there is heterogeneity in preferences for destination characteristics among migrants. Over all, the latent class models suggest that roughly equal percentages of migrants were motivated by economic factors before and during the Great Recession. We conclude that fears of dramatic declines in labor migration seem to be unsubstantiated. © 2017 Russell Sage Foundation.","Great Recession; Latent class conditional logits; Migration","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85041100929"

There is simultaneous investment in a more 'employer-led' skills policy, in order to better tackle skills shortages and gaps. But is an employer-led skills policy the best way of boosting industrial growth in all UK regions? Are there potential market failures in employer-led policies of which the public sector should be aware?

Although the COVID-19 pandemic has been largely perceived as unprecedented by most economic sectors and businesses functioning within them, pandemics are not a novel phenomenon given their intermittent occurrence in the past. This study aimed at examining the resilience of four key sectors in Sri Lanka during the COVID-19 pandemic, namely apparel, tourism, agriculture and construction. The study sought to identify the factors that have both enhanced and hindered their resilience during the pandemic and provide recommendations to strengthen their resilience for future pandemics and multi-hazard scenarios featuring pandemics. The study draws upon primary data gathered through four round table discussions carried out with a total of 30 key informants representing the selected sectors. The findings reveal that for economic resilience to be achieved within the selected economic sectors, resilience building measures should be undertaken at three levels: 1) orgaizational level; 2) sectoral level and 3) country level, while also recognising the need for consonance and congruence between measures taken at each level. © 2022 The Authors","COVID-19; Economic sectors; Pandemics; Resilience; Sri Lanka; Systemic risks","Sri Lanka; business; COVID-19; economic growth; Gross Domestic Product; risk assessment; spatiotemporal analysis","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85134024629"

We conducted a longitudinal analysis of a sample of 868 bankrupt Spanish firms during the period 2004–2017. The empirical results show that stakeholder support and deep cost retrenchment increase the likelihood of survival and performance recovery, while aggressive layoffs are detrimental for turning bankrupt firms around. Surprisingly, intense asset retrenchment had no significant effects on firm survival and also pushed performance downward. The findings suggest that retrenchment should not be regarded as a general remedy for firms suffering the most severe of crisis. Bankrupt firms should focus on restoring stakeholder relationships and reducing superfluous expenses, while making employees redundant or selling assets should be evaluated carefully when attempting a turnaround.

Moreover, we find that the likelihood of conflict initiation is significantly higher during times of recession, but only in the absence of binding term limits. While binding electoral terms and economic downturns are both independently associated with increased levels of conflict initiation, in concert their conditional effects actually counteract each other. © The Author(s) 2013.","diversionary war; domestic politics; international conflict; term limits","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84901045162"

Since that time, the government has pumped $111 billion of new capital into these government-sponsored enterprises. Yet the future of these companies post-bailout is far from clear. As policymakers consider the future of Fannie and Freddie, it is useful to remember that this is not the first significant bailout of a governmentsponsored enterprise. The government also rescued the Farm Credit System in the 1980s. This Article examines the historical cycles in which Fannie, Freddie, and the Farm Credit System have funded loans: they fund more loans in good economic times but fund fewer loans in poor economic times. In other words, they fund loans pro-cyclically with business and credit cycles. By repeatedly providing bailouts, however, government officials demonstrate that they want these government-sponsored enterprises to fund loans in a countercyclical manner. This Article considers the advantages and disadvantages of three possible ways to induce countercyclical behavior. It concludes that policymakers should impose countercyclical capital requirements and create an insurance system funded with risk-based premiums to insure the companies' bonds. It further concludes that, even with these measures, occasional government bailouts may be necessary to stimulate lending during severe economic downturns.","","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-78650636755"

We find that many of the USA's leading high-technology centres have performed at or near the national average, but that some of the nation's most prominent technology centres have fared poorly during the downturn, including Silicon Valley. The main factors that accentuated economic decline in technology centres during the recent recession include: a poorly diversified overall economic base; limited diversity within high-technology industries; relatively high (all industry) wages; and high levels of venture capital funding during the end of the 'boom' period of the late 1990s. We find that counter to some of the recent literature on regional development and knowledge-based industry clustering and networking, the rules of regional economic development have not changed dramatically with the so-called 'new economy'. High-technology regions, just as 'traditional' industry regions over the past century, are vulnerable to pronounced economic cycles of growth and decline. The cycles can be particularly pronounced if regional economies are not well diversified and labour costs are not moderated during economic downturns. We also find that venture capital can exaggerate rather than moderate regional economic cycles, such as economic growth years in the USA from the late 1990s to the recession of 2001. The model suggests that free-flowing venture capital dollars may result in an over reliance on these funds, at the expense of a sound business model with sustainable growth and reasonable cash flow. Also, business networks associated with venture capital fund flow might be detrimental at critical economic turning points, often resulting in a rush of dollars in a limited business sector, rather than a diversified set of entrepreneurial ventures. © 2005 Taylor & Francis Group Ltd.","Economic diversification; Economic growth and decline; Regional industry clusters; Technology centres; USA economy","North America; United States; Western Hemisphere; World; economic diversification; high technology industry; industrial district; industrial performance","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-23844505253"

An increasing unemployment rate has led to a surge in the sense of job insecurity among employees. Lack of job security has a direct impact on an employee’s health and work–life balance. This article focusses on the relationship between and impact of job insecurity on work–life balance, that is, to understand the impact of perceived job insecurity on working hours, employee’s health and reduced family time. Using a self-completed questionnaire, data was collected from 413 employees from different sectors like construction, banks, hospitals, hotels, schools, FMCG, telecommunication, etc., in India, which assisted in testing five hypotheses. The study found a positive relationship between job insecurity and health issues and work–life conflict. Additionally, job insecurity was negatively linked with job performance. Regression analysis showed mediating effects of work demand, work time, family time and family demand on the relationship of job insecurity with health issues, job performance and work–life conflict. However, the article also discusses various effective mechanisms to reduce job insecurity and ways to curb its negative impacts on various organizational and personal outcomes. © 2022 Management Development Institute.","Employee’s Health; Job Insecurity; Layoff; Performance; Work–Life Balance; Work–Life Conflict","","Article","Article in press","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85124296942"

However, their actions are always embedded within a particular framework: Their employment trajectories are influenced by firm-specific opportunity structures, regional heterogeneities, and the business cycle. This article focuses on the structural factors framing worker’s mobility processes. Structural and cyclical determinants were assessed by combining a German linked employer-employee dataset with data on regional economic characteristics from the statistical “spatial planning regions”. The hierarchically clustered data were explored with multilevel analysis models. These identified the key factors influencing employment stability; the determinants of upward, lateral, and downward interfirm mobility; and transitions leading to unemployment. Our results show that employees can minimize the endogenous causality by taking advantage of particular framework conditions: A firm’s investments in further training and internal infrastructure impact positively on employment trajectories, and work councils increase employment stability, especially during periods of economic growth. In contrast, employment trajectories are destabilized by disadvantageous firm demographics and intensive use of fixed-term employment. During an economic downswing, employment opportunities are better in densely populated areas, whereas unemployment risks dominate in rural areas. In the period of economic growth, all employees within a region benefit from a higher local level of human capital regardless of qualification level, whereas during an economic downturn, skill segregation prevails and only the highly qualified benefit. © 2014, Institut für Arbeitsmarkt- und Berufsforschung.","Employment career; Job duration; Linked employer-employee data; Structural effects","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84975291046"

Economic contractions are associated with worsening morbidity and mortality, declining private health insurance coverage, and budgetary pressure on public health programs. This study examines the causes of healthcare employment growth and workforce composition in the US and evaluates the labor market's impact on healthcare spending and health outcomes. Data are collected for 50 states and the District of Columbia from 1999-2009. Labor market and healthcare workforce data are obtained from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Mortality and health status data are collected from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Vital Statistics program and Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. Healthcare spending data are derived from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Dynamic panel data regression models, with instrumental variables, are used to examine the effect of the labor market on healthcare spending, morbidity, and mortality. Regression analysis is also performed to model the effects of healthcare spending on the healthcare workforce composition. All statistical tests are based on a two-sided α significance of p <.05. Analyses are performed with STATA and SAS. The labor force participation rate shows a more robust effect on healthcare spending, morbidity, and mortality than the unemployment rate. Study results also show that declining labor force participation negatively impacts overall health status (p <.01), and mortality for males (p <.05) and females (p <.001), aged 16-64. Further, the Medicaid and Medicare spending share increases as labor force participation declines (p <.001); whereas, the private healthcare spending share decreases (p <.001). Public and private healthcare spending also has a differing effect on healthcare occupational employment per 100,000 people. Private healthcare spending positively impacts primary care physician employment (p <.001); whereas, Medicare spending drives up employment of physician assistants, registered nurses, and personal care attendants (p <.001). Medicaid and Medicare spending has a negative effect on surgeon employment (p <.05); the effect of private healthcare spending is positive but not statistically significant. Labor force participation, as opposed to unemployment, is a better proxy for measuring the effect of the economic environment on healthcare spending and health outcomes. Further, during economic contractions, Medicaid and Medicare's share of overall healthcare spending increases with meaningful effects on the configuration of state healthcare workforces and subsequently, provision of care for populations at-risk for worsening morbidity and mortality. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Health outcomes; Healthcare spending; Labor force participation; Labor market; Medicaid; Medicare; Unemployment","Adolescent; Adult; Cause of Death; Economic Recession; Female; Health Expenditures; Health Manpower; Health Status Disparities; Humans; Male; Medicaid; Medicare; Middle Aged; Outcome Assessment (Health Care); Regression Analysis; Risk Factors; Unemployment; United States; Young Adult; adolescent; adult; cause of death; economic recession; economics; female; health care cost; health care manpower; health disparity; human; male; medicaid; medicare; middle aged; outcome assessment; regression analysis; risk factor; statistics and numerical data; trends; unemployment; United States; young adult","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84899952386"

The regression results and the graphs have revealed that there is a strong relationship between the development of the services sector and the logistics performance of a country. Services are a major source of sustainable economic development, but they are very sensitive to the quality of the infrastructure and the functioning of institutions. Another finding is that many economies where a significant part of value added is generated in industrial activities tend to have high growth rates and lower logistics performance. Many of these countries are located in Central and Eastern Europe and their economic expansion was mainly supported by foreign direct investments in industrial sites and real estate developments. Since these businesses are cyclical there is a high risk of an economic downturn. These countries, particularly Romania, should rapidly improve their trade and transport facilitation framework, i.e., logistics performance. Such measures will allow the emergence of a robust service sector able to make the economic development sustainable by cushioning the cyclical shocks from the industrial side of economy.","Economic growth; Logistics performance; Services","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-69249115178"

In this paper, we investigate methods that Chinese and South Korean families have adopted to cope with the rapid changes brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. We emphasize families' responses to sudden changes in three domains: Education and home schooling, economic downturn and unemployment, and mental health challenges. By integrating online education and remote working into a new form of family life and sharing economic and emotional risks among members, families shape social order during a period of unprecedented uncertainty. We highlight the fact that family members experience intensified work-family or school-family conflicts. Disadvantaged families are the most severely affected, as they are at high risk of job loss and lack proper protections. The absence of institutional protections and interventions has created further economic and emotional hardships for these vulnerable families. Informal and nonregular workers require more stable labor market conditions for the wellbeing of their families. Future research may include a systematic data collection and analysis of disadvantaged families, as this would offer a better understanding of the challenges and untenable choices that families face during times of crisis. © Journal of Comparative Family Studies.","China; COVID-19; Disadvantaged families; Family resilience; Mental health; Remote learning; South Korea; Unemployment; Work-family conflict","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85096003839"

However, despite skyrocketing unemployment and widespread misgivings about immigration’s impact, no discernible wave of anti-immigrant sentiment has emerged in Spain; the ensuing puzzle accentuates in the southernmost region of Andalusia, where jobless rates surged beyond 35%. This study examines why anti-immigrant animosity remained stable at low levels, even receded, amidst such inauspicious conditions. Our explanatory model expects increasingly adverse pressures of perceived group-threat on natives’ sentiment toward immigrants to be compensated by increasingly benign impact of various benevolent predispositions and situational perceptions. To test these assumptions, we compute a repeated logistic regression model, discern coefficient from sample effects and examine time-trends among vulnerable populations; data were collected at the crisis’ onset (2008) and nadir (2013). Defying expectations, neither perceived group-threat nor principled pro-immigration credos (Universalism; pro-diversity) were found to affect the evolution of anti-immigrant sentiment appreciably throughout the economic downturn; however, ideological polarisation and elite-bashing yielded increasingly benign impact. These findings suggest that intergroup tensions were kept latent by a dynamics of political competition that has side-lined immigration as salient social issue: the prevalence of anti-austerity, anti-corruption political rhetoric contributed to pre-empting anti-immigrant sentiment. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Anti-immigrant sentiment; economic crisis; group-threat; political competition; Spain","Andalucia; Spain; competition (economics); financial crisis; immigrant; immigration; political economy","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85028777979"

This study used a constructivist, inductive approach to identify the challenges placed on families in one such community and the processes that strengthen family resilience. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 35 adult residents (30–76 years old, 19 women) from a community in Alberta, Canada, that has specialized in oil and gas extraction for 70 years and experienced its worst economic downturn while the study was underway. Results showed that many families have experienced an endless cycle of poor work–life balance and income instability throughout the economic cycle. Family life often lacked social cohesion as a consequence of demanding work schedules and economic pressures. Additional challenges were the perceived negative effects of rigid gender roles, substance abuse, family conflicts, and domestic violence. Crucial strengthening processes for family resilience were fundamental financial and living standard adaptations (e.g., living within or below one’s economic means; having both spouses become earners), maintaining regular contact by having a flexible home routine, and mutually agreeing to change roles during busts (former earners take responsibility for caregiving and running of the household and vice versa). Alternatively, accepting economic volatility and its impact on normal family life processes were essential for family resilience. Findings suggest the need for clinicians to help families foster resilience in communities that depend on resource extraction industries with concurrent adaptations required by individuals, families, and socio-political and economic systems. © 2021 Family Process Institute","ciclos económicos; industria de auge y caída; la maldición de los recursos; procesos familiares; resiliencia familiar","Adult; Aged; Family Health; Family Relations; Female; Humans; Middle Aged; Oil and Gas Industry; Resilience, Psychological; Socioeconomic Factors; adult; aged; Alberta; article; care behavior; clinical article; domestic violence; extraction; family conflict; family life; female; household; human; male; oil industry; resident; responsibility; running; semi structured interview; sex role; spouse; substance abuse; work schedule; work-life balance; family health; family relation; middle aged; oil industry; psychological resilience; socioeconomics","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85102170652"

These two models are widely seen as representing alternative paths to economic efficiency. However, the liberal market economies (LMEs) have traditionally been strongly associated with high levels of inequality, while the coordinated market economies (CMEs) have been more successful in combining economic growth with greater social solidarity (e.g., Acemoglu and Robinson 2012). A large body of scholarship suggests that the capacity of CMEs to support these more egalitarian outcomes is closely related to the way in which distributional compromises between labor and capital have been institutionalized. Two institutions featuring most prominently in understanding capitalist diversity are those for corporate governance and industrial relations. Corporate governance in CMEs is characterized by “patient capital” involving stable and committed shareholders who hold large ownership blocks of shares and insulate firms from hostile takeovers. These arrangements allow managers to take a long-term view that reflects a broad set of stakeholder interests. LMEs, by contrast, are associated with corporate governance institutions characterized by dispersed ownership, greater liquidity and arm's length modes of finance, and an active market for corporate control. Organized around an institutional logic of shareholder value and seeking to maximize short-term returns on investment, this pattern of corporate governance is thought to exhibit greater agility, for example, in mobilizing risk capital for new ventures and facilitating restructuring via mergers and acquisitions. Different corporate governance institutions are typically seen as supporting distinct industrial relations regimes (Höpner 2005: 16, figure 5; Aoki 2001; Aoki and Jackson 2008). Patient capital in CMEs underpins cooperative relations with unions by supporting investments in human capital and allowing firms to retain workers through economic downturns.

However, social support might buffer the effects of stress on mental health. In this study, we tested whether social support mitigated the effects of economic hardship on psychological distress on an at-risk sample from two of the European countries most affected by the 2008 economic downturn: Spain and Portugal. Participants were 249 caregivers enrolled in Child Welfare Services (73.0% women). Results showed that economic hardship and a negative indicator of social support (network dysfunctionality) were significant predictors of belonging to the psychological distress clinical group (OR: 2.35 and 1.80, respectively). However, no significant interaction effects were observed, thereby refuting the buffering effect hypothesis. When we conducted an in depth analysis of the clinical group, a significant moderation effect emerged. Our results suggest that, for at-risk populations, the detrimental effects of dysfunctional networks on mental health can outweigh the benefits of positive assistance and that social support is a potential stress buffer only for individuals in the clinical spectrum. These findings indicate that the protective effect of social support during circumstances of intense economic adversity is limited. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Economic hardship; Financial crisis; Mental health; Psychological distress; Social support","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85028760217"

The purpose of this paper is to understand the sub-micro reasons of centralisation during recession. Design/methodology/approach: To answer the research question, a qualitative methodology was applied based on interviews with senior managers of six English and seven Hungarian manufacturing companies. Findings: In the time of crisis, companies centralise because they would like to gain efficiency. The short-term advantages of concentration of authority (such as whole company focus, easier communication and higher decision speed) override its longer term downsides such as less innovation and flexibility. Practical implications: Cost cutting-driven centralisation can always generate faster results than a hazardous sales increase-driven decentralisation. A rapid centralisation can seem a safer and better choice than a stronger innovative capability of which results can be harvested only in the future. If companies centralise in the time of crisis and delegate during prosperity, adaptation to economic cycles can be crucial. This can gain competitive advantage if the companies can perceive economic situation and restructure their authority better than their competitors.

With their economy strongly reliant on the construction industry, these countries have become widely exposed to the downturn in the property sector. This paper aims to examine residential property bubble dynamics in the period from 2003 to 2014 and investigate the role of financing conditions in the formation of these bubbles. Design/methodology/approach: Building on the present value model in conjunction with the rational bubble assumption, the study applies the discounted cash flow (DCF) approach and applies weighted average cost of capital (WACC) to capture real estate bubble dynamics in the four countries. Reduced form vector autoregression models are used to examine the relationship between financing conditions and the bubble indicator. Findings: The bubble indicator suggests that Spain and Ireland experienced a large rise in the bubble relative to moderate increases in Portugal and Greece in the period from 2003 up to the collapse in 2008. Our findings from the empirical analysis indicate that central bank policy shifts that impact interest rates and lending volumes on the domestic level have a significant and leading effect on the formation of residential property bubbles. Originality/value: Only little research on real estate bubbles takes financial leverage into account. This paper bridges this gap by applying the WACC in the DCF model to identify real estate bubbles. While using a distinct bubble indicator, this analysis provides new insights into the linkage between financing conditions and real estate bubbles. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","DCF; Financing conditions; Property bubbles; VAR; WACC","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84982952486"

Although Jordan may appear little affected by the Arab uprisings, as early as January 2011 Jordanians were in the streets for the same reasons Tunisians and Egyptians were: protesting against economic conditions and privatization of state resources, demanding the resignation of the prime minister and his cabinet, and calling for political reform and an end to elite corruption. In 2010, Jordan Labor Watch reported over 140 labor actions of some kind, a significant increase over preceding years. The most obvious reasons for the protest wave related to the dire economic situation: the rising cost of fuel and utilities, depreciating wages and growing unemployment. Jordanians associated these difficult circumstances with the privatization of several key public assets, which coincided with the economic downturn.","","Jordan; Arab world; economic conditions; elite politics; labor relations; political reform; privatization; unemployment; wage","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84880011851"

Equally, any restriction or blockage to the flow of knowledge within an organization's supply chain, including its business partnerships and relationships with others, can cause a partial or total failure of the organizational environment in which it operates. Knowledge is the lifeblood of an organization and knowledge and information managers have a key role to play in keeping knowledge flowing, used and retained in their organizations. This role is particularly important during difficult economic times. The impact of budget cuts, office closures, voluntary and compulsory redundancies, falling demand and reductions in bank lending can each have unintended consequences, including acting as barriers - the restrictions or blockages - to the flow of knowledge.

The conservation sector is largely funded by government grants, private donations and sponsorship, and unsurprisingly faces increasing scrutiny in the current economic downturn. Furthermore, the observed failure to halt the decline of biodiversity provides additional pressure to organisations. In this context, business excellence models which have been utilised across many other sectors for evaluation, benchmarking and improvement planning could prove valuable in influencing the effectiveness of conservation management. This paper presents a sector-specific Conservation Excellence Model which describes how conservation managers can better understand how scientific processes and results can be aligned with financial and organisational measures of success. The relevance of the model is illustrated through evaluation of two well-documented species conservation programmes, and experience of adapting the assessment process to evaluate a fieldbased conservation programme is also presented. The potential benefits of using the Conservation Excellence Model include improved objective setting, more effective measures of biological success and clearer evaluation of conservation processes. The paper illustrates how assessment models can support improvement in organisations still unfamiliar with concepts of excellence. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","Benchmarking; Conservation effectiveness; Efqm; Evaluation; Improvement; Management; Planning","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84856408618"

A series of constraining measures taken previously have been loosened eventually. We investigate this situation using a political economy approach. Unlike in democratic countries, where interest groups play a crucial role in trade policy change, in China, given the political reality, leaders' will and trade partners' pressure are the determinant factors. We call this top-down and outside-in trade policy. Actually the idea of 'harmonious society' and 'scientific development' emphasised by top leaders in October 2006 paved the road for the following trade policy adjustment: i.e. reducing tax rebate, limiting processing trade, compressing the catalogue for foreign investment, etc. However, with the shock of a global financial tsunami, these measures get coastal areas relying on foreign trade heavily into trouble. The economic downturn in Pearl River Delta even astonished the decision-making body, calling on a quick reversal in foreign trade policy. If interest groups had been allowed to express their demand formally and adequately from the very start, the cycle of 'taking up first but giving up last' in policy design would have not taken place. In other words, the bottom-up and inside-out trade policy should be more stable. Although flexibility is necessary in the face of uncertainty, frequent and discretionary trade policy change usually produces effects of 'pro-government' not 'pro-market'. This is unfavourable for the transformation in China. The constraining trade policy in mid-2007 to mid-2008 has been a part of the government's desire to seek healthier development. However, with the inside and outside surroundings getting worse, the structural adjustment (long-run objective) has had to concede to the economic growth (short-run objective). © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","","China; bottom-up approach; global economy; international trade; political economy; trade policy","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-78649569007"

A vector auto regression (VAR) model analysis has led to the following four observations. First, an increase of base money raises aggregate output. Second, the impact of the QMEP is primarily transmitted through the channels of asset prices and bank balance sheets. Not verified are the transmission channels of the bank's information production, exchange rate, or the policy duration effect. These findings confirm the results of Honda, Kuroki, and Tachibana (2007). but the identification of bank balance sheets as a transmission channel represents a new finding. Additionally, these channels were reaffirmed even when subject to more rigorous analysis. Third, the QMEP raises interest rates in the long term, which raises doubt about the validity of the policy duration effect and, in particular, the signaling effect. Fourth, even during the period when a traditional interest rate policy was being implemented, base money had an effect on aggregate output. These results suggest that Japan's monetary policy has been an effective means of easing Japan's prolonged economic downturn. © 2009, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84977842784"

Against the backdrop of the recent COVID-19 pandemic, which had far more effects than a financial crisis, the existing paper reviewed the state of current research in the realm of corporate governance and risk-management practices. Design/methodology/approach: This study rigorously followed a systematic approach in identifying, selecting and critically synthesising the existing literature on corporate governance and risk management. The review was carried out on the Web of Science and Scopus database until December 31, 2022. In total, 72 research works were examined and reviewed. Findings: This systematic literature review showed that companies with strong governance mechanisms are less exposed to corporate risks. Several attributes, such as higher institutional ownership stakes, concentrated family ownership structures, lower CEO compensation and duality, higher presence of females in the management, better board dynamics in terms of independent boards and gender diversity are all strong mechanisms for mitigating risk. Additionally, socially responsible companies are better positioned to mitigate corporate risks. Furthermore, several themes emphasising the governance risk link have been identified to understand this domain further. Originality/value: By analysing and synthesising existing corporate governance and risk-management themes, this study ascertained various research gaps that can be addressed in future studies. Furthermore, drawing on this paper's essential cues, researchers can significantly differentiate their work from existing ones in the field. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Corporate governance; Corporate risk; Risk management; Systematic literature review","","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85153206849"

Insofar as modern expectations portend a future that should be improving, it is unsurprising that modern expectations or entitlements are throttled by economic and political downturns across many cultural and class conditions. Ensuing circumstances are not so much ‘post’ modern—since ideals of modern progress are not given up—as they are ‘reactively’ modern in cultural terms. In this context, a poignant and longstanding sense of backwardness in many areas of the insular Pacific arguably provides a cultural bellwether of increasingly widespread perceptions and reactions elsewhere. Among the Gebusi of Papua New Guinea prolonged economic downturn under conditions of marginality and remoteness has thrown people back on their own material and cultural resources. Despite a general absence of cash economy, monetisation or fiscalisation of ‘work’ increasingly orchestrates social relations. So, too, in the absence of government presence, police, or courts, mechanisms of dispute mediation have become locally developed and effectively elaborated, including through rhetorics of monetary compensation that were previously undeveloped in indigenous contexts of person-for-person exchange both in marriage and in death. In selected ways, reactive modernity among Gebusi has features that seem salutary—evoking an ‘anthropology of the good’—despite and even because of Gebusi's politicoeconomic marginality. Drawing on work by Ortner, Robbins, and others, the larger relevance of this development reframes the relevance of Dark Anthropology and an Anthropology of the Good. © 2018 Australian Anthropological Society","dispute settlement; marginality; modernity; Papua New Guinea; violence reduction; work and labour","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85058013437"

Specifically, two questions are addressed: a) is WTP stable over time? And b) if it is not, are the changes just driven by socio-economic effects, or something else? In order to investigate these questions, we used data from the Contingent Valuation Method (CVM) study conducted after the Prestige oil spill in Spain in 2006, and a second wave of the same survey repeated in 2009, after Spain entered a serious recession. Median WTP estimates dropped from €60.36 in 2006 to €26.92 in 2009 per household, a statistically significant reduction. To investigate the amount of the drop in WTP due to observables versus changes in preferences between 2006 and 2009, we use the 2006 logit WTP coefficient estimates with 2009 levels of the independent variables and we obtain a WTP of €46.37. This estimate is statistically different from the 2009 estimate (€26.92). In the same fashion, by using 2009 logit WTP coefficients with 2006 data, we obtain an estimate of €50.29, also different from the 2006 estimate. Implications of these findings for temporal stability of welfare measures and benefit transfer exercises are also discussed. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Economic conditions; Passive use value; WTP sensitivity","Spain; contingent valuation; environmental economics; oil spill; sensitivity analysis; spatial analysis; survey; temporal analysis; willingness to pay","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85019200148"

To elaborate on this question we make use of a bank-level panel data set which comprises of the monthly financial statements of public banks, domestically owned private and foreign-owned banks for the period between 2005 and 2019 operating in a large emerging market, Turkey. We exploited panel fixed effects methodology with a large set of macroeconomic and bank-level controls in various specifications. The results of our analyses demonstrate that public banks are less pro-cyclical in lending credits compared to private and foreign-owned banks by smoothing credit cycles during the upturns and downturns in the business cycle. This behavior strengthens during the recessions and financial distress periods as public banks lend significantly higher than domestic private and foreign-owned banks. Furthermore, the impact of bank ownership on credit allocation differentiates by the type of financial distress. If the source of the distress is global, foreign banks do not behave significantly differently from domestic private banks and during the local distress, foreign banks cut lending significantly more than domestic private and public banks. Overall, our findings suggest that while domestic private and foreign banks’ lending behavior is pro-cyclical with economic activity; public banks play a stabilizing role when financial conditions tighten or the economy overheats. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Bank ownership; Credit growth; Cyclicality of lending; Financial distress; Public banks","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85098634418"

Since 2008, the world-system may once again be entering another phase of structural deglobalization as the contradictions of capitalist neoliberalism, environmental degradation and uneven development have provoked different kinds of anti-globalization populism, rivalry among contending powers, trade wars and policies and social movements intended to mitigate the effects of anthropogenic climate change. This plateauing and possible downturn in economic connectedness is occurring in the context of U.S. hegemonic decline and the emergence of a more multipolar configuration of economic and political power among states. The combination of greater communications connectivity and greater awareness of North/South inequalities, as well as destabilizing conflicts and climate change, have provoked waves of refugee migrations and political reactions against immigrants. The result has been a period of chaos that is similar in some ways (but different in others) from what occurred during the last half of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century. This study investigates the question of whether the world-system is indeed once again entering another period of economic deglobalization and compares the current period with what happened in the 19th and 20th centuries to specify the similarities and the differences. We conclude that, based on changes in the level of economic connectedness since 2008, it is still too soon to tell for sure if the world-system is entering another period of deglobalization, but the important similarities between the recent period and earlier periods of deglobalization make it likely that the system is now in another deglobalization or plateau phase. © 2023 by the authors.","deglobalization; economic connectedness; economic history; foreign investment; globalization; international trade; protectionism; world-system","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85160235023"

The most acute concerns have been over the adoption of the common currency: by adopting the euro, countries renounce their ability to meet an asymmetric shock with independent revaluations of their currencies. We systematically test the prediction that regional specialization increases vulnerability to economic downturn using a novel dataset that covers all of the EU’s subnational regions and major sectors of the economy between 2000 and 2013. We find that, contrary to conventional wisdom, the most specialized regions actually fared better during the 2008-09 global financial crisis. Specialized regions performed worse only in states that remained outside the Eurozone. The heightened vulnerability of non-Eurozone states cannot be attributed to fiscal or social policy failures. Rather, our results suggest the common currency may have helped Eurozone members share risk.

The article focuses on the activities and initiatives of a new “species” within Metro Manila’s transport ecosystem–the transport reform advocacy group–to identify and examine both the constituent elements and complex operations of the ecosystem and its capacities for resistance, resilience, and reconstitution in the face of reforms. These reform initiatives include a proposed bus rapid transit (BRT) system, the loosening of number coding restrictions on public utility vehicles, the liberalization of point-to-point (P2P) bus services, the legalization of motorcycle taxis, the Public Utility Vehicle Modernization Program (PUVMP), the establishment of bicycle lanes, and the expansion and improvement of pedestrian walkways to improve micro-mobility in the metropolis. The article concludes with a consideration of the efforts of transport reform advocacy groups to advance these elements of their reform agenda amidst the ongoing global pandemic and the government-imposed quarantine and economic downturn in the Philippines in early-mid 2020. © 2020, © 2020 BCAS, Inc.","Duterte; Metro Manila; Philippines; reform; transport","National Capital Region; Philippines; bus transport; ecosystem approach; holistic approach; policy reform; public transport; traffic congestion; transportation policy","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85088384074"

Our model comprises the two credit-constrained sectors that raise external finance under credit market imperfection: financial intermediaries (FIs) and entrepreneurs. With the model estimated using the U.S. data, we find that a spread-adjusted Taylor rule mitigates (amplifies) the impact of adverse shocks when the shock is accompanied by a widening (shrinking) of the corresponding spread. We formalize a capital injection policy as a positive (negative) amount of injection to either of the two sectors in response to an adverse shock (a favorable shock). In contrast to a spread-adjusted Taylor rule, a positive injection boosts the economy regardless of the type of shock. The capital injection to the FIs has a greater impact on the economy compared with that to the entrepreneurs. Our result shows support for adopting the spread-adjusted Taylor rules and capital injections, although welfare implication varies depending on the source of economic downturn and excessive responses aggravate welfare.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84878432379"

Design/methodology/approach: This paper closely compares critical economic and regulatory aspects of the current farm downturn with two previous farm crises in the 1920s and 1980s, and equally importantly, the golden eras that occurred before them. This study compares key aggregate statistics in land value, agricultural credit, lending regulations, and also evaluates the situations and impacts on individual farmer households by using three representative case studies. Findings: The authors argue that there are at least three economic and regulatory reasons why the current farm downturn is unlikely to slide into a sudden collapse of the agricultural markets: strong, real income; growth in the 2000s, historically low interest rates; and more prudent agricultural lending practices. The current farm downturn is more likely a liquidity and working capital problem, as opposed to a solvency and balance sheet problem for the overall agricultural sector. The authors argue that the trajectory of the current farm downturn will likely be a gradual, drawn-out one like that of the 1920s farm crisis, as opposed to a sudden collapse as in the 1980s farm crisis. Originality/value: The review provides empirical evidence for cautious optimism of the future trajectory of the current downturn, and argues that the current downturn is much more similar to the 1920s pattern than the 1980s crisis. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Agricultural credit; Farm crisis; Farm downturn; Farm income; Interest rate; Land value","","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85042852100"

But in a world of economic downturns, un- or underemployment as well as political unrest access to an increasingly global market becomes the personal and organisational solution to a host of unwanted happenings. In these circumstances, it therefore becomes less clear whether the heightened mobility of transnational workers is a benefit or indeed a choice. This article examines the onus placed on employees to be geographically mobile for their jobs. Relocation enables organisations to operate in expanding transnational markets and fields; it is therefore a prerequisite of jobs in an increasing number of sectors. Through systematic comparison of the attitudes to mobility of highly skilled employees in a ‘market’ (corporate) and a ‘moral’ (UN) case-study organisation, this article makes a contribution to our understanding of work orientations in transnational institutions. It interrogates the myth of choice of highly skilled movers and identifies the aspirations, contradictions and dilemmas that are associated with relocating for their jobs. Analysis of biographical interviews in tandem with online survey data elucidates the complex ways that the competing repertoires of choice and compliance are woven into transnational narratives. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","choice; mobility; organisations; Transnational professionals","compliance; international migration; labor mobility; migrant worker; multinational enterprise; relocation; skilled labor","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84999723794"

However, in Nigeria, since the mid-1980s there has been a steady rise in the number of women breadwinners in many households. In spite of this, not enough studies have been conducted on this emerging phenomenon. Using feminist and political economy theories as explanatory tools, the study examined women breadwinners in Nigeria using Ile-Ife of Southwestern Nigeria as a case study. Both quantitative and qualitative methods of data collection were utilized to explore the circumstances leading to the rise of women breadwinners in the study area. The study showed that the increase in the number of women breadwinners was as a result of Nigeria's economic downturn, husbands' uncaring attitude and the need of women to properly bring up their children in line with societal norms. Breadwinning role was found to have impacted negatively on the women, a situation traceable to their socio-economic profiles such as low educational status, occupation and income which have made sustenance of the family very difficult. The paper concludes that the phenomenon of women breadwinners and the problems they encounter are due to economic recession and patriarchy in Nigeria. Governmental interventions that would primarily contribute to wellbeing of women breadwinners were suggested as a long term measure to ameliorate their peculiar problems. © 2016 Journal of International Women's Studies.","Feminism; Gender; Nigeria; Political economy; Women breadwinners","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84980039372"

An extensive search of relevant research papers to the scope of the review led to the identification of 31 articles published by February 2022. Our analysis traces the evolution of studies on green bonds’ interactions with other markets, the methodologies and data frequencies used for cross-market relations analysis, and the role of green bonds in portfolio risk management (diversifier, hedge, and safe-haven) in normal and extreme market conditions. The study reports several interesting findings. First, green bonds can be a strategic safe-haven avenue for investors in stocks, dirty energy stocks, and the foreign exchange market in the US and China in extreme market downturns. Second, green bonds demonstrated hedging properties against spillovers from Bitcoin, forex, soft commodities, and CO2 emission allowance. Third, the role of green bonds in the markets of natural gas, industrial metals, and crude oil is limited to a portfolio diversifier in different investment horizons. Fourth, green bonds had no diversification or hedge benefits for investors in conventional bonds. Fifth, the interrelationships between green bonds and most markets’ understudy were influenced by macroeconomic and global factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic, economic policy uncertainty, OVX, and VIX. Our review of the literature also facilitated identification of future research topics. The outcome of the review offers insightful information to investors in green bonds in risk management and assets allocation. Policy makers can benefit from this review in effective policy legislation for the advancement of the green bonds market and acceleration of a smooth transition to a net zero emission economy. © 2023 by the authors.","diversification; green bonds; hedge; risk management; safe haven","China; United States; economic diversification; economic policy; hedgerow; investment; legislation; risk assessment; stock market","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85156170485"

Lacking other options, many turn to transit vehicles, stops, and stations for shelter. Many also ride public transit to reach various destinations. With affordable housing scarce and the numbers of unhoused individuals often surpassing the capacities of existing safety nets and support systems, transit operators face homelessness as a pressing issue on their systems and must implement policy measures from other realms beyond transportation to address it. Because of the health and safety implications for transit of the COVID-19 pandemic and the anticipated further rise in homelessness from the resulting economic downturn, studying and responding to the needs of these vulnerable travelers is critical. We conduct a comprehensive literature review to identify articles discussing homelessness in transit systems. While only a handful of articles exist from the 1990s, there is an emerging literature in the last 20 years that examines different aspects of homelessness in transit systems. We identify and review 63 articles on homelessness in transit systems and other public settings to better understand the extent of homelessness in the U.S., and how transit agencies perceive its impacts. We also summarise literature findings on the travel patterns of unsheltered individuals, which show that public transit represents an important and common mode of travel for them. Lastly, we focus on responses to homelessness from the part of transit operators. We find two types of responses: 1) punitive, in which criminalisation, policing and enforcement of laws and codes of conduct prevail, and 2) outreach-related, which aim towards providing help and support to unsheltered individuals. We conclude by summarising our findings as well as the existing gaps in the literature. © 2021 The Author(s).

Since electricity demand varies as does the supply by RES, the remaining residual load must be covered by flexible technologies that are required to balance the different types of fluctuations. In this study, these flexibility options are divided into three categories: increasing the residual load, decreasing the residual load and shifting the electricity demand / supply temporally or spatially. Furthermore, typical technological options are discussed for each category, and four flexibility criteria are used to compare their technical and economic characteristics. These include the activation time, duration of flexibility provision, number of activations and activation costs. The study reveals that various options exist and no one technology dominates. However, within the flexibility categories, it can be shown that some appliances have advantages in three of the four categories compared to the other options. Ultimately, the choice of the most appropriate flexibility option depends on the requirements of the energy system. It can be concluded that a mix of technologies will be needed to cover the future flexible demand that may include short-term changes of the residual load as well as long-term downturns of RES generation. © 2017 IEEE.","Energy markets; Energy system analysis; Flexibility options; Modelling; Sector coupling","Chemical activation; Electric power utilization; Energy policy; Models; Power markets; Renewable energy resources; Economic characteristics; Electricity demands; Electricity supply; Energy markets; Energy system analysis; Flexibility options; Flexible technologies; Renewable energy source; Commerce","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85027190383"

School closures have threatened children’s ability to learn and later return to school well prepared. The impact of the economic recession is going to be even more devastating: first for students, but also for the ability of some Catholic schools to maintain their enrollment and remain sustainable financially in countries where they do not benefit from government support. This paper, the first in a set of two, looks at some of the likely impacts of the COVID-19 crisis on Catholic Schools in developed countries with a particular focus on the United States, a country not only hard hit by the crisis but also where Catholic schools are especially vulnerable to downturns. While Catholic schools may be able to respond to the immediate chal-lenge of school closures among others through distance learning options, their ability to maintain enrollment during the economic downturn is less clear. How schools will respond to the twin challenges of ensuring learning during school closures and beyond, and remaining affordable for families at a time of economic stress, may affect whether they are able to maintain their comparative advantage. A key aim of the paper is to make Catholic school teachers and leaders aware of some of the discussions on how to respond to the crisis, and provide links to online resources that may be useful. © 2020, Loyola Marymount University.

More specifically, this ‘thesis of the constitutionalization of downturn- austerity in Europe’ has two dimensions: a (narrow) normative and a (broader) causal one. The former holds that downturn-austerity is a legal obligation under EU law; the latter assumes that the European constitutional framework effects downturn-austerity without neces- sarily claiming a legal obligation. I will argue that the former is incorrect, and yet shapes the hegemonic understanding of EU law. I will maintain that the normative constitutionalization thesis should be understood as an ideological communication, which aims to cloak the significant distributive effects of the crisis measures with an unwar- ranted aura of legal necessity, political coherence, and academic legitimacy. © 2017 The Author.

While industry turnover leads to an appreciation in firm value, managerial entrenchment reduces shareholders' wealth. The negative impact of managerial entrenchment on firm value, however, outweighs the positive impact of industry turnover.

Early studies suggested that labour demand ‘collapsed’. This initial forecast proved to be overly alarmist, due to the short-run view. We find that labour demand has rebounded sharply, though an aberration has appeared in recent months. Using what is believed to be a near-universe of online jobs postings, we demonstrate that while total job postings are up 43% from pre-pandemic levels, only one-tenth of that increase is driven by increases in new postings. This suggests that the growth in job postings in the labour market is being driven by jobs that are remaining unfilled. Labour force participation has dropped to levels not seen since the 1970s, while unemployment claims have mirrored other recent economic downturns. Combined, these two measures account for almost all the remaining jobs shed during the recent economic downturn. Analysing the characteristics of these job postings, we find a decrease in required skills and salary compared to the pre-pandemic periods. Individuals appear unwilling to re-enter the labour market, likely because of the quality of jobs currently available, leading to an overall labour shortage. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Covid-19; job vacancies; labour demand; recessions; unemployment","COVID-19; labor market; skilled labor; unemployment","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85116459883"

Local government debt in China is in a dynamic process of financial innovation. The competition of local officials for promotion and the characteristics of China’s fiscal system are the reasons behind the growth in local government debt. The yardstick for the promotion competition is the local GDP growth rate and this drives local officials to increase expenditure to achieve their targets. Because in China’s fiscal system the central government often gives priority to reducing its fiscal deficit and the central government can largely determine the distribution of revenue and expenditure between itself and local governments, there is a tendency for the fiscal burden to be shifted from the central government to the local governments. Resolving China’s local government debt problem requires not only strengthening regulation, but also abandoning the central government’s fiscal balance target, because this target may make regulation hard to sustain in times of economic downturn. This paper discusses central-local fiscal relations in the framework of Modern Money Theory, suggesting that China’s central government should bear more fiscal burden because a central government with currency sovereignty can always afford any spending denominated in its own currency. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","China; fiscal system; local government debt; modern money theory","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85081235861"

Parties have frequently been seen as essential mechanisms for communication between state and society- perhaps especially in times of crisis, such as the severe economic downturn that struck the Nordic countries, and many others, in 2008-9. The country chapters in this volume (chapters 3-7) have examined each of the Nordic policy processes in detail. The purpose of this chapter is twofold: To outline the basic ways in which parties have contributed to Nordic democracy and to assess their roles in contemporary Nordic politics. Put another way, it offers an assessment of the ""crisis-of-party"" thesis, or at least one of its variants, ""the redundancy of party"" thesis (Daalder 1992). This suggests, inter alia, that parties have atrophied organizationally and been marginalized in the promulgation of public policy. As so often in political science, the chapter's conclusions are mixed. Nordic parties are in many ways weaker than they were, but they remain fundamental to political life in our five countries. In what follows, I concentrate on the first link in the chain of delegation and accountability that underpins this volume's analytical framework-that is, the link that connects electorates and parliamentarians. With an eye to Key's (1964) distinction, mentioned in chapter 1, between the party in the electorate, the party organization, and the party in government, this chapter addresses the first two aspects.1 In other words, although this chapter will consider interparty relations in parliament, it will not examine the party in government-in the sense of how parties manage the work of their affiliates within the cabinet, within ministries, and among the top-level civil service. The analysis is divided into two parts, inspired by Müller's (2000) suggestion that parties play a double role in delegation within parliamentary democracy. On one hand, they enhance voters' scope to select politicians to act on their behalf, thanks to the parties' capacity to screen would-be candidates, and then synchronize the preferences and interests of public-office holders, thus allowing voters to judge the performance of a coherent body of representatives. This can be seen as the constitutional track of delegation. At the same time, delegation also occurs within the parties. Through some mechanism, a party needs to decide, first, which aspiring politicians it will endorse through formally associating them with the party label; and, second, who among the party's ranks will lead its policy-making work. These collective choices are likely to produce considerable overlap in the agents selected. Public-office holders, then, can often be said to have two principals: The electorate that voted them in and the partisans who presented them to the electorate in the first place. Of course, this conception of double-track delegation is a central part of the ideal-typical Westminster model. In the model, political competition is channeled through a simple electoral system that favors just two main parties, both of which are long-established, with ""brand names"" (as distinct policy-preference packages) that are well known to electors. The parties have plenty of connections to the electorate through mass-membership organizations. These organizations offer a wellspring of potential election candidates for the parties to recruit from. After an election, under the Westminster model, government is controlled by a single winning party, which thus dominates policy output. This enables the electorate to hold its agents directly responsible for what they do; no other parties or institutions blur this clear line of accountability. Parties are strong, while parliament, as an institution in its own right, is weak. If we assume that one party wins a majority of seats, and that its MPs act in a disciplined way, then the leadership of this parliamentary party decides the legislative agenda. Parliament as an institution becomes little more than a rubber stamp, in which the main constraint on the governing party leadership is the need to keep its own backbenchers happy (King 1976). How well does this model capture politics in the Nordic countries? In fact, not particularly well. The parties are-or have been-strong in various ways. At the same time, parliaments have also been strong, which is a deviation from the Westminster model. Because a single party rarely wins its own majority, the party leadership that heads the government must negotiate constantly about legislation with other party leaderships in order to secure parliamentary majorities. Interparty bargaining is thus the dominant mode of operation. Sometimes negotiation occurs within the more or less stable framework of majority coalition government, in which two or more parties share control of the cabinet and collectively command a parliamentary majority. As chapter 2 showed, however, governing parties in some Nordic countries often control only a minority of the parliamentary seats, which makes parliament the main arena in which interparty negotiation takes place (Damgaard 2000, 278-80). If these negotiations fail, the cabinet cannot legislate as it wants. Even if they succeed, the cabinet will probably have to compromise on its basic preferences. The need for constant interparty bargaining is seen as making parliament ""strong."" Strong parties and strong parliaments are an unusual combination, but it became the norm in Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden. The chapter develops as follows. In the next section, I begin with a brief overview of the origins of the party systems and individual parties' historical association with specific segments of society. This provides a platform for the following two sections, which follow Müller's distinction between tracks of delegation. In the first of those, I examine patterns of cooperation and competition between parties-that is, the party systems-and their potential for abetting democratic delegation. There is then a review, based on data aggregated from the earlier country chapters, of the extent to which those electorates have felt willing to avail themselves of this potential. This is followed by a look at developments within the party systems to assess the clarity with which rival government constellations have been presented to the Nordic electorates over time. In the subsequent section, I look at the party track of delegation. In effect, this means party organization, particularly the extent to which the Nordic parties traditionally resembled the classic models of organization used in the academic literature, and the implications that this might have had for democratic delegation. © 2011 by the University of Michigan Press.

In this paper, we present new evidence drawing from the fine-grained stratigraphic record of Housepit 54 to assess details regarding change in subsistence and technology as related to population and social dynamics. Results indicate a long and complex history characterized by two complete demographic cycles. Critically, the two subsistence downturns were managed using different tactics. Reduced local resources during the first period was likely managed with shorter stays in winter residences, somewhat more extensive use of the landscape, and continuation of egalitarian social relations. The second economic downturn followed a short-lived boom in resources and population growth that created extremely competitive social conditions. The subsequent downturn was managed by entrenched winter sedentism and likely social control of access to critical resources. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Bridge River site; Complex fisher-hunter-gatherers; Indigenous history; Lithic technology; Malthusian demographic models; Zooarchaeology","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85084990284"

While previous studies use models relying on area-specific unemployment rates to estimate this average effect, this paper employs a model based on area-specific unemployment rates by gender and age group. The rationale for breaking down unemployment rates is that the severity of cyclical upturns and downturns does not only significantly vary across geographical areas, but also across gender and age. The empirical analysis uses microdata from the Italian Multipurpose Household Survey on Everyday Life Issues. The estimates suggest that models employing aggregated and disaggregated unemployment rate measures as a proxy for the business cycle produce similar findings for some health behaviours (such as smoking), whereas different results are obtained for others. While using unemployment rates by gender and age group, fruits and/or vegetables consumption turns out to be procyclical (a 1pp increase in this unemployment rate decreases the probability of consuming at least five daily fruit and/or vegetable servings by 0.0016pp), the opposite effect, though statistically insignificant, is observed once general unemployment rates are used. While both models conclude that physical activity declines during economic downturns, the size of the procyclical effect is much smaller when employing disaggregated rather than aggregated unemployment rates (a 1pp increase in the unemployment rate by gender and age group decreases the probability of doing any physical activity by 0.0017pp). © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Business cycle; Health behaviours; Italy; Unemployment","Adolescent; Adult; Age Factors; Alcohol Drinking; Economics; Exercise; Female; Fruit; Health Behavior; Humans; Italy; Male; Middle Aged; Sex Factors; Smoking; Vegetables; Young Adult; adult; female; fruit; gender; health behavior; household; human; Italy; male; physical activity; probability; smoking; unemployment; vegetable; adolescent; age; drinking behavior; economics; epidemiology; exercise; Italy; middle aged; sex factor; statistics and numerical data; young adult","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85034453182"

As passenger car emissions were found to be significant and rapidly increasing, their reduction was specially targeted. Following a bill passed by US Congress in 1968, requirements were set in 1970 for the vehicle manufacturers to reduce the emissions of carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbons (HC) with 90% by 1975, and nitrogen oxides (NO. x) with 90% by 1976. These requirements were soon adapted to the Japanese regulatory framework, and were known in both countries as the ""Muskie Act"" or ""Muskie Law"" after the senator who developed the original bill. The new requirements spurred tremendous research and development efforts. Car manufacturers and research institutions in USA, Japan and Europe investigated and developed alternative solutions, including gas turbine and steam engine vehicles. California, the USA state with the most severe air quality problems and the only state at the time allowed to establish more strict requirements than federal regulation, established requirements implying the use of oxidation catalysts in 1975 and three-way catalysts (TWC's) in 1977. Japan as a nation adopted similar requirements 1976 and 1978. Export of cars from Japan to USA increased rapidly. The rest of USA adopted emission standards similar to California's only in 1981, timing USA vehicle sales rebound after the energy crisis and grave economic downturn. Strict requirements were thus established only after more than a decade of civic and legal processes between federal authorities, the car manufacturers and NGO's. The history of vehicle development is one of cooperation and competition. This paper argues that the international cooperation on different levels of society (government, industry and science) together with commercial competition between the two countries was strong, continuous and instrumental in enabling the development of technology, appropriate regulation and infrastructural changes and thus created a market for cleaner cars and effectively reduced emissions from the growing vehicle fleet. In other words, the introduction of TWCs was reinforced by the simultaneous development of mitigating technology in two car producing countries competing for market space. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Automotive; Emission control; Environment; Innovation; International; Regulation","California; Japan; United States; Air quality; Automobile engines; Carbon monoxide; Catalysts; Commerce; Commercial vehicles; Competition; Emission control; Energy policy; Fleet operations; International cooperation; Nitrogen oxides; Technology transfer; Automotive; Automotive emission control; Cooperation and competitions; Environment; Environmental pollutions; International; Regulation; Research and development; air quality; automobile; carbon monoxide; emission control; environmental protection; innovation; nongovernmental organization; pollution control; technological development; Automobile manufacture","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-79952757410"

To verify this, this paper assesses the influence of Shanghai (securities) stock exchange composite (SSEC) index on S&P GSCI total returns, a leading commodity composite index from August 31, 2006, to September 19, 2016. We implement wavelet transform to extract the approximations of SSEC and GSCI. Furthermore, we use the state space model to determine the margin between SSEC and GSCI as well as display the margin dynamic evolution over time. The margin denotes the units of GSCI change when SSEC increases a unit, which can display China's stock (equity) influence (CEI) on the international commodity market. We found that CEI reached its peak in 2007, then experienced two steep declines and an immediate mild rebound, and eventually hovered at a historically low level. Moreover, each inflection point of CEI could correspond to a specific international economic event, which indicates that the change of CEI is influenced by exogenous variables, especially the absolute increment of GDP and the U.S. dollar index. The influence of China's stock market on the international commodity market is not as great as believed and the diversification benefit still exists for the construction of portfolio. In addition, the change of China's stock market influence is closely related to exogenous factors, which deserves more attention for policy making to avoid unnecessary trade and monetary friction owing to misjudgment. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","China stock market; International commodity market; Multi-scale impact; Time-varying influence","China; Commerce; State space methods; Wavelet transforms; China stock markets; China's Stock Markets; Exogenous variables; Inflection points; International economics; Multi-scale; State - space models; Time varying; commodity market; economic relations; Gross Domestic Product; international trade; policy making; stock market; Financial markets","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85049349401"

However, European countries have engaged with this alleged power drift differently, with only a few member states demanding more parliamentary scrutiny of EU institutions. This article develops a political economy explanation for why only some states have enforced mechanisms to monitor the EU more closely. Our theory focuses on the role of the crisis and the impact of fiscal autonomy in countries outside and inside currency arrangements such as the European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). We argue that, in the aftermath of a severe economic shock, member states outside the EMU possess more monetary and fiscal resources to handle the crisis. These would then demand oversight of EU decision-making if their fiscal sustainability depends on the Union. By contrast, Eurozone states that need policy changes cannot address the crisis independently or initiate reforms to scrutinize the EU. Hence, we argue that during the heated moments of severe economic downturns, parliaments in Eurozone countries discuss supranational supervision rarely. As these legislatures have nevertheless to give in to the popular demand for EU control, they express support for more EU supervision in the infrequent times of debate. We provide evidence for our theory with a cross-national analysis of EU oversight institutions, and a new original dataset of parliamentary debates during the Eurozone crisis. Our findings highlight the political consequences that financial nosedives have across the diverse membership of a supranational organization. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","EU politics; Euro crisis; Financial crises; National parliaments; Parliamentary scrutiny","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85085381178"

Not only did its actions become more predictable in 1991-2002, it responded asymmetrically only to output, switching to act more acutely in downturns. Although its asymmetric behaviour could result from asymmetric preferences or non-linear aggregate supply, our results support the former explanation. © 2006 The Economic Society of Australia.","E52; E58","Australasia; Australia; banking; inflation; interest rate; monetary policy","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-33746714398"

Manufacturing enterprises are the main performers of R&D investments, so it is imperative for policymakers to accurately evaluate the policy effect of different industrial tendency and policy intensity on growth. The impact of the overall R&D expenditure on macroeconomy or the effectiveness of enterprises’ R&D investment on business profit has been reported in a great deal of literature, but so far, the impacts of enterprises’ R&D have little been experimented at the macro level and industrial level. This paper improves the knowledge production function and structured a regional dynamic computable general equilibrium model to simulate the multi-dimensional macroeconomic impact of enterprises’ R&D investment. The results show that enterprises’ R&D investment has a significant role in promoting economic output, residents’ welfare, price control, and international trade, and its impact is declining over time. The impacts of enterprises’ R&D on different industries are heterogeneous; industries with lower knowledge capital are more sensitive to R&D investment. These findings contribute to the effectiveness of R&D policies. © 2023 The Society for Policy Modeling","China; Economic growth; Policy simulation; R&D policy","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85173167781"

Since the early 1970s, the broad thrust and predominance of neoliberal politics swept across much of the Western world and beyond (Harvey 2007; Powell 2007). Such ideas had greatest impact in the United Kingdom and the United States, where they were articulated in, and embedded by, the New Right Conservative policies of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and in the so-called ""Reaganomics"" of President Ronald Reagan, respectively. While the rise of neoliberalism as ""a global narrative of development"" (Powell 2007, 1) provides the social and political backdrop to this chapter, the Anglo-Foucauldian writings that draw on Foucault's account of ""governmentality"" (Dean 1999, 2007; Miller and Rose 2008; Rose 1999) are used to help us make sense of some of the changes occurring in the ways in which we are governed in the early twenty-first century. Specifically, in this chapter, we concentrate on what has been termed ""advanced liberalism""1 (Dean 1999, 209; see also Rose 1993), and especially on some of the ramifications of this mode of governing for sport policy in the United Kingdom. New Labour's election victory in 1997 ended eighteen years of Conservative rule in the United Kingdom. It also announced the emergence of Third Way2 politics and the construction of a new social welfare policy architecture. In line with these developments, a number of writers (e.g., Dobrowolsky 2002; Dobrowolsky and Jenson 2005; Dobrowolsky and Lister 2008; Featherstone 2006; Jenson 2005; Jenson and Saint-Martin 2003, 2006; Lister 2003, 2004) provide insights into and critiques of Anthony Giddens's (1998) articulation of a ""social investment state"" and the valorization of the ""active citizen."" Recently, Giddens has argued that this amounts to ""State-provided or regulated investments in human or social capital"" (2007, xiii). Although Giddens played a prominent role in communicating to New Labour the salience of Third Way politics and social investment strategies, the antecedents of the party's embrace of social investment thinking can be traced back to the truncated leadership of the late John Smith and the report by the Commission on Social Justice (CSJ) in 1992. The CSJ (1994) report ""advanced now familiar policy positions that shaped the identity of New Labour"" (Dobrowolsky and Jenson 2005, 207). Spending on programs for employment rather than welfare, lifelong learning, the complementarity of economic and social policy, and a child focus for social investment have all been identified with New Labour policy positions.

This paper identifies the effects of the measures on poverty, household income and household consumption expenditure under the disproportionate effect of the pandemic. Design/methodology/approach: This study analysed the Korea Household Income and Expenditure Survey (KHIES) with Changes-in-Changes at five percentiles (5, 25, 50, 75 and 95%) instead of Difference-in-Differences (DD) because the parallel trends assumption of DD cannot be investigated due to the recent KHIES redesign. In addition, it also exmined the effects on vulnerable groups (e.g. female, elderly and young households). Findings: COVID-19 has had prompt and disproportionate effects on the vulnerable, such as low-income, female and elderly households. However, the government measures had a limited effect. First, the measures could not mitigate the initial income reduction and only had temporary positive effects on income and consumption expenditure. Second, young households tended to save the relief instead of present consumption. Lastly, education disparity was observed at 25 and 50%. Therefore, this study suggests that response measures need to be sustainable and concentrated on the vulnerable. Originality/value: A large literature estimated effects on either household income or household consumption expenditure, and focused on macroeconomic indices (e.g. marginal propensity to consumption). This study analysed both income (poverty) and consumption expenditure and found policy implications for better welfare system in an economic downturn. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","COVID-19; Poverty; South Korea; The emergency disaster relief funds","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85124747382"

They migrated for economic reasons but also hoping to distance themselves from gendered duties and obligations that confined them to oppressive feminine roles. Less than a decade later they bought into Spain’s housing bubble in an effort to ‘make up’ for their departure. I argue that Ecuadorian migrant women’s decisions to buy mortgaged homes in Barcelona were in part informed by their conceptualizations of domesticity, care giving, and motherhood. For women portrayed as culpables or ‘culprits’ for leaving Ecuador and failing to upkeep their caregiving responsibilities in their country of origin, the promise of homeownership became a way of accomplishing complex forms of transnational caregiving as well as upward mobility. This article focuses on gendered conceptualizations of care, motherhood, and kinship amongst Ecuadorian migrant women and the relationship these notions have with housing financialization. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","care giving; Ecuadorian migrant women; gendered financialization; mortgage debt; Spain financial crisis","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85123227635"

While this is a very welcome development for several reasons, the bulk of the organizations work still focuses on raising agricultural productivity, as exemplified by the allocation of its regular programme budget. FAO faces important challenges in tackling some of the most important issues that a food systems approach would require, such as trade. A historical review of FAOs work on nutrition serves to illustrate that focusing on nutrition and food systems is nothing new for FAO, dating to the earliest discussions that eventually led to its establishment. However, at that time the different interests of its member countries prevented it from tackling important related issues such as agricultural trade. A global food crisis (2008) and the reform of FAOs Committee on World Food Security (CFS) did not even succeed in opening a space for a serious discussion on trade issues which divide its member countries. With an increase in hunger and malnutrition (FAO (2019) Given the state of food security and nutrition in the world, need to safeguard against economic slowdowns and downturns. FAO, Rome) and new leadership at FAO, this is an opportune time to review the major challenges faced by the organization and to search for a more comprehensive conceptual framework and efficient approach in tackling complexities involved with food system. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Access; Agricultural policies; CGIAR; Food system; Governance; History; Holistic; Labor; Productivity; Strategic; Trade","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089328947"

The results indicate low levels of overall technical and managerial efficiencies in Ontario sawmills, which have been further impacted by economic downturns. Further analysis reveals that the size of the sawmills has had a statistically significant impact on their relative technical efficiencies. The main source of inefficiency was the management of operations, particularly when these sawmills were not able to adjust their inputs with changing and uncertain market demand conditions.

We have used an exploratory action research approach focusing on eight variously purposed large-group methods (AmericaSpeaks, Appreciative Inquiry, Conference Model®, Decision Accelerator, Future Search, Participative Design, Strategic Change Accelerator/ACT (IBM), and Whole-Scale™ Change). We interviewed nine leading practitioners and creators for each method, as well as six clients who had played key roles in most of these methods' execution at their organizations, asking them to reflect on the current practices and outcomes and the future of each respective large-group method, as well as the methods as a group of interventions. Based on our findings derived through theme and content analysis of interviews, we purport that both the Art (excellence in method execution) and the Artist (the right facilitator) are necessary for achieving desired outcomes of the large-group methods. We stipulate that critical elements of the Art include these five common elements (or five ""I""s): having the right Individuals in the room; aiming the method at resolving the right Issue; having Intentional process (including pre-work, intra-method process, and follow-up); having the right Information in the meeting; and using the right Infrastructure (such as appropriate physical space, technology, etc.). We suggest that while these elements of Art are important, the simultaneous requisite role of the Artist is to manage the tension between the rigidity of the Art (the 5 ""I""s) and the emerging human dynamics occurring between the large-group method process and the associated evolving client objectives. That is, to achieve desired outcomes, the execution of large-group method needs to be both highly premeditated and ingenious. We supplement our findings with client case descriptions and quotes from the practitioners and conclude that these large-group methods are particularly appropriate for resolving a variety of issues facing today's organizations operating under the conditions of high technology saturation, interdependence, globalization, economic downturn, and others - and that this, with some exceptions, will likely remain the case in the future. However, the future use of these methods will be challenged by the availability of Artists who can execute the methods so they lead to desired outcomes. We close with discussion of open questions and directions for future research.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-79951546000"

After months, if not years, of speculation, the company had finally decided to move all its European manufacturing from Limerick to Lodz in Poland. Among the many reasons cited - from the global economic downturn to a shifting market - cost-competitiveness became the clear determining factor. The media coverage was extensive, with the headline 'Dell Closes' bandied about in the national and regional press. Though of little consolation to the 1900 left without a job, the fact remains that Dell has not closed its Limerick operation, where it will continue to employ upwards of 1000 in sales support and research and development. We use the Dell story as an exemplar of the Irish foreign direct investment (FDI) story. Comparing it with other restructurings by foreign-owned technology companies both in Ireland and beyond we will attempt to uncover the complexity of shifting competitiveness and competencies among branches of global operations. Although the case of Dell, among others, may serve to support the political economy view of large multinational corporations, we see the picture as being more complex and rely on literature relating to global production networks (GPNs) in attempting to uncover the shifting spatial dynamics of cost-competitiveness. © The Author(s) 2011.","affiliate evolution; Dell; Europe; Ireland; territorial competitiveness","County Limerick; Ireland; Limerick [County Limerick]; Lodz [Poland]; Munster [Ireland]; Poland; competitiveness; economic conditions; foreign direct investment; global economy; manufacturing; multinational enterprise; political economy; territoriality","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-80053983375"

The present study examines the effect of state level immigration legislation on immigrant Latino families at a time of high immigration, when immigrants are settling into locations which have not historically had immigrant populations, and during an extended economic recession (Mather, Children in immigrant families chart new path: Reports on America, 2009; US Bureau of Economic Analysis, Economic downturn widespread among states in 2009: Advanced 2009 and revised 1963-2008 GDP-By-state statistics, 2010; US Department of Homeland Security, Secretary Napolitano announces deferred action process for young people who are low enforcement priorities, 2012). Immigrant families today are likely to differ from those of the past in that they are more likely to be from Latin America or the Caribbean and include unprecedented numbers of unauthorized immigrants (Passel and Cohn, Unauthorized immigrant population: National and state trends, 2010, 2011; US Department of Homeland Security, Secretary Napolitano announces deferred action process for young people who are low enforcement priorities, 2012). The present study draws on interviews with 40 families from an emerging immigrant destination in North Central Indiana to help illuminate the ways in which local legislation and enforcement impacts immigrant Latino families. Results illustrate how state level immigration legislation can create barriers and challenges for immigrant Latino families, with authorized and unauthorized status alike. This study also finds that many immigrant Latino families are mixed status families, where a family consists of both authorized and unauthorized immigrant status family members, and thus share the plight of unauthorized family members.

Higher educated women were more likely to become inactive, but returned to work also more easily, especially when they added work experience. Being married, whether mother or not, induced a rearrangement of time between staying at home and labour, in rendering exit from employment more likely and return from inactivity to employment less likely. Exits from employment were less frequent for mothers of larger families, while return to employment decreased with the total number of children, in spite of the growing financial needs of larger families. Transitions between employment and inactivity increased with favourable economic conditions.

The goal of this article is to explore the differences in privately held family and nonfamily firms in various types of stability, including stability in the number of employees, revenue, earnings and assets. Using multiple linear regression analysis in a sample of 384 family and 1 795 nonfamily firms from the Czech Republic, we found that family firms tend to be more stable in terms of revenue and number of employees, but only during times of crisis. However, their greater employment stability results in worse labour productivity and their earnings become more volatile. During the post-crisis period, there are no significant differences in stability between family and nonfamily firms. Moreover, family firms have been found to grow less during both the economic downturn and the recovery. We suggest that the feature of stability that is so often attributed to family firms by popular, but also academic papers, should be used with caution. © 2019, Nomos Verlagsgesellschaft mbH und Co.

If so, does voter response vary according to the composition of fiscal adjustments? The empirical literature on the political economy of fiscal adjustments, which is mostly OECD-based, argues that consolidations do not have significant electoral consequences. In contrast, we find that voters punish fiscal consolidations at the polls in Latin America. To explain this result, we focus on the way fiscal adjustments episodes are implemented, both in terms of their design (taxes vs. spending) and timing. Such episodes rely fundamentally on increasing tax rates and bases of indirect taxes (such as the VAT) that hit broad segments of the population. Moreover, these policies are often implemented when politicians have no choice but to consolidate, that is, under severe economic circumstances. These macro results are corroborated with micro evidence from an original survey experiment that measures voter's fiscal policy preferences over the business cycle in seven countries across Latin America. The experimental evidence shows that respondents prefer expenditure cuts to tax increases during downturns, which is the opposite of the type of consolidations that countries typically pursue. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Business cycle; Elections; Fiscal deficit; Public expenditures; Taxes","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85087979372"

Against the background of shadowy figures of turbaned and veiled migrants as the racialized trope of Irish 'racism without racism', the article argues that through the strategy of convening migrant-led associations and networks, migrants, though forced to appropriate state parlance, enact their own 'integration from below', making integration work in new exciting ways. © The Author(s) 2012.","Integration; Interculturalism; Ireland; Migrant networks","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84859057091"

The recent 2008 global economic crisis has been proven to have accelerated urban shrinkage in many previously prosperous cities. The city of Dongguan, which is known as the World's Factory, suffered a manufacturing downturn and labor outflow induced by the crisis; however, it exhibited high resilience as it displayed a quick recovery in the postcrisis period. The notion of regional resilience and its potential applications can explain why urban and regional economies resist and adjust to internal and external challenges in a long-term development process. Based on the adaptive cycle analytical framework, this study focused on specific policies and plans initiated by the Dongguan municipality when it faced the financial crisis and its implementation effects. It contributes to current knowledge by elaborating on how the local state reacted to and coped with crisis-induced shrinkage and by providing a valuable case for exploring the dynamic evolution of shrinkage and resurgence in the context of globalization. Three main resilient strategies are identified: (1) moving toward a more diversified industrial structure; (2) highlighting endogenous momentums in economic transition; and (3) advancing the equalization of social welfare for local residences. Moreover, it provides implications for the urban planning community on how to respond to uncertainty and vulnerability from the perspective of regional resilience.  © 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Adaptive cycle; Financial crisis; Globalization; Regional resilience; Shrinking cities; Urban shrinkage","China; Dongguan; Guangdong; Economics; Urban planning; Dynamic evolution; Economic transitions; Financial crisis; Global economic crisis; Implementation effects; Industrial structures; Long-term development; Planning community; financial crisis; global economy; globalization; regional economy; shrinkage; urban area; urban planning; Shrinkage","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85105228455"

Based on the estimated rules, fiscal shocks are identified. According to the results, fiscal policy, in particular public consumption, investment, and transfers prevented a sharper and prolonged decline of German output at the beginning of the Great Recession, suggesting a timely response of fiscal policy. The overall effects, however, are small when compared to other domestic and international shocks that contributed to the economic downturn.

After all, the breakthrough in Sino-American rapprochement occurred in the wake of some of the worst violations of basic human rights in China when literally millions of people were persecuted and an untold number killed during the so-called Cultural Revolution. These atrocities did not deter Washington from seeking detente with Beijing and a united front to contain Moscow. Nor did the fact that the United States (US) was fighting a war against China's communist ally stop Beijing from pursuing this rapprochement. Since 1972, the US had disengaged from Vietnam and the economic conditions and social freedoms, if not political rights, of the Chinese people had improved immensely as a result of the reforms launched under Deng Xiaoping. Yet tension between the two countries has mounted rather than abated. How could this be? Some people may point to the changes in the international balance of forces. The disintegration of the Soviet Union enabled uncontested US hegemony, making China's partnership dispensable and changing Beijing's status (along with Baghdad and Belgrade) to a candidate for Washington's ""substitute enemies."" Others may refer to more profound and enduring differences in the Chinese and American political economy and political culture-in what they are or think or see themselves to be. These differences are not haphazard or ephemeral. Rather they are the defining characteristics of these systems. They form integral elements of their self-image and professed ideology, and constitute the core institutions of their respective societies. They are persistent and deeply entrenched. While submerged during periods of cordiality, they re-emerge as points of contention during downturns in Sino-American relations. When expressed as the uncompromising ideals of Maoist egalitarianism or American individualism, the divergent views and values motivate competitive attempts to seize the moral high-ground in campaigns more designed to score rhetorical points than to affect actual behavior.","","China; United States; cultural influence; hegemony; human rights; international relations","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0036852411"

Design/methodology/approach - The paper uses the market model to estimate betas over the past 15 years for SRI funds and conventional investment funds during economic downturns, as distinct from during more ""normal"" (non-recessionary) economic times. Findings - The beta risk of SRI, both in Australia and internationally, increases more than that of conventional investment during economic downturns. Traditional fund managers and trustees in Australia are therefore likely to breach their fiduciary duties if they go long - or remain long - in SRI funds during economic downturns, unless relevant legislation is reformed. Research limitations/implications - The methodology assumes that alpha and beta in the market model are constant. Second, it categorises the state of the market into ""normal"" economic conditions and downturns using dummy variables. More sophisticated techniques could be used in future research. Practical implications - The current law would prevent conventional funds from investing in SRI. If SRI is viewed as socially desirable, useful legislative reforms could include explicitly overriding the common law to allow conventional funds to invest in SRI; introducing a 150 percent tax deduction or investment allowance for SRI; and allowing SRI sub-funds to obtain deductible gift recipient status from the Australian Tax Office and other taxation authorities.

The paper focuses on corporate giving, a CSR dimension that is especially important in an economic downturn such as the one experienced by many European economies since 2007-2008. Design/methodology/approach: A theoretical framework comprising product differentiation and market competition is proposed. The paper investigates whether adverse economic conditions refrain corporate giving or, alternatively, stimulate it as a differentiation and demand enhancing instrument. Econometric empirical testing on the business cycle properties of giving at an aggregate level is also conducted. Findings: According to theoretical results, firms seem to refrain giving under adverse economic conditions in the short run. Empirically, the paper concludes for a pro cyclical contemporaneous relation of corporate giving with real gross domestic product, supporting the theoretical finding. In a dynamic perspective, however, giving causes revenues and firms tend to donate more than a few years after the downturn. Originality/value: The paper examines the behaviour of an under researched component of corporate social responsibility, which is especially important in economic downturns - giving. It considers continuous degrees of market competition and differentiation. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Business cycle; Corporate giving; Corporate social responsibility; Demand sensitivity; Oligopoly markets","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84989869483"

We consider both R&D expenditures and patents as innovation proxies and evaluate consequences of the economic downturns of 2000 and 2008. We find that R&D investment increases with ownership by institutional blockholders and with the number of institutional owners, confirming the key role institutions play in innovation activities of firms. We observe higher R&D levels for firms with more independent boards, more females board members and more outside directorships held by directors. We report that firms with CEO/chair of the board duality have lower R&D intensity, as do firms with higher ownership by directors and with a higher mean board age. Innovation is negatively related to CEO salary levels, but positively related to the ratio of incentives to total compensation, confirming that incentives contribute to aligning shareholders and management interests, which leads to better long-term decisions. However, those incentives reduce the number of patents. We do not find any systematic changes in R&D for the 2000 recession, however there is an increase for the 2008 financial crisis.  © 2021 World Scientific Publishing Europe Ltd.","Canada; corporate finance and governance; Corporate governance; innovation; R&D investment; United States","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85091770959"

This association is particularly strong for larger banks, banks that maintain lower capital ratios and banks that are managed by more powerful Chief Executive Officers (CEOs).

The goal of this paper is to identify the combinations of fundamental entrepreneurial determinants that drive opportunity recognition (OR) in different economic environments. We focus on two points in Tunisia’s recent economic cycle: before and after the 2011 Revolution. Using micro-level survey data, the study employs ordered logit analysis to identify basic entrepreneur characteristics that may increase the likelihood of identifying entrepreneurial opportunities during these two economic cycle phases. Several key factors, such as training, creativity, and social networks, are found to be ineffective in the OR process. Furthermore, education attainment lost its major and well-established function throughout Tunisia’s profound and protracted socioeconomic crisis. Only self-efficacy and prior experience have particularly strong effects on identifying entrepreneurial opportunities during the period of economic downturn. Despite the government's efforts to incorporate entrepreneurship education into university curricula and business practices, these findings show that Tunisia is still in the early phases of entrepreneurship integration and development, with patchy and uncoordinated activity. The drivers of entrepreneurial perception in the quest for opportunities described by western theories should not be applied uniformly in less developed economies, which have unique political and economic contexts and challenges. We also noticed that the revolution’s resulting crisis did not deter young entrepreneurs from launching business ventures. This finding may pique the Tunisian government’s interest in devising an effective strategy to support young entrepreneurship, especially in light of the new COVID-19 outbreak’s potential impact on Tunisia’s already vulnerable economy. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Crisis; Entrepreneurship; Opportunity recognition","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85125084538"

The structural origins of the ongoing state fiscal crisis are well known. Excessively procyclical revenue structures, combined with spending obligations that increase with economic downturns, have resulted in a budget dynamic for the states that is not sustainable over the long term. The consensus solution to this problem is for states to save money during boom times (via budget stabilization or ""rainy day"" funds) and to draw on those savings during recessions. Unfortunately, numerous studies have shown that states do not save anywhere close to an adequate amount for this to be an effective strategy. As a result, during each of the past several downturns, states have turned to the federal government for fiscal assistance-often derisively termed ""bailouts""-to address fiscal imbalances. Yet these bailouts have their own problems, including creating an incentive for states not to establish adequate rainy day funds, which in turn increases the likelihood of future bailout demands. To escape from this vicious cycle, we propose a set of federal policy reforms to facilitate state savings. We offer a menu of policy options, rather than a single solution, because we argue that existing evidence does not clearly explain why states do not save. Therefore, we first analyze the possible sources of failure and then tailor a number of remedies for each; in nearly all cases, it is clear that states would be unable to overcome the problem on their own, making federal intervention particularly apt.

Many are realizing that the costs of traditional collection management through journal subscriptions and particularly the ""Big Deal"" are not only burdensome but unsustainable. The result of these forces will likely be continuing diversification in access models, with institutions acquiring content through subscriptions, aggregators, patron-driven acquisition (PDA), document delivery, and repositories. Increased complexity in business models and the high cost of information will bring increasing need for careful evaluation and analysis of financial efficiencies. The obvious place for such analysis to occur is in the library. PDA offers inherent cost savings for libraries, as the library only pays for the content that is read. In this article, we will describe a trial of a PDA service for scholarly journal articles, using ReadCube Access technology, and executed in partnership between the University of Utah and Nature Publishing Group (NPG).

Among telecommunications service providers and equipment manufacturers, swings from prosperity to downturns have been reflected in their respective stock performances. However, the more recent and fairly abrupt slowdown, particularly in capital spending on networking equipment, has resulted in massive corporate restructuring and workforce realignment in the telecommunications industry.

As Morris (2005) explains, local and national disability organizations have had some signiﬁcant successes in promoting independent living, with research conducted using the social model of disability and involving disabled people and their organizations playing a key role in inﬂuencing policy development. However, there remains a limited understanding across the political spectrum of what independent living means and what is necessary to achieve it. Discussion in this chapter, therefore, seeks to show how independent living has been represented on the policy agenda. It begins by outlining the development of independent living in the US and its inﬁltration to encourage a network of independent living services, structures and policy initiatives in the UK. Alongside these changes, the chapter moves on to highlight broader policy through community care, direct payments and other cash payment schemes both in the UK and across North America and Europe. Whilst shifts to cash payment models have undoubtedly improved the choices for and the lives of many disabled people, commentary shows that their position in a service-led and resources-poor system of social care has restricted independent living options for much of the disabled population. The chapter concludes by looking at the prospects for independent living in an era of economic downturn. © 2012 selection and editorial material, Nick Watson, Alan Roulstone and Carol Thomas.","","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84864762954"

Italy represents an interesting case study because it has one of the highest PARP rates in Europe, together with a weak labour market, an inadequate social security system, and a pronounced territorial dualism. EU statistics on income and living conditions (EU-SILC) longitudinal data are used. Logistic regression is applied to disentangle the relationship between household and main earner characteristics and the likelihood of being persistently poor. According to our results, male employees are more likely to hamper persistent poverty for their households; the opposite holds true for women as family breadwinner. Human capital endowment also shows a relevant role in preventing persistent poverty. The presence of children, instead, makes households more vulnerable. The South disadvantage slightly decreases at the beginning of the crisis. This is due to the worsening economic conditions in the North and Centre, affected to a wider extent by the economic downturn. The Italian welfare system appears ineffective in protecting worse-off households, and policies aimed at protecting employment, supporting women labour force participation, the elderly, and households with children would be needed. © 2016 The Author(s).

The paper begins with information on the rates of unemployment and long-term unemployment since 1980 to the present day. The authors point out that several demographic changes mean that this economic downturn will be different for families than in previous years. Women are now engaged in the labour force at much higher rates than previously and, as a consequence, there are more dualincome families. Single-parent families may be particularly vulnerable in difficult economic times, given their reliance on a single income. Surprisingly, there is little direct evidence of the effect of unemployment in economic downturns on families, but there is fairly good international evidence on the impact of unemployment on families more generally. Gray et al. summarise evidence on the scarring effect of unemployment, and the impact of unemployment on mental and physical health, crime, family functioning and children. Also discussed is the impact of economic downturns on broader contextual factors, such as the geographic concentration of unemployment and disadvantage, housing, and social exclusion. There have been some substantial falls in asset values, particularly in the stock market, and this has flowed through to superannuation balances and the authors suggest that this may have an impact on families, as older workers may delay their retirement.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-79957528976"

The main purpose of this paper is to determine the dynamics between Australian sovereign bond yields and geopolitical risk. This is achieved by employing a quantile regression analysis. The findings of this study indicate that the impact of geopolitical risk on Australian sovereign yield dynamics is asymmetrical. Furthermore, an increase in geopolitical risk only impacts short-term yields at extreme regimes. However, the impact is, by and large, insignificant. On the other hand, an increase in geopolitical risk does have a statistically significant positive impact on medium- and long-term yields across most quantiles. Lastly, an increase in geopolitical risk tends to result in a steeper yield curve at the belly of the curve but causes the yield curve to flatten at the long end. This study is the first study that holistically examines the dynamics between geopolitical risk and Australian sovereign bond yields. The study thereby contributes to the body of knowledge on Australian bond yields, specifically, and adds to the sparse body of knowledge on the dynamics between geopolitical risk and sovereign bond yields. The findings of this study have implications for monetary policy makers, given that shifts in sovereign bond yields could impact all three core mandates of the Australian Reserve Bank. Furthermore, changes in the slope of the yieldcurve could be used by monetary policy makers to pre-empt changes in future economic growth.

We find that economic growth is the most robust variable for economic voting, before and after the Great Recession.

However, divergences in STEM education agendas at regional and national levels imply disparities in policy formulation and implementation in the Global North and Global South. This study sought to explore what informs the drivers of STEM education in the two geo-economic blocks with a view to understanding contextual factors that inform practice. A focus on STEM education in the Global North and Global South becomes necessary, given the widespread calls for collaborative work, for example, shared interests in addressing sustainable development goals, and research on the COVID-19 pandemic. A theoretical approach, based on a review of relevant literature, was adopted. Ideology critique informed the analysis and was used to make sense of the salient themes. In the Global North, STEM education is historically driven by ambitions of political dominance, the need to curb economic slumps and address critical skills shortages, and growing desire for extra-terrestrial colonization. Within this context we argue that a neoliberal agenda drives the STEM education enterprise. In the Global South, massification with equity dominates policy formulation and implementation as countries battle to redress past colonial imbalances. The Global South countries generally sign up to regional and global STEM education agendas but financial constraints compounded by an unabated brain drain result in stagnation at policy adoption at vocational level. Convenient partnerships are increasingly fashionable as countries in the Global North seek to exploit the geographical advantage of those in the Global South in order to fully utilise the extra-terrestrial space, resources for biomedical science and indigenous natural resources, among others. Collaboration endeavors between the Global North and Global South need to be mutually beneficial. The Global North needs to redistribute the aspects of power it holds in relation to STEM to move towards more equitable policies and practices across these geopolitical realms. We recommend greater vocationalisation of STEM education hinged on STEM integration with the humanities in the Global South and balanced, mutually beneficial STEM collaboration endeavors with the Global North countries.

In this interview, Frederick Reichheld argues that loyalty drives financial success  especially, in today's volatile economy. As companies face the harsh realities of an economic downturn, holding onto their customers must be a priority for growth. Reichheld believes companies must focus on building a loyal customer base by forming strong relationships with front line employees. By keeping profitable customers and growing relationships with them, the “loyalty leader” companies identified by Reichheld out-performed their competitors in the stock market by a factor of 2.2 on average during the 1990s. Bain research shows that a mere 5 percent increase in customer retention generates 30 percent to 40 percent increases in a customer's lifetime profitability in industries like software and building management, and as much as 90 percent gains in financial services and advertising. Reichheld concludes that companies can only build a sustainable competitive edge by creating enduring, mutually beneficial relationships built on trust with employees, customers and suppliers. The ability to build and nurture loyalty over time has become an invaluable differentiator for successful organizations. © 2002, MCB UP Limited","Customer requirements; Human resource management; Leadership; Loyalty","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84993029693"

This book looks at the process of a merger or acquisition and pinpoints the areas where business intelligence can raise the odds of success in each phase of the deal. Using techniques developed by governmental intelligence services and a wide range of recent case studies, quotations and anecdotes, the expert authors from the renowned Cass Business School show how to build success into any M&A situation. The first edition of Intelligent M&A was written in 2006 and published in 2007. This preceded the peak year (2007) of the last merger wave, including the excesses in a number of industries and deals (e.g., financial services with RBS’ dramatically failed acquisition of ABN AMRO as a key example), and the global economic downturn that led to a completely new way of operating for many industries and companies.

In developing the curriculum, faculty took into consideration competencies required by the Association of American Medical Colleges and qualitative results from surveys of medical school applicants and enrolled students. Strategies for curriculum delivery included lectures, panel discussions, role-playing, and training in the use of a spirituality assessment tool. A majority of the 250 students who received the training in 2010-2011 were able to demonstrate the following competencies: (1) being sensitive to patients' spiritual and cultural needs, (2) assessing patients' and their own spiritual needs, (3) appropriately using chaplain services for patient care, and (4) understanding the effects of health disparities and ethical issues on patient care. Challenges to implementation included a reduction in chaplain availability due to the economic downturn, a lack of student exposure to direct patient care during shadowing, too little religious diversity among chaplains, and changes in assignment schedules. New competencies required by the National Board of Osteopathic Medical Examiners overlap with and help ensure sustainability of the Spirituality in Medicine curriculum. KCUMB leaders have incorporated the use of the spirituality assessment tool into other parts of the curriculum and into service experiences, and they have introduced a new elective in palliative care.

Our identification procedure allows us to perform counterfactual experiments which suggest that credit spread shocks have largely contributed to the deterioration in economic conditions during the Great Recession.

Unfortunately, some of the information necessary to make informed decisions about capital regulation has been missing. Existing regulations establish numerical capital requirements. Regulators, however, have significant discretion to set higher capital requirements for individual banks. In considering necessary reforms, regulators often focus on specific numerical requirements but sometimes ignore enforcement efforts. Without clear information about capital enforcement, it is impossible to make informed judgments about the current capital regulation system. This Article provides a more complete picture of capital enforcement. It reports an empirical study of all publicly available formal capital enforcement actions between 1993 and 2010. The data, compiled from 2350 enforcement actions, reveal four significant insights. First, the number of capital enforcement actions has dramatically increased during the current economic downturn. Second, an increasing number of banks are subject to individual capital requirements-requirements that are higher than the requirements specified in statutes and regulations. Third, the data suggest that enforcement rates are not consistent among bank regulators. In particular, the Federal Reserve is less likely than other regulators to bring serious capital enforcement actions and is less likely to increase capital requirements. Fourth, the data show a near-complete absence of capital enforcement actions issued to the largest banks. The Article examines the proper role of this discretionary enforcement. It concludes that a capital regulation system that relies heavily on individual bank capital requirements is troublesome. This type of discretionary capital enforcement can be ineffective and costly. Moreover, the focus on individual bank conditions can blind regulators to macroeconomic problems. Instead, policymakers should work to create capital rules that are sufficient without significant discretionary capital increases.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84863419923"

In particular, we fit a three-regime switching model that allows market parameters to behave differently during economic downturns, with the regimes representative of the tranquil, volatile, and turbulent states. We document that the tranquil regime is the most frequent for the whole period, while the dominant regime is the volatile one for the crisis of 2008 and the turbulent one for the first four months of 2020. We fit the same model to the returns of the Dow Jones Industrial Average index and find that during the same period of investigation, the most frequent regime has been the tranquil one, while the volatile and turbulent regimes share the same frequencies. Additionally, we use a multinomial logit model to describe the probabilities of volatile or turbulent regimes. We show that, in the case of the S&P 500 index, the returns from the Volatility Index (VIX) index are significant for both the volatile and the turbulent regimes, while the gold, WTI oil, and the dollar indices have some explanatory power only for the turbulent regime. © 2020 by the authors.

I argue that Southern European countries in fact hold their own specific ways of incorporating migrants which may be equally or even more positive than those of older immigration countries. At the same time, I maintain that they appear rather heterogeneous in this regard, questioning the idea of a single Southern European model. I will test these hypotheses by comparing Italy, Spain, Portugal, and Greece with some Western European older immigration countries and by observing the trends of migrant incorporation during the Great Recession which started in 2008. The economic crisis is here regarded as both a factor of change and a 'stress test' of the actual robustness of migrant incorporation in the target countries.

It focuses on income smoothing as a type of earnings management. Design/methodology/approach: The study analyzed banks in 21 African countries from 2002 to 2014. The estimation techniques used are the fixed effect regression technique, descriptive statistic and Pearson correlation statistic. The model used in the study expresses LLPs as a function of its discretionary and non-discretionary determinants. Findings: African banks audited by Big 4 auditors use LLPs to smooth income and the incentive to smooth income is greater during an economic downturn or recession. Also, African banks audited by a Big 4 auditor use income smoothing to lower high earnings during the financial crisis and in the pre-financial crisis period but not in the post-financial crisis period. Originality/value: The literature shows that the presence of Big 4 auditors improves earnings quality. The direct impact of Big 4 auditors on earnings management in African banks has received little attention in the literature, and the impact of audit quality on bank earnings smoothing particularly in Africa is yet to be known. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Auditing; Banking; Earnings management; Income smoothing","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85108998905"

Through active promotion and pushed by economic development in neighboring countries, visitor numbers almost doubled from 4,771,555 in 2001 to 8,350,835 in 2008; since then, worldwide economic downturn, disaster, and a soaring yen have taken their toll. However, while their contribution to the overall Japanese tourism market is still well below 10%, an analysis of available data shows that foreign tourists are spread unevenly across the country. As a result, some restricted inbound clusters have evolved. In these places, inbound tourism as a new sector of the tourism market can play an important role in rejuvenation of destinations and innovation in tourism. One such destination is Hida Takayama, a historical town tucked away in the mountains of Gifu Prefecture, which is considered a model for the development of inbound tourism in Japan. An analysis of Takayama’s tourism development process identified close cooperation between the public and private sector, the integration of inbound promotion into a wider set of tourism policies, and the combination of independent efforts by the city with active use of national policies as important factors for its formation as an international destination. As a result, the city attracts tourists from a variety of regions. A survey conducted with Japanese and different groups of foreign tourists proved that they differ in motivations and behavior and, therefore, add a stabilizing element to the tourism market. Finally, interviews with key persons from tourism associations and the accommodation industry, and a survey of small-scale businesses to examine innovations induced by the increase in foreign tourists showed that an active embracement of the new market segment is restricted to a small number of facilities. Through these steps of analysis, it could be shown that the impact of international tourism on destinations in Japan is limited to a number of places, where it nevertheless constitutes an important element of market stabilization and rejuvenation. However, its influence and potential for innovation are confined to some facilities within the destination, while the many small businesses forming the tourism industry often react in a passive way. © 2012, © 2012 Walter de Gruyter.","inbound tourism; innovation; Japan; Takayama; tourist destination","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84917689625"

He points out that sustained export growth had not succeeded in increasing Chile's monetary share of global trade because of the relatively low price of Chile's primary exports. Furthermore, external markets had become saturated or experienced downturns such as the Asian crisis that restricted their ability to import Chilean products. As the dynamism of the export sector waned, domestic industrial production declined as free-trade policies encouraged imports. In the absence of antimonopoly policies, market forces favored the emergence of oligopolies and the formation of conglomerates, 15 of which dominate key sectors of the domestic economy to the detriment of smaller enterprises. Moreover, in what Cademartori describes as one of the most permissive foreign investment environments in the world, transnational capital has penetrated the most dynamic sectors of the Chilean economy, including investments in mining, agribusiness and forestry, communications, electrical power, banking, and finance, realizing profits more than double the world level and three times the Latin American average. Rather than halting the transfer of wealth from the poor to the rich, the Concertación has sustained it with additional privatizations, regressive consumption taxes, and tax breaks for business and the wealthiest individuals. Furthermore, despite neoliberal ideology, the Concertación has granted a wide variety of subsidies to the most influential corporations, many of them powerful transnationals, while cutting services to average Chileans. Cademartori concludes that neoliberalism is incompatible with true democracy because citizens lack real power, which has been consolidated in the hands of domestic and transnational economic elites to the detriment of the majority. He calls for going beyond Chile's formal democracy to one in which civil society is empowered and the state is responsive to majority interests, although he does not assess the likelihood that this will happen or propose specific means to bring it about.","","Chile; democratization; neoliberalism; poverty alleviation; social policy","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0141855081"

This passage of time and the recent economic downturn afford researchers the opportunity to evaluate the success of these regulations in encouraging fiscal responsibility. This paper provides both a quantitative analysis of the impact of BBL on expenditure growth and a qualitative assessment of BBL in Western Canada as these four western provinces confronted the Great Recession of 2008-09. On both accounts, our analysis suggests that BBL did not fare particularly well in terms of its original objectives. Our empirical analysis shows that BBL had no discernible effect in restraining expenditure growth relative to revenue growth in most provinces, leaving them in a vulnerable fiscal position to avert deficits during economic recession. We illustrate this vulnerability among Western Canadian governments when confronted with the Great Recession. In other words, BBL was neither strong enough to limit expenditure growth during the good times nor adequate to prevent governments from choosing to run deficits during the bad times. Our analysis suggests that, like any piece of legislation, BBL is only as effective as the political will and public support surrounding it.","Balanced budget legislation; Fiscal management; Great Recession; Provincial expenditures; Provincial revenues; Spline regression","Canada; economic conditions; economic growth; expenditure; fiscal policy; quantitative analysis","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84867526203"

This book offers powerful strategies for stemming the employment crisis and proposes comprehensive solutions for businesses, government, and job seekers alike. More than 30 million Americans are unemployed, underemployed, or have given up on looking for a job. Undoubtedly, the massive economic downturn after the financial crisis of 2007–2008 is a key factor in this situation. But the U.S. job market has stalled because our nation is failing to produce workers with the right skills, not because we cannot create enough jobs for the workers. Future Jobs: Solving the Employment and Skills Crisis offers an economic and historical perspective on the evolution of jobs and careers, explains how technology has permanently altered the U.S. job/labor market, and provides practical information for businesses seeking qualified workers, educators preparing students for careers, unemployed or underemployed individuals, and those interested in changing careers. The book examines the problem of the mismatch between individuals' skills and employers' job needs from the perspectives of both employers and employees or prospective employees, offering comprehensive regional solutions to the issues each group faces. The author reveals the most promising jobs and careers of the next decade for early-career job seekers and workers with established careers looking to change their path, and provides potential solutions to the jobs and skills disconnect in America, including education reform, business and government policy changes, and regional public-private partnerships. © 2013 by Edward E.

Voted ‘Best European Destination’ of the year three times since 2012, this mid-size city core area is experiencing an economic renewal after decades of neglect. Many of the new ventures are tourism-orientated: restaurants, bars, hostels, short stay apartments and specialised crafts shops are populating previously derelict eighteenth and nineteenth century buildings, bringing new life to previously depopulated streets. Most of these ventures are fronted by middle class individuals who saw their traditional economic outlets wither during the Portuguese economic crisis and consequent international bailout in 2011. This paper analyses a particular tourism venture: a walking tour of the city called ‘The Worst Tours’. The offspring of three architects, these tours differentiate themselves by not aligning within a hegemonic model of tourism that focuses on the built heritage of the UNESCO classification and its historical discourse on the city, offering instead a more politically engaged discourse in which the urban and social impacts provoked by Portugal’s economic downturn and the touristification of the city’s economy are highlighted and discussed with the tour participants. I will approach the tour through the lens of critical cosmopolitanism and the idea of a cosmopolitan imagination producing new relations between self, other and the world in moments of openness. © 2017, © 2017 Paula Mota Santos.

Design/methodology/approach: This is a conceptual paper that draws on prior conceptual and empirical studies, especially the innovation-based view of firm performance. Findings: Many firms have cut their innovation expenditures in response to the COVID-19 crisis. However, the financial crisis in 2008/2009 has shown that these short-term cost savings may have severely negative consequences on competitiveness. Several innovation examples from the crisis due to the COVID-19 pandemic further indicate that companies may benefit from a variety of first-order innovations, which go considerably beyond product development. Consequently, researchers and executives need to consider the variety of innovation types beyond product development, and they further need to emphasize second-order innovations, which describe the dynamic transformation of innovation management. Originality/value: Academics and practitioners need to put specific attention to the transformation of innovation processes at the beginning of a crisis because firms may have to redesign their innovation processes. This dynamic reconfiguration and realignment of innovation processes further is essential again if a crisis continues for a longer period, such as the crisis due to the coronavirus pandemic. For example, if a company currently does not respond to relevant trends, its competitive position will deteriorate because other companies will enter the market. If firms can afford to continue or strengthen the innovation activities, they may profit substantially after the crisis. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Competitive advantage; Coronavirus crisis; COVID-19 pandemic; Economic downturn; Innovation types; Innovation-based view","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85114478681"

Unemployment and inflation coupled with shrinking public and private sector budgets have made the operating environment difficult. The purpose of this paper is to discuss how the recession and the austerity measures that followed have affected UK events – and will continue to do so. Some previous research has argued that a downturn in the economy can stimulate creativity and innovation. This paper lends some support to this argument as it examines how the recession has forced the organising committee of one of Europe's most prestigious international youth football (soccer) tournaments to “think beyond the football” and start to look at innovative ways to off-set the cuts in its funding. The paper focuses on the Northern Ireland Milk Cup Youth Football Tournament, which is regarded as one of the most prestigious youth football tournaments in Europe. Based on data gathered from various stakeholders via interviews and focus groups the paper discusses how the tournament can generate extra revenue from gate receipts, corporate hospitality, merchandising, programming, sponsorship and marketing. Event organisers can learn two important lessons from this study: first, the current economic climate is challenging but they should try and think “outside the box” as challenges can present opportunities; and second, consult and collaborate with event stakeholders, as their insight and ideas may prove invaluable in these challenging times.

This relationship was confi rmed in the past several crises. However, the impact of economic downturns on structural unemployment will depend on many factors. The aim of the paper is to decomposite unemployment and we try to estimate the rate of structural unemployment. We also made an effort to determine the effects of the crisis on economic performance and functioning of the labour market in the Visegrad group countries. The analysis showed considerable sensitivity of these economies to the development of the external environment (except Poland), mainly through an export channel - the most affected was an industry sector, especially automotive industry. It seems to be important to have more diversifi ed structure of the economy, mainly the exports. Quarterly data from the Eurostat LFS database in the period between 2000 and 2014 were applied. In order to estimate the trend of the unemployment rate’s development was used Hodrick-Prescott filter. Data show that all observed economies recorded a low unemployment rate in a pre-crisis period and they had to face worsened labour market performance during and after the crisis. Our results suggest that structural component seems to be the most important component of total unemployment. Moreover, it has decreased in these countries, except Hungary. We also compared our approach with an OECD approach which is based on employment of Kalman fi lter. Results suggest that both methods, although they are based on different processes, lead to analogous results. © 2016, Technical University of Liberec.

We demonstrate that the more unequal are societies, the higher the probability of experiencing democratic improvements following economic downturns. Following growth periods, higher income inequality has a slight negative or null effect on the likelihood of democratic improvement. The conditional result provides a simple explanation for why previous literature has found largely null results concerning inequality and democratization and offers additional evidence in support of the new economic view. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Democratization; Distributive conflict; Inequality; Window of opportunity","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85079157724"

The latest upturn in mortgage arrears, from 2004, has been exacerbated by recessionary pressures since 2006. Despite significant exposure to risk and a distinct configuration to the current recession, lenders initial responses in 2006 and 2007 to managing arrears were limited and unchanged from the 1990s. This paper explores the extent to which such practices then changed, why and with what consequences. The paper identifies a shift in lenders' responses to mortgage arrears and possessions from 'pay or possess' to more 'managed forbearance'. It explores the ways in which commercial considerations, housing market drivers, a more stringent regulatory environment and government intervention have influenced this change resulting in a slower than expected growth in possessions. The paper considers the contingent nature of these changes and the implication for the longer-term sustainability of homeownership. The paper is based upon a qualitative study of lenders' and government agencies' responses to the current market downturn. The paper has a UK focus, but, in the context of global recession and significant homeownership markets in many developed countries, the issue of mortgage default and its management may resonate beyond the UK. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.","Lender forbearance; Mortgage arrears; Regulation","United Kingdom; economic instability; homeownership; housing market; lending behavior; management practice; mortgage lending; qualitative analysis","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-77953624451"

Further, some economists are promulgating for a new development strategy of domestic demand-led growth. Hence, this article tries to examine the role of domestic and external demand to growth in BRICS countries. Domestic investment is taken to explore the impact of domestic demand on growth, while export and import variables are used to investigate the role of external demand in economic growth. To cater to the objective, causality analysis is done among exports, imports, domestic investment and economic growth using the vector auto regression analysis. Generalized impulse response functions are plotted to get an insight of dynamic interrelationships among these variables.

The period selected captures the global downturn, which serves as a useful platform on which the short-run effects on CS labour productivity and labour market reactions can be identified. Using Geary-Khamis dollars, in purchasing power parity terms, enables comparative analysis across the four selected, transition countries to be carried out in respect of these components. The work finds that income per head, driven by labour productivity, could be identified as increasing in the case of Poland only during this four-year period. Contrastingly, the Czech Republic, whose income per head is the highest within the group, was the only country to reveal positive labour productivity and labour market gaps relative to the average for all four countries.

The credit crunch has led to occupiers rethinking their strategic requirements, and, at the same time, they are fire fighting to keep their occupation costs at a level that will allow the companies to survive. This briefing note aims to look at the activity between landlords and tenants in the market to determine, indicatively, the changes that are happening due to the downturn. Design/methodology/approach: The paper uses an indicative survey and market commentary. Findings: In this market, more than any other, tenants are approaching landlords with the idea of renegotiating their rental liabilities. Landlords are considering each proposal on its merits and solutions are ranging from side agreements to not demand full payment, to surrender and renewals to provide a more even cash flow or outright surrenders with a reverse premium being paid. Practical implications: This paper looks at the UK market and the nature of agreements being made with a background of such uncertainty. The booming investment market of the last few years has shielded the profession from the need to consider fully the role of proactive management. This paper argues that good relationship management and a foresight to negotiate to protect future cash flows means that, now more than ever, management surveyors can enhance and protect capital values. Originality/value: This paper provides an insight into the confluence of requirements between landlords and tenants in a market driven by a lack of capital and access to borrowings on both sides. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Economic change; Investments; Leasing; United Kingdom","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-77957296582"

However, unemployment has had a differential impact on different population groups. Compared to natives, immigrant workers have experienced higher rates of job loss. Against this backdrop, this paper examines the differences between immigrants and natives (distinguished by gender) in terms of their probability of suffering job loss in the downturn of late 2008 and 2009. Our results indicate that the higher rate of job loss among female immigrant workers can be fully explained by their lower endowment of human capital. By contrast, human capital endowment and over-representation in certain occupations, sectors and regions in which the crisis had greatest impact do not appear to be the only reasons for the penalty suffered by immigrant males in terms of their chances of losing their job in the downturn. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Crisis; Immigration; Job loss; Labour market segregation; Spain","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84943588684"

The rise in costs and decline in sales have led to serious problems in the auto industry. In order to address these issues, most companies engage in downsizing and redesigning production operations. It is crucial to investigate the time wasted by replacing assembly boards occurring in manufacturing lines. Therefore, the aim of this study was to provide an integrated approach, Teoriya Resheniya Izobreatatelskih Zadatch (TRIZ), to providing efficient solutions for the automobile industry. The first step of this methodology is to detail the technical problems using the Function and Attribute Analysis (FAA) model. Secondly, a contradiction matrix and the inventive principle were applied to find the solutions. In this study, an auto part supplier named Sumi-Hanel located in Hanoi, Vietnam, was taken as a case study; the empirical results showed that waste time had been reduced to 67%, nearly 8400 square meters was saved, and a 20% cost reduction was achieved by reusing old frames. The research proves that the combination of TRIZ and lean manufacturing successfully increases production performance and reduces waste due to technological advancements. © 2016 by the authors.","Automobile industry; Contradiction matrix; Function and attribute analysis model; Lean manufacturing; TRIZ","Hanoi; Japan; Viet Nam; analytical method; automobile; automobile industry; empirical analysis; innovation; manufacturing; matrix; performance assessment; spatiotemporal analysis; sustainable development","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84971003164"

The focus is set on the standpoints of actors in local government and their interface with the broader structures. The aim is to create a productive dialogue with evolutionary economic geography studies paying attention to actors and resilience studies where the human perspectives in adaptation are emphasised. The town of Lieksa, Finland, is used as a case study to exemplify a forest resource periphery located in relative isolation at the regional and national scale, but within a developed economy in Europe. The results, based on interviews with key local policy-makers, show that development did not stop at the time of the first bust despite the domination of the downturn. The study reveals two waves of restructuring which both include a type of regional bust followed by different kinds of institutional recovery. In general, the human adaptation appears as reactions reflecting the variation of giving up, forward-looking acceptance, desperate resistance, re-orientation with external support and search for renewal with an optimistic attitude. Above all, the resilience regarding the local governmental actors emphasises their flexible adaptability and ability to develop institutional capacities to tolerate their vulnerability, the uncertainties of the economic future and the difficulties of locals to influence it - and if anything - to act and bounce forward in spite of repetitive busts and restructuring phases. © 2019 by the author.","Evolutionary economic geography; Local decision-making; Narrative analysis; Peripheralisation; Regional resilience; Resource periphery","Finland; adaptive management; decision making; economic geography; ecosystem resilience; forest resource; local government; long-term change; policy making; resource availability","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85070219795"

We adapt a model from the literature on irreversible investment and use it to examine the trade-off between flexibility to adjust the labor force and higher productivity stemming from the greater commitment of the firm to its employees. In the model, two types of contracts with otherwise identical workers can coexist. One possibility is for firms to commit to a permanent employment contract that precludes dismissal at will. The alternative is a temporary employment contract that allows flexibility to adjust the firm's labor force during demand downturns, but involves higher labor cost per unit of output. Using an example, we illustrate the possible magnitude of the value of flexibility and suggest that adopting long-term contracts in the wrong environment can significantly reduce firm value. The model yields predictions for the optimal labor force composition and its relation to the characteristics of the firm's market. We also consider practices that develop to complement permanent employment. The predictions are then examined in light of evidence on the HR practices in Japan and the United States in the past 50 years and are found to be consistent with the stylized facts in the literature.

It is not a question of competitiveness Europe is doing well on global markets. We cannot blame our main trading partners, or low-wage countries, for our shortcomings. And we should not blame fiscal policies, the convergence process. The reasons behind unemployment are internal to Europe. There are two distinct explanations. One has been our inability to tackle macroeconomic shocks in a coordinated way. As a consequence, downturns have been deeper and recoveries weaker than they need have been. The resultant low average rates of economic growth produced inadequate job creation relative to the growth of the potential workforce. The other explanation has been our inability to reform labour market policies and social protection systems to meet the labour market needs of today. Europe's policies were originally created for labour markets with one male breadwinner, working in manufacturing or construction. Labour market and social policies focused on ensuring income support to individuals and families through unemployment benefit, disability pension and early retirement schemes to off-set the effects of cyclical unemployment or ill-health. Those labour market conditions have changed, and there are new challenges to be faced, notably the spread of new technology. Discord between the traditional policy mix and the reality of modern economic and social life has contributed to the low employment rate in Europe and the high dependency ratio. Reform is required. A good safety net during periods of unemployment must be maintained, but the urgent need is to create a springboard to new skills and new jobs. There are now two distinct political responses to these two shortcomings. The first is Economic and Monetary Union with the single currency. The second is an emerging Employment Union, based on the new Treaty, the Luxembourg Summit and the new employment strategy. Together they form a convergence programme for higher employment and lower unemployment. The purpose of these Europe-wide policies is to create both macroeconomic stability and labour markets that are adaptable to change, offering flexibility for enterprises and security for workers. The employability of job seekers, and of the workforce as a whole, must be given the same attention as monetary targets. That is the reason for the Luxembourg agreement on quantified targets for the fight against unemployment, based on a preventive strategy with a strong commitment to employability measures. In a few weeks and months we will be turning a page in the book of European history, when the third stage of EMU is established and the single currency becomes a reality. It has already given a new credibility to Member State economic policies, with lower inflation and lower real interest rates than we have had for more than 15 years, and better investment, growth and employment prospects. The strength of this system has been proved during the turnoil that has followed the monetary crises in the Asian economies. At the same time we are entering into a new convergence project, the employment strategy, with the purpose of convergence towards lower unemployment and higher employment. Now it is time to focus on the capacity of the real European economy: on the growth and employment potential of Europe as an economic entity, and on the substantially under-used working age population in Europe. Given our low employment rate, the EU has an additional growth potential of 25-30 million people compared with our main trading partners, Japan and the USA to add to the steady increases in Europe's economic capacity through productivity improvements. This leads to two questions: will the Member States take the necessary employability measures, to release this potential, to invest in people to make it possible to reduce the dependency on social protection? And, will the monetary system, i.e. the money markets and the Central bank, recognize that an active labour market policy gives room for stronger, employment-creating, growth in Europe without the risk of a resurgence of inflation? In this perspective, we need to rethink and develop our analytical tools for understanding and defining labour market performance and flexibility. The NAIRU-concept and the OECD Labour Standard Index reflect the thinking of the past (regulation versus deregulation), rather than the present and the future (both flexibility and security). The EU Commission has started an analysis designed to develop new concepts and new analytical tools, reflecting the new employment strategy. We need to assess the real determinants and measures of ‘success’ in terms of long-run investment, growth and employment factors like the extent to which we fully use our available labour resources; the scale of our human resource investment; the degree of working time flexibility; the quality of our industrial relations; the mastery of new technology. It is my hope that this 1998 Meidner Lecture could serve as a starting point for a constructive debate on new analytical tools for the shaping of more successful relations between employment and economic policies in Europe. Here, economists especially labour economists can make an important contribution to the process of policy modernization. © 1998, SAGE Publications Ltd.

Objective: Our purpose is to understand whether immigrant workers are suffering more from the downturn and, if so, to disentangle whether this is related to being an immigrant or to specific characteristics that make immigrants different from natives. Methods: We use longitudinal data from the Italian Labour Force Survey to compare immigrant and native workers, matched for observable personal, household, and job characteristics by propensity score methods. Results: Immigrant workers face a higher probability of ending an ongoing employment spell because their characteristics are more likely associated with higher separation rates, while, when comparing similar workers, differences with natives disappear. In 2009 job separations increased for all male workers, but the impact was stronger for immigrants, mainly because of their characteristics. On the contrary, both groups of female workers showed a slightly lower probability of losing a job in 2009, so that observed differences remained the same before and after the downturn. Conclusions: The impact of the downturn differs markedly by gender, with only male workers being affected. Among these, immigrants suffer more than natives, as their observable characteristics are more associated with losing a job. When comparing only comparable workers, immigrant status itself has no impact on separation rates. © 2013 Adriano Paggiaro.","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84884272679"

Drawing on research suggesting that discrimination increases during recessions, we test whether the racial wage gap expands during economic downturns. Using longitudinal wage data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics over a 40-year time period (N = 18,954), we find that the wage gap between Black and White workers increases with the unemployment rate. Moreover, we find that the cyclical wage gap is more pronounced in states in which Whites hold more negative attitudes about Blacks and in states with larger Black populations, suggesting that the racial wage gap expansion during recessions is at least partially driven by discrimination. Finally, we find evidence for at least two mechanisms by which the wage gap expands during recessions. First, we find that Black workers are more likely to lose their jobs during downturns and earn lower wages upon reemployment than comparable Whites. Second, we find that Black hourly workers are slightly more likely to have their hours reduced during recessions than White hourly workers, thereby resulting in lower earnings. These findings suggest that the racial wage gap widens during recessions and that discrimination accounts for at least some of this expansion. © The Author(s) 2020.","discrimination; earnings; race; unemployment; wage gap","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85096906144"

We investigate the employment of Wisconsin TANF leavers, contrasting outcomes among early leavers (1998) with those who left during the 2001 recession. We use data from administrative records on about 6000 welfare leavers, tracking quarterly employment for 3 years after they left benefits. Separate panel data analyses of those exiting in two different time periods show that individual leavers are less likely to be employed when their local unemployment rate is high in the later cohort; no relationship is found for the early cohort. In a panel analysis in which the cohorts are combined, we find that leavers in the later cohort, who experienced the recession early in their post-welfare career, are less likely to be employed, a result that holds controlling for observed and unobserved characteristics.

Ecological studies often report a positive relationship between economic downturns and population health while individual-level studies often show that conditions related to recessions are deleterious. Our study examines the spatially and temporally heterogenous effects of the Great Recession (TGR) on adverse birth outcomes, a contemporaneous measure of population health that is highly responsive to changing social conditions. Methods: We use restricted birth cohort data from California (2004–2012) merged with both county- and tract-level socio-demographic data, to explore birth selectivity and temporal and unemployment effects during TGR on adverse birth outcomes. Results: We find that gestational exposure – more specifically, second trimester exposure – during or adjacent to the months of TGR was generally deleterious for birth outcomes, more so, in some cases, for mothers with lower levels of education, and that increases in county-level unemployment were generally deleterious for birth outcomes. Conclusions: Although recessionary effects on population health are problematic and may have far-reaching effects, it appears that these effects may be largely universal, even given potential selective fertility favoring advantaged groups. © 2019 The Authors","Adverse birth outcomes; The great recession","adult; article; California; cohort analysis; controlled study; demography; education; female; human; human experiment; mother; outcome assessment; population health; pregnancy outcome; second trimester pregnancy; social status; unemployment","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85072558732"

While scholars often depict rural, working-class communities as objects of right-wing disinformation, posttruths, and alternative facts, how rural communities interpret or experience populist narratives is far from adequately understood. This research examines the recent coal industry recession in coal-producing areas of Appalachian Kentucky, which contributed to ten thousand job losses since 2010. Amid the downturn, politicians and pro-coal lobby groups riled the public by blaming the recession on an alleged “war on coal.” This article illustrates how neoliberal disinformation underpins war-on-coal narratives claiming that deregulating industry is the only way communities can save the industry and access economic well-being. Drawing from qualitative interviews, participant observation, and discourse analysis, I explore how war-on-coal disinformation becomes a commonsense explanation for many dealing with coal industry recession. While findings suggest that the war on coal “makes sense” for many living in coal-mining communities, this does not indicate an indeterminate embrace of the industry or pro-coal rhetoric. Communities negotiate commonsense narratives against complicated relationships with the industry, the many dangers of mining, and the challenges coal poses for alternative economic futures. © 2020 by the American Anthropological Association.","Appalachia; Common Sense; Disinformation; Energy; War on Coal","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85122024707"

However, during the past two recoveries, employment has taken up to three years to achieve its prerecession benchmark. We propose a formal empirical model of business cycles with recovery periods to demonstrate that the past two recoveries have been statistically different from previous experiences. We find that this difference can be attributed to a shift in the speed of transition between business cycle regimes. Moreover, we find this shift results from both durable and nondurable manufacturing sectors losing their cyclical characteristics. We argue that this finding of acyclicality in post-1980 manufacturing sectors is consistent with previous hypotheses (e.g., improved inventory management) regarding the reduction in macroeconomic volatility over the same period.

However, wavering investor attitudes and minimal exposure to real estate investment vehicles, coupled with weak regulatory frameworks, have led to dramatic downturns in the sector. Transparency about what is happening in real estate is imperative if the success of high-profile initiatives is to continue and much depends on good corporate governance (CG) in the sector. Using the most recent data from 2019, the current study applies the CG Index (CGI) and CG Deviation Index (CGDI) constructs to the real estate (RE) sector in the GCC in an effort to develop vital indicators for future RE investment decisions in the GCC region. The results indicate that the highest CG adherence levels are being achieved in Dubai, followed by Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia. The authors attribute these countries’ success in CG adherence to the entrepreneurial identity of them RE firms as well as to their governance capacity, their socio-cognitive capability, and the level of regulatory enforcement within the context of their dominant governance logic. It should be noted that there are variations in adherence levels throughout each region. The results also agree with prior literature that a higher CGS leads to a lower CGD score, and vice versa. At this point, encouraging more real estate investment trust (REIT) formations in the GCC could ensure value propositions, such as liquidity, to both investors and RE companies as well as solid governance fundamentals. This is strongly recommended for increasing the RE presence and its contribution to the GDP of each country. © 2021 by the authors.","corporate governance deviation index; corporate governance index; GCC countries; real estate","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138598878"

Sociologists are often concerned with identifying the conditions under which states implement a particular social policy. As such, we ask what conditions separate states that have implemented drug testing policies for welfare applicants from those that have not. Using discrete-time event history analysis models we test several existing theories of policy creation, namely group threat and partisan politics. Results indicate that declines in white labor force participation, and possessing a Republican governor, are positively associated with the passage of welfare drug testing policy. Contrary to explanations given by political operatives, neither state fiscal conditions, nor welfare caseloads, are statistically associated with passage. Our results re-affirm the association between racial and economic threat and reactionary social policy, as well as underscore the importance of political power in implementing such policy.

As a result, both countries are forecast to have larger economies than the U.S. or EU in the years ahead. Still, in the last year, signs of a slowdown have hit these two giants. Which way will these giants go? And how will that affect the global economy? Any Western corporation, investor, or entrepreneur serious about competing internationally must understand what makes them tick. Unfortunately, many in the West still look at the two Asian giants as monoliths, closely controlled mainly by their national governments. Inside Out, India and China makes clear how and why this notion is outdated. William Antholisa former White House and State Department official, and the managing director at Brookings-spent five months in India and China, travelling to over 20 states and provinces in both countries. He explored the enormously diversity in business, governance, and culture of these nations, temporarily relocating his entire family to Asia. His travels, research, and interviews with key stakeholders make the unmistakable point that these nations are not the immobile, centrally directed economies and structures of the past. More and more, key policy decisions in India and China are formulated and implemented by local governments-states, provinces, and fast-growing cities. Both economies have promoted entrepreneurship, both by private sector and also local government officials. Some strategies work. Others are fatally flawed. Antholis’s detailed narratives of local innovation in governance and business-as well as local failures-prove the point that simply maintaining a presence in Beijing and New Delhi-or even Shanghai and Mumbai-is not enough to ensure success in China or India, just as one cannot expect to succeed in America simply by setting up in Washington or New York. Each nation is as large, vibrant, innovative, diverse, and increasingly decentralized as are the United States, Europe and all of Latin America … combined. China and India each have their own agricultural heartlands, high-tech corridors, resource-rich areas, and powerhouse manufacturing regions. They also have major economic, social, environmental challenges facing them. But few people outside these countries can name those places, or have a mental map of how the local parts of these countries are shaping their global futures. Organizations, businesses, and other governments that do not recognize and plan for this evolution may miss that the most important changes in these emerging giants are coming from the inside out. “This book is for people who wonder about the inside of China and India, and how different local perspectives inside those countries shape actions outside their borders. Though my family and I spent five months traveling in both countries to do research, this book is not a travelogue. Rather, it is an attempt to sketch how a few of China’s and India’s many component parts are being shaped by global forces-and in turn are shaping those forces-and what that means for Americans and Europeans conducting diplomacy and doing business there.”from the Introduction. © 2013 The Brookings Institution.","","","Book","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84946826470"

Its regulation certainly is no ordinary policy initiative. No one should be surprised, therefore, that reaching principled choices about its substantive scope requires more than routine policy analysis. A purely political calculus will likely result in legislation that ignores urgent human needs while providing environmentally counterproductive subsidies to current polluters. Pending legislation to address carbon-emissions includes large subsidies for existing emitters. These subsidies make little sense economically or politically. Worse, they divert resources needed to address two crucial issues that the proposed legislation largely ignores: the impact of raising carbon costs on lowincome people and the effects of the pending legislation on the massive structural federal deficit. A carbon tax or cap-and-trade system would substantially increase costs not only for transportation but also for food and housing. With poverty levels rising even before the current economic downturn, the consequences of these price increases could be dire. Even without the pending legislation, the structural deficit will require deflationary tax increases or spending cuts. Combining carbon regulation with these measures could do severe damage. Although few challenge their merits, these proposals may nonetheless fail if a consensus emerges that they are extraneous to climate change legislation. Overly complex legislation often bogs down, and we lack coherent normative principles for ""issue joinder"" in public policy debates. Such principles can be derived and can counsel how we address both low-income subsidies and deficit reduction as part of climate change legislation. Another challenge is finding efficient means to deliver subsidies without disrupting incentives to conserve. Energy companies are likely to divert proposed allocations for this purpose to writing off bad debt. Funding energyassistance programs will similarly crowd out existing resources. Prior piecemeal efforts to address high energy costs provide invaluable lessons on designing a system that offsets rising carbon costs without distorting consumers' incentives. The large majority of proceeds not needed for low-income subsidies should be reserved for deficit reduction.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-77951842316"

How states approach higher education cuts has the potential to exacerbate existing inequities among racially minoritized and low-income students and historically underfunded institution types. In this study, we document trends in higher education funding over time and use latent profile analysis to identify distinct approaches states have taken to higher education funding. We then examine the trajectories of higher education funding within each approach over time, particularly during prior recessions. We conclude by discussing the implications of each approach for equity, particularly in light of states’ early responses to the current economic downturn. © The Author(s) 2022.","COVID-19; equity; financial aid; higher education; state funding; state policy","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85130251639"

During 2008-2009, most European countries faced a considerable slowdown in economic growth and an increase in unemployment levels. Theoretically, this would lead us to expect strong economic effects on incumbent support. However, recent academic work suggests that diminishing clarity of responsibility makes it increasingly difficult for voters to attribute blame for economic outcomes, consequently making punitive voting less likely. Has the sanctioning-rewarding mechanism then changed over time? Was economic voting more or less pronounced during the crisis than it was prior to the economic downturn? Analyzing the European Election Studies (EES) data for 12 Western European countries in 1989, 1994, 2004, 2009 and 2014, this paper finds support for neither proposition: there is very little abrupt change in economic effects over time. The statistical relationship between the economy and voting remained remarkably constant and was not subject to short-term fluctuations, even after the most dramatic economic recession in our lifetime. The stability of economic voting is particularly noteworthy considering that levels of voter dissatisfaction with national economic performance skyrocketed in 2009. © 2017 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.","economic crisis; economic voting; Europe; incumbent support","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85040904844"

Driven by austerity and economic downturns, many scholars agree that governments are increasingly relying on charity as a response to poverty. Taking Australia as a case study, this article demonstrates how the decayed welfare state is not just about outsourcing welfare provision to charities, but also a part of a broader project to cultivate a society in which social problems are responded to through spontaneous, community-led initiatives, powered by the ethical commitment of everyday citizens. We show how this project produces poverty through welfare state retrenchment, whilst simultaneously cultivating charity through material and symbolic support from the state. This results in the construction of charity as an end in itself, with little consideration given to its effectiveness in alleviating poverty.  © 2021 The Author(s).

The recent economic downturn of the Greek economy stresses the need for redefining current business models, attitudes and practices.; Design/methodology/approach - The authors draw from prior literature on strategic corporate responsibility and build their arguments on the value of social responsibility as an important component of an exit strategy from the domestic economic crisis.; Findings - Promoting the social responsibility of business could yield win-win opportunities for Greek firms and have a positive effect on the regeneration of the national economy's dynamics. Connecting the well-established strategic CSR literature with the specific handicaps of an economy under pressure, we point out that the current deep crisis can be alleviated by regaining the trustworthiness, supporting the competitiveness potential and enhancing the extroversion of the Greek economy.; Practical implications - Strategic options from which policymakers and managers can endorse the development of a CSR agenda as an exit strategy component are set forth. Such practical implications pertain to the creation of an enabling environment for strategic CSR implementation, an emphasis on CSR-related amelioration of competitiveness parameters and a redefinition of market orientation of domestic firms under the scope of socially responsible business behaviour.; Originality/value - An economic-business environment under extreme pressure is discussed; problems relevant to the Greek case are outlined while a new approach in the way of doing business is proposed.","Business strategy; Corporate social responsibility; Economic crisis; Greece; Proposition development","","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84917678136"

Assuming a central role in the productive process, these largely ""low-skilled"" immigrants came to form a reserve army of labor in the fragmented service-sector economy of the Lisbon Metropolitan Area. Although they come from diverse backgrounds and belong to different migratory phases, Cape Verdeans continue to be concentrated in the most precarious and poorly paid strata of the Portuguese labor market. The tenuous situation of most Cape Verdean immigrants has made them especially vulnerable to the post-2010 economic downturn and the accompanying IMF-mandated structural changes and liberalization measures. In this paper, I examine the trajectory of four Cape Verdean workers in the Portuguese labor market prior to 2010 and during the current ""crisis economy.""

In addition to exploring this sequence of events, I contextualize these case studies within the extant literature on precarity. In this regard, I identify a temporal gap in concept of precarity as it has been theorized to date.

Recent developments have highlighted the value and importance of articulation agreements as they relate to the transfer of accounting course credits, primarily the Principles of Accounting course, from two-year (i.e., community) colleges to four-year universities. Most of these developments are financial in nature, with some directly related to the current economic downturn. For instance, the steady rise in education costs has effectively shuttered access to four-year colleges for millions of students, many of whom will choose the lower-cost alternative of two-year community colleges. Given that approximately 40 percent of accounting students at two-year institutions currently report plans to transfer into four-year programs, effective articulation agreements become vital to the future of accounting education and the accounting profession. This paper discusses the benefits and limitations of articulation agreements as they pertain to a range of constituents, including students, faculty, administrators of two- and four-year colleges, and state policymakers. The paper offers best practices and future research opportunities regarding the most effective facilitation of credit transfer for the Principles course.

The global healthcare market is expanding rapidly, and entrepreneurship in the nursing sector is also predicted to grow. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to analyze the effects of the Start-Up NurseS program, developed using a management strategy simulation technique, on entrepreneurial attitude, entrepreneurial intention, entrepreneurial self-efficacy, entrepreneurship, and entrepreneurship education demand among nursing students. DESIGN: A randomized control trial with repeated measures. SETTINGS: Four nursing departments in two metropolitan cities. PARTICIPANTS: We assigned 34 nursing students to the experimental group and 33 to the comparison group. METHODS: Nursing students in the experimental group participated in the Start-Up NurseS program for four weeks. Post-intervention data were collected three times: immediately after the program, at four weeks, and at eight weeks. RESULTS: Entrepreneurial attitude, entrepreneurial intention, entrepreneurial self-efficacy, and entrepreneurship were more positive in the experimental group than in the control group. In the former, entrepreneurial attitude, entrepreneurial intention, entrepreneurial self-efficacy, and entrepreneurship showed significant differences immediately after the program, four weeks later, and eight weeks later.

Spain was at the forefront of this strategy and introduced legislation in 1986 to enshrine the worker self-managed company, Sociedades Laborales, as a policy for corporate restructuring. This article reports on the research in Spain conducted into company failure due to insolvency and the subsequent rescue by an employee-centred equity buyout. Seven firms in the metals industry are examined where workers rescued insolvent factories using the Sociedades Laborales democratic model.

Scientific discoveries and technological innovations requiring long-term commitment and investment are thus likely to suffer from higher rates of future discounting in times of economic insecurity. At the same time, governments are pressed for counter-cyclical measures in economic downturns, since recessions create large demands for compensatory spending for people and sectors at risk. This study explores how government investment in science and technology responds to economic downturns with a panel analysis of the data from 21 OECD nations for the period 1981-2011. Drawing on the varieties of capitalism (VoC) theory, the study explores how institutional complementarities underlying different regimes of political economy influence the downturn behavior of government-funded R&D. The empirical evidence presented here is largely supportive of the VoC conjecture, showing that government R&D funding is distinctly counter-cyclical in coordinated market economies. © The Author 2013.

Key factors examined include some unique characteristics of small and family businesses (e.g., entrepreneurial vision, entry niche, resources and capabilities, major challenges, and strategic options to go international) and social institutional variables (e.g., culture, economic system, government regulations, and institutional reforms both at home and abroad), which may assist or hamper an entrepreneur's capability to create, build, and expand a new venture within the national context or across borders. The primary focus of the study is to explore how small and family businesses triumph over barriers in the time of economic downturns. It expands prior research on entrepreneurship by developing a contextual global strategic framework for entrepreneurial firms. Country-firm specific examples are incorporated to illustrate ways to assess and exploit market opportunities, including firm registration procedures and costs, capital formation, and fund raising. Through this endeavor, the study provides practical implications for small business owners and managers as they attempt for resource acquisition and capability development, particularly in the rapidly globalizing industries.

Drug trafficking has spawned much of this crime which includes murders, aggravated burglary and, in some cases, kidnapping. There is little doubt that the structures and networks of criminal activity have developed with the collusion of persons in the public and private sectors and have probably infiltrated officers in the police forces themselves. The present rate of increase in crime parallels a downturn in the economies of the region occasioned by their loss of preferential markets in the European Union for their major commodities, a decline in tourism, an increase in unemployment and a drop in the real value of earnings. CARICOM states are in danger of being overrun by criminal activity in the decade ahead unless the problem is addressed urgently and comprehensively. The international community-particularly the countries whose demand for illegal narcotics has contributed significantly to the development of the Caribbean as a transhipment centre-has failed to help the region implement policies to control and prevent crime. Indeed, there is evidence that they have been withdrawing support from the area. There is an urgent need for the early convening of a limited international conference on crime in the Caribbean to mobilize resources to help CARICOM states deal effectively with the overwhelming problem of crime. The alternative is the constant erosion of the economic, social and political stability of the region and an escalation of transnational crime with all the dire consequences this may hold for the security of the wider global community.","Caribbean; Crime; Drug trafficking; Kidnapping; Security","Caribbean Islands; crime; drugs trade; regulatory approach; security threat","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0042014480"

In this way, economic globalization can be likened to state formation: as a cultural project with the object of actively suppressing alternatives. While undermining the regulatory capacity of local publics to tame markets, transnational legality prefers to draw on the normative ideas of comparative advantage, consumer freedom, and the rule of law. These discursive strategies prove an unstable basis for legitimation without the critical supports provided by national states in gaining and maintaining the consent of local publics. As the findings of a recent international arbitration panel indicate (CMS v. Argentina), transnational legality prefers to view the local as a threat to the maintenance of its political-economic order, one of open borders free of rent-seeking public regulation. This will be the case even when states, like Argentina, take measures to mitigate the hardships of a severe economic downturn. Some critical theorists, like Hardt & Negri in Empire, similarly relegate the local to a marginal place without appreciating its contradictory but sustaining role in globalization's future. Such theoretical interventions, operating in conjunction with the disciplining effects of globalization's legal order, help to immobilize, rather than empower, resistance to the monocultures of transnational legality. The question remains whether the shaky foundations upon which the legitimacy of transnational legality are structured will prove less durable than its immobilizing effects.

In this article we study the effects of a set of more flexible rules–discretionary tax depreciation (DTD)–introduced in the Netherlands during the 2009–2011 economic crisis. Our simulation results show DTD, which allows firms to accelerate and also to postpone depreciation, to be much more effective than bonus depreciation in reducing the expected value of tax payments, especially in crisis periods. Using a sample of 325 clients of a single office of a Dutch accounting firm, we show that DTD has led to higher investments in assets qualifying for discretionary depreciation for firms that faced the highest marginal tax rate. For other firms, the additional investments crowd out investments in assets that do not qualify for DTD. Our analysis on the actual depreciation choices reveals that firms postpone depreciation when facing losses or loss carry forwards, or to smooth taxable income under the progressive tax system. Our results suggest that a fiscal policy that permits firms to postpone depreciation, as well as to accelerate, may stimulate investment. © 2017 The Author(s).

Design/methodology/approach: We use a monthly panel of 51 commercial banks for the period 1996:4–2014:8. Findings: An increase in the monetary policy interest rate significantly reduces bank loan growth. The magnitude of this effect depends on banks’ financial structure. Additionally, we identify an asymmetric effect in which the bank lending channel is stronger in monetary contractions than during expansions. We show that this behavior is due to the heterogeneous response of banks with different levels of solvency. This finding has important implications for the design and implementation of monetary policy and coordination of central bank’s policy with key economic agents. Practical implications: The fact that the BLC is stronger in times of monetary contraction is quite interesting for central banking, as it shows that monetary policy transmission is harder during macroeconomic downturns. When investment plans are depressed, monetary stimulus may prove insufficient to reactivate credit demand. This has proven to be true in advanced economies after a strong recession and our results suggest that is also true in emerging market economies for economic downturns in general. Central banks may have to provide stronger shocks to reactivate private credit when the economy is facing a slow economic recovery. Originality/value: Our findings point out that an increase in the monetary policy interest rate significantly reduces bank loan growth. However, the magnitude of this effect critically depends on two aspects. First, bank heterogeneity matters. Particularly, the loan supply of better capitalized banks is less sensitive to monetary policy shocks. Second, the response of credit supply to shifts in short-term interest rates critically depends on the monetary policy stance. The BLC is stronger in times of monetary contraction than during expansions. Moreover, we show that this asymmetric behavior is due to the heterogeneous response of banks with different levels of solvency to the monetary policy stance. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Bank financial structure; Bank lending channel; Colombia; Heterogeneous effects; Monetary policy transmission; Solvency","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85085088687"

This article is an attempt to articulate a unif.ied and integrated interpretation of this socio-ecological crisis, based on a dialectical conception of the relationship between society and nature. The overaccumulation, rising organic composition of capital, and falling rate of prof.it play a central role in the analysis of this crisis and the articulation of its particular forms. As argued, capital's strategic response to crisis and the deep restructuring of capitalism cannot ensure ecological and social sustainability, and more importantly the requirements of a socially acceptable human development. While there is some evidence of a recurrent accumulation and crisis, we are rather witnessing a secular downturn of capitalism and all attempts or tendencies towards "" dematerialization"" or ""decoupling"" of capitalist production (and growth) from its detrimental ecological impact fail to efffectively encounter the root causes of crisis. An attempt is f.inally made to draw the ""broad contours"" of an alternative, communist outlook in overcoming this socio-ecological crisis, and a working-class strategy ensuring the conditions of sustainable human development and an ecologically compatible society. © 2013 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden.","capital; communism; falling rate of profit; nature-society metabolism; organic composition of capital; socio-ecological crisis; sustainability","","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84894053441"

In 2008, social workers in Ireland began operating within the greatest period of economic recession since the 1930s. This recession poses a serious threat to the human rights of conventional social work clientele. Simultaneously, a dearth of articles has been published which address the topic. The present paper provides a focused commentary on the literature through the application of an anti-oppressive framework (AOF). The tripartite framework is constructed based upon demarcationist, incorporationist and egalitarian agendas, and was selected for its capacity to address the multifaceted nature of social oppression as identified within the literature. The paper begins with an overview of the impact of the recession on social work practice and its conventional clientele. It then provides a justification and explanation of the elected AOF. Each agenda within the framework is critically evaluated in terms of its broader expression both during and post recession. This evaluation is then used to inform a critical discussion on what lessons may be learned for social work policy and practice moving forward. © 2016 British Association of Social Workers.","anti-oppressive; economic recession; social work","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84976277157"

Design/methodology/approach – A variety of factors explains the differences in the prices of single-family houses. Changes in disposable income over time and across regions as well as the cost of capital are important determinants. The model is based on a DiPasquale and Wheaton model where the developments of the house prices are a function of macroeconomic factors such as economic growth, changes in employment and interest rate. It is estimated on a two-equation error correction model: first, the long-run price equation and, second, a short-run price model. Findings – The estimates suggest that the speed-of-adjustment ranges from 16 to 78 per cent (around 50 per cent on average) depending on the region. In regions with a low population density, higher price adjustment rates are observed. Moreover, the speed-of-adjustment is higher in an upturn economy than in a downturn reflecting that negative housing stock adjustments is much slower than positive adjustments. Originality/value – The main contribution is that the speed-of-adjustment to the long-run equilibrium price for 21 regions is estimated instead of at a national level and, furthermore, cyclical asymmetry in responses is tested and such differences are found.

Owing to the involvement and diversification of international foreign economic relations, regions can acquire significant additional profits from foreign economic activity.

This article analyzes the specific features and the main trends of Russia's foreign economic activity, and describes the problems of development of foreign economic relations, as well as ways to solve them. It is likely that under the same conditions, the regions of the country and transnational companies that have extensive foreign economic activity will have insignificant losses during the crisis. This is due to their rather high level of competitiveness, and their ability to diversify during the period of shrinking sales and the downturn in the world economy. One of the main methods for developing foreign economic activity in the regions of Russia is the definition of the investment attractiveness of the region in foreign countries, the successful positioning of its capabilities and opportunities in relation to foreign partners. Foreign economic opportunities for the development of a certain region, as a rule, depend on the successful promotion of the developed strategy of social and economic development.

North's work that reform measures fall short of their aims if they are not underpinned by a complementary ideology. And, effectively, Japan is a case in point. Japanese-language records of debates between policy makers in 1999, after a decade of reform, show that they continued hold to a 'mental model' of a political economy that was of the preceeding high growth period and, indeed, much further in Japan's past.

Not surprisingly, interest in the sector over this period, from both the popular media and public representatives, declined. However, since the start of the downturn in Ireland's economic fortunes in late 2007, there has been a renewed interest in the sector. The Irish government's Food Harvest 2020 strategy has set ambitious targets for the expansion of the Irish agricultural fisheries and food sector, but the achievement of these targets will be dependent on overcoming a number of structural and environmental constraints.

If non-linear urbanization paths are the result of economic downturns consolidating progressively more volatile real estate markets, the present study investigates the impact of recent building cycles on long-term urban expansion in a Mediterranean city (Athens, Greece), using multiple clustering techniques run on a large set of building activity and socio-demographic indicators. Changes over time in building activity were evaluated considering 12 spatially-explicit indicators derived from the analysis of building permits released by Greek municipalities between 1990 and 2017. By referring to different analysis' scales (macro-scale: settlements, meso-scale: buildings, micro-scale: dwellings), indicators allow a comprehensive investigation of multiple dimensions and characteristics of construction markets at four-time intervals of 7 years each (1990-1996, 1997-2003, 2004-2010, 2011-2017). Spatio-temporal variability in building activity was further investigated considering 12 contextual indicators assessing the basic socio-demographic attributes of local municipalities. Cluster analysis allows identification of distinctive, local-scale responses of real estate markets to economic cycles (expansion-stagnation-recession) in both short- and long-term horizons and relate them to the dominant socio-demographic context. Density of new buildings, average floors per new building, density of buildings' additions and number of building permits per inhabitant were found to be the most sensitive indicators to economic downturns in the study area. Infrastructure-driven development, as a result of the 2004 Olympic Games, has produced relevant short-term alterations in residential construction markets, complicating urbanization trends at the local scale. Multi-scale indicators from building permit records provide a useful insight in the diachronic mechanisms of urban growth, with implications for regional planning and design of sustainable development practices. © 2019 by the authors.","Building characteristics; Economic cycle; Market segmentation; Mediterranean region; Metropolitan region","Athens [Georgia]; Georgia; Greece; United States; building; construction industry; demography; economic impact; environmental indicator; infrastructural development; market system; Mediterranean environment; metropolitan area; Olympic Games; regional planning; residential location; segmentation; spatial analysis; sustainable development; urban growth; urbanization","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85059988092"

UNESCO is a specialized agency of the U.N. system that promotes collaboration among its member countries in the fields of education, natural sciences, social and human sciences, culture, and communications and information. With an annual budget of approximately $326 million, it supports more than 2,000 staff members working at its headquarters in Paris and 65 field offices and institutes worldwide. UNESCO activities are funded through a combination of assessed contributions by member states to its regular budget, and voluntary contributions by member states and organizations. U.S. Policy The United States is a member of UNESCO and generally supports the organization's objectives. Over the years, however, some U.S. policymakers-particularly Members of Congress-have expressed strong concern with UNESCO's politicization and, as some have alleged, lack of budget discipline and anti-democratic leanings. These concerns led to the United States' decision to withdraw from the UNESCO between 1984 and 2003. Since the United States rejoined the organization, Members of Congress have demonstrated support for UNESCO-appropriating between $73 million and $84 million in assessed contributions per fiscal year, or about 22% of UNESCO's annual regular budget. At the same time, Members have maintained an ongoing interest in ensuring UNESCO runs as efficiently and effectively as possible, and that its policies and programs are in line with U.S. priorities. Palestinian Membership and U.S. Financial Withholding Since late 2011, UNESCO has received significant U.S. and international attention resulting from member states' decision to admit ""Palestine"" (the Palestinian Liberation Organization, or PLO) as a member. The Obama Administration and many Members of Congress vehemently opposed this action, maintaining that Palestinian statehood can only be realized through direct negotiation between Israelis and Palestinians rather than through membership in U.N. entities. The United States withheld approximately $80 million in FY2012 funding to UNESCO as required by two laws enacted in the 1990s that prohibit funding to U.N. entities that admit the PLO as a member (P.L. 101-246), and grant full membership as a state to any organization or group that does not have the internationally recognized attributes of statehood (P.L. 103-236). Despite these funding restrictions, the Obama Administration has stated that it does not intend to withdraw the United States from UNESCO. Reform Since UNESCO's establishment, member states have sought to improve the organization's effectiveness through reform. Many observers, including the United States, agree that UNESCO has successfully implemented various reforms, particularly during the time between the United States' decision to withdraw from the organization in 1984 and its return in 2003. At the same time, many experts argue that the organization needs additional reform. Weaknesses in UNESCO's organizational structure and culture, they contend, hinder its ability to fulfill its mission. The most recent wave of reform activities is driven by the findings of a 2010 Independent External Evaluation report commissioned by member states. The report recommends changing some of UNESCO's management processes, enhancing UNESCO's field presence, and strengthening the organization's governance mechanisms. Ultimately, the full impact of these and other reform efforts is unclear. Their success- and the success of any future reforms-will likely depend on how effectively both UNESCO and its member countries follow through on implementation. Issues for the 113th Congress The recent controversy over Palestinian membership-coupled with broad concerns about spending levels in light of the recent economic downturn-has prompted some policymakers and observers to review the U.S. relationship with UNESCO. Examples of issues being considered are described below. • The impact of the U.S. financial withholding on UNESCO's activities. Many experts agree that the U.S. withholding will adversely impact the scope and effectiveness of UNESCO's programs; however, there are disagreements regarding the extent of this impact. The full implications of the withholding remain to be seen and are largely dependent on how long the United States withholds funds and what fiscal actions, if any, UNESCO takes in response to the funding decrease. • The effectiveness of the U.S. withholding. Some policymakers argue that the legislative restrictions prompting the U.S. withholding are no longer relevant or effective and should be waived. Others, however, contend that waiving the legislation would undermine U.S. credibility and provide a ""green light"" for Palestine to apply for membership in entities across the U.N. system. • UNESCO's role in U.S. foreign policy. Some critics of UNESCO maintain that its activities do not reflect U.S. foreign policy interests. Supporters contend that the organization plays a key role in global issues that the United States views as strategic priorities, particularly education and science. • Challenges to UNESCO reform. A significant obstacle to UNESCO reform is governments' differing views on the organization's role in the global multilateral framework. Moreover, each UNESCO member state has its own foreign policy priorities, political agenda, and perceptions of how the organization should work. These differences can lead to disagreements on budgeting, programming and, as most recently demonstrated, membership. Looking Ahead A key issue facing the 113th Congress might be the level and extent of future U.S. engagement with UNESCO. The United States is currently a member of the organization with full voting rights in the General Conference (UNESCO's main decision-making body); however, the United States may lose these rights if it continues to withhold financial contributions. Lack of voting rights may lead to the United States having minimal influence within the organization. As such, the United States might choose to remain engaged with UNESCO to the extent possible, or to withdraw as it did in 1984. © 2013 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Some types of vacant land are unused but can be productive. Some may have natural resource value for inhabitants and provide green space such as parks space or green infrastructure. Once a city has too much vacant land, it may reflect a long cycle of depopulation and economic downturn. So, a lot of vacant lots is of concern in shrinking cities to change them into a valued commodity. In contrast, insufficient vacant land might hinder future growth and development. Since the vacant land can be a potential opportunity or threat to spur economic development, it is critical to understand vacancy pattern and its drivers and create appropriate policies for each city. By doing so, it would be possible to find the most effective land supply usage for cities having different characteristics and patterns of vacancy. Therefore, this study compares the pattern primary factors of vacancy of a growing city, Fort Worth and shrinking city, Chicago and evaluate whether each city has established planning policies for reducing negative effects and increasing efficient usages.

This decision was a surprise and did not end all the conflicting opinions expressed by economists. This matter was finally settled in July 2002 after a revision to the 2001 real gross domestic product showed negative growth rates for its first three quarters. A series of political and economic events in the years 2000-01 have increased the amount of uncertainty in the state of the economy, which in turn has resulted in the production of less reliable economic indicators and forecasts. This paper evaluates the performance of two very reliable methodologies for predicting a downturn in the US economy using composite leading economic indicators (CLI) for the years 2000-01. It explores the impact of the monetary policy on CLI and on the overall economy and shows how the gradualness and uncertainty of this impact on the overall economy have affected the forecasts of these methodologies. It suggests that the overexposure of the CLI to the monetary policy tools and a strong, but less effective, expansionary money policy have been the major factors in deteriorating the predictions of these methodologies. To improve these forecasts, it has explored the inclusion of the CLI diffusion index as a prior in the Bayesian methodology.

Drawing on the author’s fieldwork and secondary sources, the chapter analyzes representative cases of collective worker protests in manufacturing and service sectors between 2011 and 2015. Specifically, it examines: the changing composition of the workforce; the development of workers’ demands and their ability to organize; the tactics they utilize; and the ways in which workers’ protests have interacted with the official trade union and state labor laws and policies. Chinese workers have gained growing workplace bargaining power amid demographic shifts, a growing labor shortage, and changes in economic structures and state labor laws and policies. As such, workers have become more emboldened to redress grievances and demand better pay and working conditions from their employers. The protagonists and demands of labor protests have become more diverse as well. Furthermore, with the support of labor rights groups and the rapid development of social media in China, workers are increasingly well-organized, and they are able to stay united and elect their own representatives to engage in collective bargaining. The escalation of labor unrest in a wide range of industries has forced the Chinese government to oscillate between repression and accommodation, placing more pressure on the official trade union to reform and to be more responsive to workers’ grievances in order to better preempt strikes and maintain stability. Yet, at the same time, the Chinese government remains firmly in charge, and it has taken an increasingly repressive approach to worker activists and labor rights groups in the face of China’s recent economic downturn. These findings reveal important insights into the forms, expressions, potential, and limits of ongoing working-class resistance in present-day China, and how labor protest might progress in the coming decades. © Teresa Wright 2019.

In the 2008 recession, some poor families replaced their market incomes with cash assistance from Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF). Using secondary data for 42 contiguous jurisdictions and DC, we examined the relationship between increases in TANF caseloads and changes in substantiated child neglect cases in each of the contiguous jurisdiction’s 2008 recession. Key findings suggest that reductions in child neglect cases in the presence of increasing TANF caseloads were more profound in about half the states than any increases in child neglect cases found in the remainder of the states. Applying Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis tools, local spatial clusters were found in four neighboring states in the Midwest-South corridor suggesting that child neglect increases were similar and substantial across these four states. Our findings provide important information to stakeholders who may want to better target federal resources to specific geographic regions. Neighboring states experiencing large increases in child neglect during economic downturns may extend their collaborative efforts so they can develop strategies for improving services. Future research should explain the growth in child neglect with other variables aside from TANF caseloads. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Child neglect; great recession; impact of TANF on child neglect during the great recession; spatial analysis; spatial clusters; temporary assistance for needy families","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85052339565"

Consequently, investors now question loan-to-value (LTV) levels in their funds. Until recently, percentages around 50%-65% were common but never based on in-depth research or optimization. This paper examines the benefit of leverage using a simulation model to account for a multitude of scenarios and shows that portfolios with up to 40% LTV are still efficient. More leverage is likely to decrease return expectations. The reasons behind this conclusion are threefold: the disproportionately high cost of distress, asymmetric performance fees, and the impact of incremental interest rates.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84856182263"

Employees working in these organisations face employment uncertainty. The pandemic disrupted their daily routines, and it added a layer of complexity to the already resource-constrained environment. During these times, employees would conserve their resources to maintain competitiveness, one of which is knowledge hiding. While economic activities are resuming, the appearance of new variants could mean the transition towards endemicity could be put on hold. Hence, there is a need to rethink the behaviour of employees as they would have elevated levels of anxiety towards resuming daily work activities. Therefore, this study aims to address the question of understanding employees’ perspectives toward knowledge sharing and knowledge hiding. Design/methodology/approach: Drawing on the conservation of resources theory, social learning theory and the social exchange theory (SET), a conceptual framework involving ethical leadership was developed to examine if knowledge hiding or knowledge sharing behaviour is a resource for employees during these times. The partial least squares method of structural equation modelling was used to analyse results from 271 white-collar employees from Singapore. Findings: The results show that ethical leadership encourages knowledge sharing but does not reduce knowledge hiding. At the same time, knowledge hiding, not knowledge sharing, improves one’s perception of work performance. Additionally, psychological safety is the key construct that reduces knowledge hiding and encourages sharing behaviour. Originality/value: Overall, this study extends the theories, demonstrating that, first and foremost, knowledge hiding is a form of resource that provides employees with an added advantage in work performance during the endemic. At the same time, we provide a new perspective that ethical leaders’ demonstration of integrity, honesty and altruism alone is insufficient to encourage knowledge sharing or reduce knowledge hiding. It must lead to a psychologically safe environment. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","COVID-19; Ethical leadership; Knowledge hiding; Knowledge sharing; Psychological safety; Singapore; White-collar employees","Conservation; Economics; Knowledge management; Least squares approximations; Personnel; Philosophical aspects; Daily routines; Economic downturn; Ethical leadership; Knowledge hiding; Knowledge-sharing; Psychological safety; Singapore; Uncertainty; White-collar employee; Work performance; COVID-19","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138362878"

Despite their past survival, the current pandemic-induced crisis has cast doubt on informal economy resilience. This study aims to capture the informal economy resilience facing the unprecedented economic crisis triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic. We reviewed 42 selected peer-reviewed journal articles to synthesise a general concept of informal economy resilience during pandemic-induced crisis. We found that strict lockdown during a pandemic becomes the main driver that exacerbates the vulnerability of informal economy. The impacts are spatiotemporally varied, different within the group, and have multilevel characteristics (from individual to society). This vulnerable condition has triggered the informal economy to conduct several coping mechanisms to face economic disadvantages. Both individual coping mechanisms and government intervention have altered the informal economy's resilience throughout time. The current combination of defense mechanisms results in four possibilities: bounce back better, bounce back, recover but worsen, and collapse. This review offers valuable insights into the appropriate actions that governments should undertake in response to economic downturns resulting from pandemics. It highlights the importance of considering vulnerable groups when formulating policy during a crisis. © 2023, The Author(s).","COVID-19; Crisis; Informal Economy; Resilience; Socio-economic Impacts","COVID-19; crisis management; disease control; economic conditions; economic impact; epidemic; governance approach; informal sector; pandemic; policy approach; public health; socioeconomic impact; trigger mechanism; vulnerability","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85173120097"

Existing studies emphasize the crucial role of contrasting behavioral strategies, effectuation and causation in SMEs' adaptation to crisis conditions. Yet, prior literature concentrated predominantly on exploring the impact of effectuation and causation on firm performance rather than survival. The authors present and empirically test a theoretical model explaining how behavioral strategies affect SME survival during an economy-wide crisis under different levels of environmental dynamism. Design/methodology/approach: The authors propose a theoretical framework based on the combination of the effectuation literature and the emerging variance-based perspective on entrepreneurial actions. The theoretical model is then tested using a sample of Russian SMEs during a period of economic adversity and recovery (2015–2019). Findings: The empirical results reveal that causation reduces the probability of firm survival in dynamic environments, while effectuation increases the chance of survival irrespective of the state of the environment. In a nutshell, the study provides evidence that the effectuation logic serves a viable way for SMEs to increase the chances of survival through the economic shock and subsequent recovery period. Originality/value: For the first time in the literature, the authors demonstrate the role of behavioral strategy (effectual and causal) as a crucial antecedent of SME survival in the short and medium term, particularly during an economy-wide downturn. Furthermore, the study demonstrates the power of variability-based theorizing for explaining and predicting the survival/failure implications of entrepreneurial actions. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Causation; Crisis; Effectuation; SME; Survival","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85164094074"

This study examines how changes in socioeconomic conditions in Mongolia have affected fertility patterns in recent times. It also provides an outline of changes that have taken place in terms of pronatalist policies. Data are drawn from the Reproductive Health Survey of Mongolia conducted in 1998. Among the older cohort, the relationship between economic activity and fertility is inverse but weak, whereas among the younger cohort, the economic downturn has had a strongly depressing effect on fertility. Important effects of micro-level variables, including education and housing, are also noted. The findings suggest that the fertility decline observed for the older cohorts is part of the first demographic transition, in which the collapse of pronatalist policies was influential.","","Mongolia; birth rate; family planning; social change; socioeconomic conditions","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0036071596"

The decline in consumption can be attributed to distortions in the Euler equation (investment wedge). In addition, frictions creating a gap between the marginal rate of substitution and the marginal product of labor (labor wedge) contributed to the slowdown of the economy after 1936. This drop in the efficiency wedge might have resulted from financial frictions, whereas the investment wedge might have been caused by financial frictions due to agency costs.

In order to decompose the impact of changes in different income components, we utilised a microsimulation methodology and the EU-SILC User Database. This simulation based methodology involved the disaggregation of the 6 main benefit variables in the EU-SILC into 17 variables for our tax-benefit model. Validating, our results were positive, giving us confidence in our methodology. We utilised the framework to model changes in the level of income inequality from the period just before the crisis in 2004 to the depth of the worst year of the crisis in 2009. In terms of the impact of the economic crisis, we found that income inequality fell in the early part of the crisis modelled in this paper. Much of this change was due to rising inequality of market incomes, (even when discounting unemployment). This was due to the differential effect of the downturn on different sectors where some sectors such as the construction and public sectors were significantly hit, while the international traded sectors have been relatively immune from the downturn and have seen continued growth. The impact of the tax-benefit system has been to mitigate this upward pressure, with a gradual rise in the redistributive effect of the tax-benefit system driven by an increase in demand on the benefits side and increased progressivity on the tax side.

Inorder tohelp new graduates prepare for and successfully transition to the workplace, we must understand the experiences of these early career engineers. In this study, we identify and explain the career goals and actions ofearly career engineering graduates by answering the following questions: (1) How consistent are early career engineering graduates' career goals near the end of their undergraduate engineering studies with their future career plans? (2) What factors contribute to consistency in goals between these two pointsin time? Using Social Cognitive Career Theory, specifically the Social Cognitive Model of Career Self-Management, and a longitudinal, qualitative design, we analyzed interviews from 30 participants collected at two points in time: when participants were undergraduates and then later as early career engineering graduates. Participants were graduates from three different universities and were diverse with respect to sex, race, and undergraduate major. Results show that although early career engineering graduates had diverse goals, similar factors influenced career decisions. Participants generally wanted to find interesting work and focused their actions towards that goal. Family commitments geographically constrained career choices while also increasing the desire for stability.

The future for publicly funded libraries as institutions that promote learning, literacy, knowledge creation and entertainment is increasingly doubtful as publicly funded libraries across the country are seeing unprecedented levels of budget cuts. While the immediate cause of such reduced funding seems rooted in budgetary pressures, the reality is that library financial support is traditionally premised upon a publicly held assumption of goodwill for libraries and the societal benefits they represent. In order for libraries to survive the economic downturn and austerity measures put in place by government budgets, they need to rethink the role, purpose and benefits of library marketing in favor of a more sophisticated approach that conveys the unique value of their library and its offering to their specific user population. This paper aims to address this issue. Design/methodology/approach: Informed by the author's extensive experience in marketing information services, the paper discusses the current trends in library marketing, especially those aimed at conveying the value of libraries, and ties them to relevant scholarship in the areas of services marketing and value creation. Findings: Assumed goodwill is inadequate to the task of competing for financial support in a post-recessionary environment where expenditure of public funds is highly scrutinized. In order to survive long term, libraries of all kinds must take on a more sophisticated view of library marketing that focuses on value creation. Eliminating the old model of presumptive value in favor of one that utilizes the marketing process in order to communicate the competitive viability of libraries as place and content providers to their users in the form of targeted benefits that convey value, is critical. Simply put, if libraries hope to receive continued support in today's challenging fiscal climate they must elevate marketing to a critical operational function while focusing that marketing effort upon communicating the library's benefits and value to the users it serves. Practical implications: As a librarian, adjunct professor of marketing and former sales and marketing manager for a large information company, the author relies on his years of experience to convey a more purposeful sense of library marketing that is directed at communicating a library's unique value or worth to its users based upon an understanding of their needs, the benefits to them specifically as well as the competing options available to them in terms of information acquisition. Originality/value: The paper shares specific ideas regarding the purpose, role and benefits of library marketing that are connected to improving perceptions of the worth of libraries and the perception of value to a specific community as a means of engendering future support for them. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Austerity; Goodwill; Great recession; Library marketing; Library users; Public libraries; State and local budgets; Value creation; Value propositions","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-80052563341"

This study assesses whether exposure to economic downturns around retirement age leads to poorer cognitive function in later life. Method Longitudinal data for 13,577 individuals in the Health and Retirement Study were linked to unemployment rates in state of residence. Random-and fixed-effect models were used to examine whether downturns at 55-64 years of age were associated with cognitive functioning levels and decline at ≥65 years, measured by the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised. Results Longer exposure to downturns at 55-64 years of age was associated with lower levels of cognitive function at ≥65 years. Compared to individuals experiencing only up to 1 year in a downturn at 55-64 years of age, individuals experiencing two downturns at these ages had 0.09 point (95% Confidence Interval [CI,-0.17,-0.02]) lower cognitive functioning scores at ≥65 years (3 years: b =-0.17, 95%CI [-0.29,-0.06]; 4 years: b =-0.14, 95%CI [-0.25,-0.02]; ≥5 years: b =-0.22, 95%CI [-0.38,-0.06]). Downturns at 55-64 years of age were not associated with rates of cognitive decline.

Such a tendency is labeled as the demand for accountability in accounting, and the psychology behind this phenomenon is labeled more broadly as betrayal aversion in other fields such as sociology. Since the environment is not static for a decision maker, it is important to understand not only that betrayal aversion exists but also how/if its impact on individual decision making varies in response to environmental changes. In this study, we investigate if changed economic conditions (i.e., an economic downturn or upturn) would affect the level of betrayal aversion and its impact on a principal's internal control system choices. The results of our experiment suggest that while the level of betrayal aversion does not change with changed economic conditions, its relative importance on a principal's control system choice decreases (does not change) in an economic downturn (upturn). These findings are consistent with the notion that loss aversion dominates betrayal aversion in control system choices when decision makers are facing an economic downturn. This study suggests that the initial decision motivated by betrayal aversion cannot be assumed to be unaltered when the environment changes.","Betrayal aversion; Demand for accountability; Internal control; Loss aversion","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84863014292"

The current review attempts to gauge and map performance trends and intellectual knowledge structure of the financial distress research in the banking industry. A hybrid approach was adopted to inventorize, analyse and evaluate the financial distress literature pertaining to the banking industry (1982–2022); the authors apply bibliometric analysis to identify critical financial distress literature articles and journals, followed by the identification of central financial distress literature research themes through co-citation analysis. We found that financial distress researchers have published 11 papers each year since 1982, and the number of citations received by the research domain has significantly risen, adding more importance to this research domain. Further, the analysis helps delineate four thematic knowledge clusters throwing light on the nomological network of the field and giving a bird’s eye-view of the intellectual structure of the field.

We show that such shocks lead to severe economic downturns, lower inflation and persistent accommodating measures from monetary policy.

China is the world's largest WFP exporter. However, many factors, such as the downturn of traditional major export markets and the rise of the price of production factors, have generated great challenges and uncertainties for China's WFP export market. This study improves the product scope of WFPs. The category of WFPs has been expanded to 14 categories and 30 sub-categories, which is more detailed and more developed than in previous literature. Based on the United Nations' Comtrade Database (COMTRADE), this paper uses the revised constant market share (CMS) model to measure and analyze empirically the factors affecting the export growth of China's WFPs from the perspective of market, structure, and competitiveness. It is found that (1) the competitive effect exerts the biggest influence on export growth, followed by market size effects, with the effects of market distribution and product structure both being small; (2) wooden furniture, wooden products, plywood, paper, and its products play a main role in enhancing the competitive effect in China's WFPs; and (3) China's WFPs have a strong market competitiveness in other markets such as the USA, China Hong Kong, United Kingdom, Japan, Australia, Malaysia, and Singapore. Therefore, it is crucial for China's WFP market to improve its product structure effects and market distribution effects in order for it to participate in international competition. On the other hand, considering that China's exports of WFPs mainly consist of resource- and labor-intensive products, the improvement of standards such as the technology level, environmental protection and sustainable development, must not be ignored. © 2018 by the authors.","China; Export; Revised constant market share (CMS) model; Wood forest products","Australia; China; Hong Kong; Japan; Malaysia; Singapore [Southeast Asia]; United Kingdom; United States; competitiveness; database; decomposition; empirical analysis; environmental protection; export; forest product; international trade; market system; price dynamics; uncertainty analysis; wood","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85051115032"

The most significant incident driving change in the role of the corporate treasurer is the credit crisis that occurred in 2007-2009. The crisis replaced a focus on earnings with a focus on cash and liquidity, and marked the end of easy availability of cash for most corporates and the beginning of a situation in which the financial markets were no longer able to reliably supply corporate demand for financing. The crisis saw the end of a credit expansion initiated in the 1980s by the deregulation of the financial markets. Increased focus on liquidity and financial risk management changed the role of the treasurer dramatically. During the crisis, many sectors of the markets totally ceased to function, e.g. the ability to hedge foreign exchange and interest rate exposures was constrained for certain emerging markets and certain structured securities, such as Auction Rate Securities, became wholly illiquid. These disruptions led to an inability to hedge, manage liquidity or even properly measure certain risks any longer. Embedded risks - e.g., in vendor and customer contracts - also emerged as a critical focus and corporations were forced to take a broader view of risk in light of weaknesses and risks exposed by the crisis. As a result of these changes, treasury is no longer merely a function for cash management, funding and hedge accounting. Treasury is now a strategic function securing liquidity and understanding the true risk profile of the corporation. The treasurer is now much more involved in the management of the business and has become a business leader instead of an administrator. This transformation in role has placed a much higher demand on the skill sets of the treasurer and he or she must command the arts of communication and sales as any business area manager would. While the changing role of the treasurer resulted in new requirements, multinational companies maintained their focus on efficiency - particularly in response to the economic downturn. Yet executive managers and treasurers must not concentrate solely on cost savings, as this would fail to recognize and prioritize critical strategic benefits such as improved quality, resiliency and scope of work. As Treasury has become a strategic role, the legacy operational mandate has lessened in importance but Treasury must still determine the optimal organizational structure that meets both strategic goals and supports overall efficiency. In optimizing the organization of roles, treasurers and business leaders must also consider multicultural and other barriers - in many countries, ""custom and practice"" inhibit ""pure"" efficiencies that might be achieved via centralization or even regionalization. Further, an excessive focus on ""rationalization"" of functions can fail to attract and motivate key and highly qualified specialists required for critical knowledge centers, such as treasury departments. While a purely centralized model may, on the surface, appear optimal due to enhanced control and efficiency, competing factors that argue for local structures make it difficult for treasurers to determine the optimal balance between centralization, regionalization and locally sourced activities. Thus, treasurers must explicitly assess multinational organizational structures at the same time they face an expanding and more complex set of responsibilities. The ideas in our paper optimally apply to multinational companies operating in global environments that present challenges in language barriers and different time zones across the globe. While the paper has direct applicability for financial and treasury managers, the text also holds larger insights for any strategic manager at a complex, multinational organization. It addresses: · The change in the role of the treasurer resulting from the change in financial markets' functionality and the new restrictions in cash availability and risk hedging introduced during the credit crisis. This includes new strategies for cash and liquidity management. · The process of optimal centralization and segregation of operational duties across regional centers, a single global centre at the headquarters, and local units. We will show that centralization cannot be a theoretical construct, but must take into consideration regulation, local conventions and the identity and morale of the workforce. · Factors to consider when identifying optimal locations for regional centers. · The role of outsourcing in meeting emerging challenges while optimizing efficiency and organizational structure. While the challenges faced by the largest multinational corporations are complex, pressure on greater efficiency applies to mid-size companies too, and small to mid-size enterprises (e.g., those with less than 1 billion Euro annual turnover) may access additional competencies and improve efficiency by removing the process out of the company entirely. The article will help those companies evaluate what to outsource and how to choose a provider of outsourcing. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2011.","Assets and liabilities management; Cash management; Centralization of treasury; Corporate treasury management; Efficiency; Financial risk management; Standardization","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-81355135737"

It can also have practical relevance, as the global economic downturn that began in 2007 reminds us. For several decades, the economics establishment had been dismissive of Keynesianism, arguing that the world had moved beyond the ""depression economics"" with which it dealt. Keynesian economics, however, has now staged a comeback as governments attempt to formulate policy responses to the Great Recession of the first decade of the twenty-first century. Many of the issues that faced economists in the past are still with us. The theories and methods of such men as Adam Smith, T. R. Malthus, David Ricardo, J.S. Mill, Karl Marx, Alfred Marshall, and J. M. Keynes are often relevant to us today-and we can always learn from their mistakes. In his stimulating analysis Professor Barber assesses the thought of a number of important economists both in terms of the issues of their day and in relation to modern economic thought. By concentrating on the greatest exponents he highlights the central properties of the four main schools of economic thought - classical, Marxian, neo-classical, and Keynesian - and shows that although each of these traditions is rooted in a different stage of economic development, they can all provide insights into the recurring problems of modern economics. © William J.

However, the restrictive economic policies did not grant growth: Brazil grew a little bit more than 1.0% on average over 2017–2019. It was this stagnated Brazil that the Covid-19 pandemic met, turning it worse than what had already been bad.

Comparing average energy efficiencies across countries among three time periods, 1990 to 1998, 1999 to 2007, and 2008 to 2015, we find the following trends: (1) countries with highest energy efficiency cluster geographically suggesting spillover effects; (2) from the first period to the second period, 67.44% of European countries’ average energy efficiency increased, while only 59.09% of European countries’ average energy efficiencies increased between the first and the third period; (3) gains in energy efficiency may be levelling off or decreasing over time; and (4) when countries face economic downturn, they experience a decrease in energy efficiency signalling possible future decreases in energy efficiency in light of the recent recessions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. Finally, we compute potential energy savings from a counterfactual experiment in which countries realize full efficiency.

Spillovers of fiscal consolidations on growth are found to be initially larger between countries belonging to currency unions, though this larger impact vanishes over the medium term. Larger spillovers of fiscal consolidation coincide with lower bilateral exports, higher bilateral imports and relative increases in unit labour costs in currency unions.

This situation has led to a call by the International Monetary Fund for more flexible exchange rate adjustment and even currency devaluation to reverse the economic downturn. This call for devaluation has generated controversy among economists and policymakers in these countries and has revived the need to study the effects of devaluation on economic output in SSA countries. This study therefore examines the asymmetric effects of currency devaluation as a policy shift on economic output between 1980 and 2019 in six selected SSA countries, namely Ghana, Kenya, Tanzania, Mozambique, Nigeria, and Malawi. The study employs the smooth transition regression (STR) model to determine the relative asymmetric responses of economic output to devaluation and nondevaluation regimes. The results of STR are mixed, as devaluation asymmetrically impacts positively and significantly on economic output in Ghana, Kenya, Tanzania, and Mozambique, but is insignificant in the case of Nigeria and Malawi. This mixed result suggests that the impact of currency devaluation on economic output differs across countries depending on the structure and size of the economy, the nature of goods produced, and the supportive policies in place, among other things. The policy implication of the findings is that policymakers in various countries should understand the peculiarity of core macroeconomic variables in order to design and implement robust policies. © 2021","Africa; asymmetric effects; currency devaluation; economic output","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85120938228"

It discusses what ‘fair’ could mean in this context, summarises some key policy revisions since 1944 in this light, and reminds readers of the damage caused by unfairness within education. Most notably it discusses the almost complete introduction of comprehensive schools by the 1970s, and the subsequent proliferation of new school types. The article then presents the methods used for the illustrations from secondary data that follow. Based on the Annual Schools Census 1989 to 2014, the article shows that the clustering of disadvantaged students using all available indicators has declined over historical time. This may be largely determined by an increase in prevalence created by immigration, sensitivity and improved diagnosis, and economic downturn. However, the system shows considerable variation between regions and areas linked to the local diversity of schools. Selective, faith-based, converter academies and free schools, as opposed to local authority comprehensives, are disproportionately in areas with the greatest segregation of disadvantaged students. And this occurs for no gain in improvement.

Yet some firms were better prepared to weather the downturn than others. Using a unique micro dataset of shareholding companies from emerging countries in Eastern and Southern Europe derived from the World Bank's Enterprise Surveys, we econometrically test the hypothesis that pre-crisis innovation affected their survival odds and performance thereafter. Overall, the results indicate that the innovation-survival connection holds. Nevertheless, firms that have been identified as innovating excessively before the crisis turned out to be far more likely to die, whereas cautious innovators came out better off. Firms that stretched their resources too much, that were too bold, faced dire consequences. If appetite for risky innovation is sociably desirable and the crisis weeds out viable businesses, including those that may drive the recovery, there is a role for public policy to mitigate the short-lived selection inefficiencies that proliferate during severe recessions.

We find, in general, recovery from a GDP recession in the Asian economies is somewhat slower than in the OECD economies. However, recovery from a financial downturn is not much different between Asia and the OECD. We also find the OECD economies have been more active and effective in using counter-cyclical policies than the Asian economies in the face of GDP recessions and financial downturns.

This downward pressure is mainly (although not exclusively) important to the large category of packaged consumer goods. The two causes of this downward pressure are, first, a gradual change in the balance of power between the manufacturing sector and the retail trade, because of the growth in the strength of the latter. The second cause is connected with the behaviour of large advertisers. They are increasingly learning how to benefit from the scale economies accruing to their brands by reducing advertising expenditures on them. They are also the types of advertisers accustomed to carrying out econometric investigations, which always demonstrate the eventual onset of diminishing returns to incremental advertising pressure: something which obviously inhibits increases in advertising budgets. There is no reason to suppose that these causes of downward pressure will become less important in the future. The result will be a dampening of the positive effect of economic revival on advertising expenditure, and an added impetus to the negative effect on advertising of an economic downturn. These prognoses do not offer optimism to media proprietors or to advertising agencies which work on the commission system. The forward thrust in these businesses has in recent years been confined to television; and the emergence of cable competition may weaken this in the future. However, the ability of advertisers to support their brands with reduced advertising expenditures as long as their competitors do the same offers increasingly attractive opportunities for them to reduce their operating costs and thus to withstand better the pressure from retailers, which has led in the past to a syphoning of margins from manufacturers to retailers. Insofar as a proportion of these margins is passed to the consumer in the form of lower prices (a move forced by the pace of retail competition), this is a movement which is very strongly in the public interest. © 1985, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

In particular, we investigated whether these pathways were different between lower and higher socioeconomic status (SES) groups. Background: Due to the global economic downturn brought on by COVID-19, many couples experienced economic hardship including increased household debt, job loss, and reduced work hours. This context provides a valuable opportunity to test the family stress model (FSM) of romantic relationships, which explains the indirect pathways from economic hardship to couple-level outcomes. Method: We collected the data using an online survey in May 2020, when the Seoul metropolitan area experienced the first surge of COVID-19 cases. The sample came from 605 married Korean adults (282 women, 323 men) and was analyzed using multigroup path analysis. Results: Among the three markers of economic hardship, increased household debt had a stronger association with couple conflict for lower SES respondents directly and indirectly through elevated economic strain and emotional distress. The total effects of job loss and reduced work hours on more frequent couple conflict were stronger for the higher SES group. Conclusion: The process from the three markers of economic hardship to couple conflict was different depending on socioeconomic resources. Implications: Family practitioners need to consider SES variations and to work with financial counselors to better support couples with both economic and relationship difficulties. © 2022 The Authors.

Economic downturns could either lead to a sober mood and drive the interest in serious genres or drive the need for distraction leading to an increased interest in feel-good or action movies. However, characteristics of the movie industry suggest that economic key factors have only limited effects on supply and demand. A time series analysis of supply and demand in three major European markets indicate that demand is unrelated to the state of the economy. In aggregate, the demand does not instruct supply. Fluctuations in individual movie quality superpose potential effects of the economic context on the aggregated demand.

In line with this trend in housing research, this paper seeks to explain the development of housing systems in Taiwan and to show how the high percentage of home ownership is related to the different routes by which new homeowners gain access to the sector. With the growing influence of market-based housing provision, home ownership depends more on the deepening involvement of the financial system, especially at the lower end of the market. Along with the changes in the wider social context - such as the downturn of the housing market, the wider economic recession, the rising rate of unemployment - the housing system that is dominated by mortgaged home ownership is in crisis.","Home ownership; Housing market; Housing mortgage; Housing policy; Housing provision in Taiwan","Taiwan; homeowner; housing market; housing policy; housing provision","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0036239784"

In this study, we analyze how the risk of predation evolves in different political regimes. Formally, we look at the interaction between a government and citizens in which, in each period, the government has an option to predate. Citizens prefer governments that are competent and non-predatory and strive to replace ones that are not. Regimes differ in the degree to which citizens can succeed in doing so. In pure democracies, citizens can displace incumbent governments; in pure autocracies, they cannot; and in intermediate cases, they can do so in probability. After economic downturns, the posterior probability that the government is competent and benevolent declines. According to the model, in intermediate regimes, but not in others, governments can separate by type. One implication, then, is that these regimes are politically and economically more volatile, with higher levels of variation in assessments of political risk and in economic performance. Another is that in such regimes, political leadership can make an economic difference. Empirically, we test our argument by measuring the impact of economic downturns on the perceived risk of political expropriation in different regime types, using as instruments the incidence of natural disasters and unexpected terms of trade shocks. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","","democracy; economics; politics; risk factor","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84862600759"

Generally, high-ability managers are most beneficial to manufacturing firms during oil shocks. In the event of oil supply shocks that are associated with negative economic implications, talented managers strongly outperform in (i) energy, (ii) agriculture, forestry, & fishing, and (iii) services industries. However, during oil demand consumption shocks that are symbolic of economic growth, competent managers underperform in the (a) energy, (b) mining, (c) construction, (d) retail, and (e) services sectors. Notably, high-ability managers in energy firms are associated with significant outperformance and underperformance during oil supply and consumption shocks, respectively. It is probable that these adept managers employ more active hedging programs to reduce financial distress or minimize earnings volatility to safeguard against oil price downturns. Similarly, in other industries, it is plausible that skillful managers may actively engage in oil price risk management (e.g., reducing reliance, alternatives, hedging, etc.). During supply shocks, the associated benefits outweigh the costs, and vice versa during oil consumption demand shocks. © 2023 The Authors","Firm performance; Inflation; Managerial ability; Oil price; Oil shocks","Energy resources; Industrial economics; Energy; Firm Performance; Inflation; Innovative method; Managerial ability; Managerial performance; Oil consumption; Oil price shocks; Oil Prices; Oil shock; economic growth; industrial performance; inflation; oil supply; price dynamics; Risk management","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85166091513"

From our literature search, the suggested approach is one of the first to adopt a hybrid payment method in light of the post-Covid-19 pandemic. The hybrid payment strategy with advanced and delayed payments was proposed to enhance business activities.

Literature suggests that bilateral trade linkages lead to the diffusion of “good” labor standards from importing countries of the Global North to exporting countries of the Global South. The crucial mechanism is the ability and willingness of importing firms to deploy their market leverage and ask for improved labor standards from their overseas suppliers. Yet, cost-cutting pressures emanating from economic downturns might lead the same importing firms to give lower priority to worker safety in their overseas supply chains. When importing firms demand price reductions, overseas suppliers might respond by reducing wages, ignoring safety regulations, and working their labor force for longer hours. The observable implication is that worker safety in the Global South may deteriorate during economic downturns in their export markets located in the Global North. We evaluate our hypothesis using a panel of 83 developing countries for the period during 1980–2009, and find that economic downturns in developed country markets are associated with significant increases in non-fatal occupational injury rates in developing countries. The injury-increasing effect is more pronounced in developing countries with weak workers’ rights protection. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","bilateral trade; economic cycle; economic downturns; standards diffusion; worker safety","developing world; economic cycle; export; health impact; import; international trade; labor standard; occupational exposure; safety; working conditions","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85018672501"

To stay ahead in this more competitive environment, firms are being forced to constantly reevaluate their current strategy. Often this entails a reexamination of existing cost structures and the exploration of efficiency enhancing options. In this context, it should come as no surprise that employee downsizing has become an integral part of organizational life in corporate America. While downsizing is not a new phenomenon, it was only during the major economic downturn in the early 1980s that we started to see high levels of employee reductions for reasons other than job performance. Prior to that, such reductions were often temporary, with employees laid off during downturns being recalled when business conditions improved. More recently, firms have often engaged in employee downsizing of a more permanent nature. Radical restructurings undertaken in response to increased, often foreign, competition and the desire on the part of firms to drastically reduce payroll costs have often meant plant closures and permanent layoffs. Indeed, employee downsizing has emerged as an important weapon in the arsenal of many managers seeking enhanced efficiency and improved firm performance. As Datta, Guthrie, Basuil, and Pandey (2010, p. 282) suggest, “given its magnitude and impact, employee downsizing can legitimately be viewed as one of the most far reaching and significant management issues of the current era.” Very importantly, what used to be a primarily US practice has now become a global phenomenon with large-scale layoffs becoming commonplace in European and Asian corporations. © Cambridge University Press 2012.","","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84907179704"

Given the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the possible economic downturn after the pandemic, staycation becomes important to individual wellbeing and the tourism industry’s sustainable development in the post-COVID era. In this study, we applied protection motivation theory and stimulus-organism-response (SOR) framework to develop and empirically test a theoretical model examining the relationships between protection motivation/travel anxiety and staycation intention in the COVID-19 context. A cross-country survey design was applied to collect data from Australia and China. PLS-SEM analyses revealed that perceived pandemic severity, pandemic response efficacy, and pandemic self-efficacy significantly predicted protection motivation across the two country samples; perceived pandemic severity and perceived pandemic susceptibility positively contributed to travel anxiety. For Australian respondents, travel anxiety predicted staycation intention, whilst for Chinese respondents, protection motivation predicted staycation intention. Post-hoc moderation analysis identified that collectivism (individualism), as a cultural value orientation, moderated the effect of travel anxiety on staycation intention among Australian respondents. This study contributes to the understanding of staycation intention from a protection motivation perspective and enriches the emerging literature on staycation in the field of tourism. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Australia; China; COVID-19; protection motivation; Staycation; travel anxiety","Australia; China; financial crisis; perception; questionnaire survey; survey design; sustainable development; tourism development","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85164605984"

Design/methodology/approach: The paper hypothesises that workplaces subject to technological change have an increased demand for skills, which induces an increased provision of training. UK data from two waves (1998 and 2004) of the Workplace Employment Relations Survey (WERS) are used to investigate this hypothesis. Findings: Workplaces undertaking technological change are more likely to train their workers and also to provide more days of training per worker. Team working is also associated with a greater number of days spent on training, as are the setting of training targets and the keeping of training records. Training intensity decreases with an increasing share of part-time and manual employees. Conversely, where workplaces face difficulties in filling skilled vacancies, they provide more days of training. Research limitations/implications: The WERS training questions refer only to core experienced employees which, since this group may vary from one workplace to another, may not give a completely consistent measure of either absolute or relative training provision. Because the WERS panel (1998 and 2004) excludes both the dependent variable (training intensity) and the variable of interest (technical change), the analysis is restricted to cross-section estimation. Causal implications of this analysis should be regarded as correspondingly tentative. Practical implications: The findings suggest that one way to induce firms to provide more training is by enhanced incentives for firms to undertake more rapid technological change. In addition, if the current global economic downturn persists, evidence that operating in a declining market is associated with the provision of fewer training days may be of particular concern to training professionals and policy makers. Originality/value: The paper provides empirical evidence concerning the interaction between technological change and training. © 2010 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Change management; Skills; Training; United Kingdom; Workplace","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-77955613404"

Governments around the world provide considerable financial support to mitigate the economic downturn. However, effective policy responses require reliable data on the economic consequences of the corona pandemic. We propose the CoRisk-Index: a real-time economic indicator of corporate risk perceptions related to Covid-19. Using data mining, we analyse all reports from US companies filed since January 2020, representing more than a third of the US workforce. We construct two measures—the number of ‘corona’ words in each report and the average text negativity of the sentences mentioning corona in each industry—that are aggregated in the CoRisk-Index. The index correlates with U.S. unemployment rates across industries and with an established market volatility measure, and it preempts stock market losses of February 2020. Moreover, thanks to topic modelling and natural language processing techniques, the CoRisk data provides highly granular data on different dimensions of the crisis and the concerns of individual industries. The index presented here helps researchers and decision makers to measure risk perceptions of industries with regard to Covid-19, bridging the quantification gap between highly volatile stock market dynamics and long-term macroeconomic figures.

Previous cycles suggest that the fate of workers within the hegemonic core depends in part on their political and organizational response. For a generation, organized labor in the United States has sought ways to exercise influence over private and public pension funds. As a result, union staffers have become sophisticated shareholder activists. Recent financial scandals have created a new opening for these activists, who have responded by forming coalitions to reform executive pay. The recent dismissal of a California Personnel Employees Retirement System official implies limits to this investor ""pluralism,"" but the situation is hardly settled.

A significant similarity is that the economic downturn is having a lower impact on spending than was predicted.

This study employed the quantile structural breaks tests to identify possible structural changes in various suicide rates under the framework of the repeat cross-sectional quantile regression model in the US over the period from January 1999 to December 2013 for the first time. Together with the QAR-based unit root test, we found that positive shocks have significant impacts on various suicide rates, and the persistence of suicide was confirmed for all suicide rates in some pre-specified quantiles except for the suicide rate of the middle age (aged 35–54) group. Specifically, the persistence of suicide was identified in the lower quantiles for the overall suicide rate and the suicide rate of the middle-old age (aged 55–64) group. There exists persistence of suicide in the two tails of quantiles for the suicide rates of the young (aged 15–34) and the elderly (aged 65 and older) groups. The surveillance system established for suicide prevention should target the middle-old age (aged 55–64) group during economic downturn periods and target the young (aged 15–34) and the elderly (aged 65 or older) groups during periods from economic downturns to recessions. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Persistence; Quantile structural change; Quantile unit root; Suicide","United States; economic theory; macroeconomics; numerical model; regression analysis; suicide; unit root test","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84995459569"

This research joins endeavour to discover drivers of SMEs' profitability and growth. Having more than 3,500 respondents and applying ordinary least square, we find that SMEs manage optimal working capital to improve profitability and growth. SMEs that involve in foreign trading enjoy higher profitability. Banks' loan drives SMEs profitability and sales higher, but collateral limits the growth. The results indicate that female causes better sales, but not profitability. Owners involvement in the business does not affect growth but adds profitability. Surprisingly, experience drives the growth and profitability down. Being in a capital city hurts SMEs' growth, but does not affect profitability. The SMEs sub-sectors influence growth and profitability. Among macro-economic variables, only Bank Indonesia's rates affect SMEs' profit. The results hint where SMEs could invent strategies fit their goals better, and suggest banks or government agencies revise their policies to match the real needs of SMEs.","Drivers; Growth; Non-financial; Profitability; Sales; SMEs","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85019000177"

Yet we know precious little about the true genesis of these investigations. This paper uses the vector-autoregression methodology to examine the dynamic interrelationships between the various criminal and civil antitrust enforcement variables. A key result is that the number of criminal prosecutions increases in the years immediately following an increase in the number of civil cases, suggesting that merger reviews and other civil investigations may alert the antitrust authorities to criminal antitrust activities. To the best of my knowledge, this is the first econometric analysis that demonstrates the quantitative size of this effect and the time lags in the relationship. Other findings include important dynamic interrelationships between grand jury investigations, the number of individuals and corporations prosecuted, and criminal cases, indicating that information unearthed during a given criminal investigation and prosecution often reveals information about other conspiracies leading to future investigations and prosecutions. Finally, the number of criminal cases prosecuted increases following an economic downturn. We relate this increase to the literature, which points to cartel instability during economic downturns. © The Author (2007). Published by Oxford University Press.

In the event the economy is not fully insulated by exchange rate depreciation, it shows that, in principle, monetary policy is a superior instrument to fiscal stimulus for restoring aggregate demand to the full employment level. Since monetary policy is not handicapped by numerous problems that render fiscal stimulus less effective, it should normally be considered a sufficient instrument on its own. © 2010 The Economic Society of Australia","exchange rate; F31; F33; F41; fiscal stimulus; global financial crises; monetary policy; national income","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85016251304"

We find that China’s overall pay inequality started to rise rapidly in the early 1990s and that it peaked in 2008, with the between-province component peaking as early as 2002. Since 2008, overall pay inequality has decreased, with between-province and between-sector inequality both showing steady declines. We argue that China’s pay inequality during the reform period was not simply a matter of economic inequality; it was the joint product of both market and institutional forces. In this vein, we also argue that the recent decline of overall pay inequality after the 2008 global economic crisis was not a temporary phenomenon triggered by the global downturn, but a long-term outcome driven by both economic and policy factors. © 2016, GIGA German Institute of Global and Area Studies.

The financial crisis of the 2000S affected more regions of the world but its effects on particular countries were more heterogeneous, varying according to countries' dependence on different sources of foreign exchange. The worst affected regions were South and Eastern Europe and Latin America. Because of heavy aid dependence and less integration with financial markets, sub- Saharan Africa was less badly affected, while in the 1980s sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America suffered most. In aggregate terms, the fall in gross domestic product (GDP) was much greater in the 2000s than the 1980s. Yet, taken as a whole, the impact on poverty appears to have been less. One major difference between the 1980s and 2000s was the greater autonomy countries had in policy-making, and lesser dependence on the International Monetary Fund, allowing countries to follow more expansionary policies. Government expenditure as a proportion of GDP was generally sustained in 2000s in contrast to severe cuts in the 1980s. Moreover, there were more extensive social support programmes in existence in the 2000s that acted as mild protections against economic downturn. Like the 1980s, there were no real-time data for poverty in 2008 and 2009 at a global level. Global estimates based on simulations show a slowdown in poverty reduction and no increase in actual poverty rates, yet the limited 'actual' data reviewed here show an increase in the rate of income poverty, some with social protection programmes in many places, although mostly the increase was more modest than the 1980s. The crisis of 2000s was shorter than the 1980s, so that people and governments could draw on their savings to protect their livelihoods, but if the global recession recurs, the poverty consequences could become much worse. The need for short-term indicators of poverty remains urgent, if we are to be able to analyse the effects of crises on poverty (natural disasters and conflict as well as economic fluctuations) rapidly and accurately, and to design appropriate protective policies. © 2012 Human Development and Capability Association.","Adjustment; Financial crisis; Poverty","","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84868106281"

The empirical results confirm that demand shocks in the form of changes in government spending and in the terms of trade were important in both downturn and recovery.

The study used ARDL cointegration approach to investigate the relationship between these variables. The study found that there is long run equilibrium relationship among the variables in two sample periods. The results show that an increase in government debt or government expenditure will decrease household consumption per capita. This implies that the Ricardian Equivalence does hold for Lesotho. The results also imply that fiscal policy is an ineffective tool to stabilize the economy.

Indeed, a recent report by Deloitte (2012) shows that a growing number of mining companies are postponing large projects due to rising costs and uncertainty about the future. Yet, despite these near-term restrictions, some mining companies and government bodies are increasing their investments, albeit more cautiously. For example, a recent report by the Minerals Council of Australia (2012) states that: “The fundamental drivers of minerals demand growth, urbanization and industrialization, will exist for the next 20 years or more. Neither weaknesses in developed world economies nor a temporary deceleration in China will dampen these long-term trends.” Compared to other sectors, then, it seems that the mining industry still offers relatively more expansive opportunities for employment and professional development than other industries. Given the global expansion of the mining industry (Deloitte, 2012), the careers of mining professionals are characterized by increasingly high levels of international mobility (Mayes and Pini, 2012; Peetz and Murray, 2010). The nature of that mobility can be diverse, involving relocation to and from geographically remote locations, where the work environment and the work itself may be physically and mentally demanding oftentimes requiring management of and adjustment to the cross-cultural complexities that such moves may involve. © Kate Hutchings and Snejina Michailova 2014.","","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84943369833"

Job transitions, layoffs, and family disruptions result in periods of low income and vulnerability to food insecurity. Economic and food assistance programs have helped protect many U.S. households when the market economy has failed to do so. These programs have reduced vulnerability to falling income and food insecurity during economic downturns in the business cycle. However effective food assistance programs have been for reducing short-term vulnerability, they do not enhance a household's ability to achieve sustainable food security.

The study is based on the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) data collected during the pandemic. It comprised 51,778 people in twenty-seven European countries and Israel. Participants were asked about changes in their health status relative to pre-pandemic. Bivariate analysis and logistic regression were used to identify factors associated with worsening of health. Nine percent of people (average age 70 years) reported a worsening of health relative to pre-pandemic. A logistic regression revealed a significant relation of the probability of a downturn in health to forgoing, postponing, or being denied an appointment for medical care. Multiple chronic illnesses, developing COVID-19, having at least one form of psychosocial distress, higher age, and lower economic capacity were also found significantly related to the probability of a decline in health. Older adults’ comprehensive health needs must be addressed even when healthcare services are under strain due to pandemic outbreaks. Policymakers should attend to the healthcare needs of people whose vulnerability to the pandemic is amplified by chronic health conditions and low socioeconomic status.

In some cases these cuts have been accompanied by calls to expand private financing to improve the efficiency of health systems. In low and middle-income countries seeking to increase access to health care, it is sometimes suggested that private financing is more effective than public financing because of weak state institutions and bureaucratic shortcomings. In this paper, we review the theoretical and empirical evidence on private financing in terms of cost, efficiency, equity and financial protection. We consider private health insurance, medical savings accounts and user charges in high, middle and low-income countries. The theoretical and empirical evidence reveals major market failures in the health sector. It is unlikely that private financing generates better results than public financing. Still, as private financing options are heterogeneous, it is possible that a particular form might play a beneficial role in a specific setting. Given the current state of knowledge, however, any calls to increase private financing must be accompanied by robust evidence, such as real world pilot studies. © 2016 University of Durham and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84961276015"

Product specialization and export markets would contribute to efficiency enhancement in the short run. Also, garment firms located in Ho Chi Minh City, where competition is fiercer than other production areas, tend to achieve higher efficiency performance. To a lesser extent, private ownership and smaller firm size (small and medium-sized enterprise - SME) appear to be associated with higher efficiency.

During the Great Recession, France experienced a significant rise in both female and male unemployment. Germany apparently witnessed a gendered ""employment miracle"" and is thus cited as a model, especially for its structural labour market reforms, often presented as the reason for its current employment performance. In both countries, economic downturns have hit male-dominated sectors and men's employment first, thereby leading to a reduction or a reversal of the unemployment gender gap and challenging the male (main) breadwinner model. If women did not withdraw from the labour market, they have not been spared economic hardship: their employment and social conditions were hit in the second stages of recessions and impaired by austerity measures and structural reforms, especially in Germany. While recovery plans and labour market policies have provided support for male-dominated sectors, structural labour market reforms and activation policies have deteriorated the quality of women's employment. © OFCE.

Fiscal multipliers are found to be significant in the Euro Area so that fiscal cuts had strong and permanent Keynesian effects, rather than a transitive and minor downturn as initially assumed. In light of this, the paper argues that policies should now concentrate on enhancing growth and by relaxing fiscal targets allow the multipliers to raise activity as the only route to safeguard the exit from recession and ensure sustainability of debt. © 2013 National Institute of Economic and Social Research.","Debt; fiscal policy; Greece; H60; H61","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84876946383"

The social media landscape has further complicated the customer connections with retail brands, creating serious challenges for retailers. Marketers are baffled by the constant urgent call by practitioners regarding the social media trend among customers, and they are finding it difficult to determine whether the social media effects can have a long term impact on both the customer perception of a brand and on the long-term trends in brand value. Quantifying the influence of social media in the long-run is essential for the development of branding and marketing strategies that lead to sustained competitive advantage. Empirical assessment includes vector autoregressive econometric modelling to determine whether a brand's value is stable or trending over time and quantify the persistent effect of social media factors using the real-world data available on social media.

This article reviews and assesses theories and empirical findings on the impact of institutions on national wealth and inequality. It focuses on macro-comparative research on affluent countries. National wealth is typically measured as gross domestic product per capita. Prior to the 1970s, thinking about the determinants of national wealth was dominated by the approach used by mainstream economists. That approach focuses on capital, labour, and technology, and it assumes that poorer countries catch up with richer ones via factor equalization. In the 1950s and 1960s, patterns among the world's richest countries seemed to more or less conform to this expectation. But in the 1970s, a number of these countries experienced sharp economic downturns. © Oxford University Press, 2010.

Yet the trade decisions have not been the subject of much anxiety or debate. At the same time, their second largest contributors to foreign exchange earnings (hucksters) are seldom the subject of public discussion. I suggest in this article that these omissions have to do with the manner in which flexibility is culturally conceptualized. Rather than a recent adaptation to the physiopsychological disciplining of a post-Fordian or ""globalized"" economy, I argue that in Dominica, flexibility is historically constituted through a much longer engagement with capitalism in the formation of the Caribbean as a cultural area over the last five centuries. The entrepreneurial savvy found among hucksters is autochthonous to Dominica's trade culture.","","Atlantic islands; Atlantic Ocean; Caribbean Islands; Dominica; Leeward Islands [Lesser Antilles]; Lesser Antilles; Fordia; capitalism; cultural tradition; entrepreneur; exchange rate; export; national identity; World Trade Organization","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-34347256346"

High unemployment has relatively limited effect in pulling inflation down while low unemployment can be much more effective in driving it up. Economic downturns are both more rapid and sustained in driving unemployment up than recoveries are in bringing it down. There is considerable variety in these relationships and IS curves across countries, sectors and regions. Monetary policy reacts more vigorously outside a central corridor. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Design/methodology/approach: A stratified random sample of adult consumers in the southeastern USA were surveyed by telephone. The hypotheses were tested utilizing structural equation modeling. Findings: The results indicated that those consumers with a lower level of perceived economic welfare (i.e. see the economy and their family's financial situation as worse this year versus last year) were less motivated to consume for status. Furthermore, this relationship was positively moderated by education. No relationship was found between consumer confidence (i.e. consumers' perceptions of the economy in the future year) and status consumption. The results suggest that those consumers who perceive themselves to be financially better off this year versus last, particularly those more educated, are more motivated to consume for status. Research limitations/implications: The main research limitation was that the sample skewed to be older, female and Caucasian, though the sample did match Census figures for the critical variable of education. Additionally, the phone response rate was 9 percent, but it is important to recognize that this was for a non-student sample. Practical implications: The results suggest that marketers, targeting luxury consumers in the current stagnant economy, aim for more educated consumers who see their economic welfare as improving. This implication stems from the research findings revealing that consumers who feel they are recovering economically from the recent economic downturn, especially those with higher education levels, may more likely be status consumers. Originality/value: With the democratization of luxury there is renewed interest in luxury consumption research. While research suggests there is a relationship between economic conditions and status consumption, few studies have measured consumer economic perceptions in relation to status consumption and none have examined how education may play a moderating role in explaining why people buy luxuries in a tough economic climate. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Consumer confidence; Consumer welfare; Economic perceptions; Status consumption","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84899660544"

Therefore, the aim of this investigation is to ascertain the level to which CSH has been implemented and the barriers preventing this. A questionnaire survey was sent to 71 of the Home Builders Federation (HBF) member organisations in the UK, to gauge and ascertain the following: the barriers to the implementation of CSH; the implications of implementation; and the general awareness of CSH amongst practitioners. The results from the analysis of the survey reveal that full implementation by 2016 appears a rather difficult target, as factors like economic downturn are hitting HBF and similar organisations quite hard. However, a government-driven injection of sustainable schemes is helping to bring back confidence to house builders, while also enhancing the way that barriers are handled within the industry. The key findings of the literature review identify barriers preventing the housing sector from achieving zero carbon homes by 2016. These include cost, and legislative, cultural and technical barriers, and are concordant with the results from the data obtained during the primary research. The analysis suggests that with the current trend, achieving full implementation will be difficult. However, comments made by some practitioners appear to suggest that the appointment of a CSH champion for implementation would accelerate the process of full implementation and that the target could be reached by 2016. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Homes; Policy; Sustainability; Zero carbon","United Kingdom; adoption constraint; building; carbon; government; housing policy; implementation process; literature review; questionnaire survey; sustainability; sustainable development","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84961122632"

The United States' rise to sole superpower status has given Washington a dominant role in all four dimensions of world affairs: political, strategic, economic, and technological/cultural. Meanwhile, China has achieved a spectacular economic performance for the past two decades, sustaining high growth rates, and escaping, so far, the Asian economic crisis of 1997-98. This expansion has greatly increased China's influence in regional and global affairs. The 'two downs' refer to the downturns of Russia and Japan.

Previous research casts doubt on this possibility and suggests that economic change exerts a minimal influence on welfare attitudes. Yet most of this research focuses on aggregate preferences, which potentially obscures important changes taking place at the level of social class. This study uses cross-national and temporal variation in unemployment rates as an empirical point of leverage to examine how unemployment rates influence class conflict over tax attitudes. The analysis combines individual-level data on tax attitudes (from different modules of the International Social Survey Programme) with country-level data on unemployment rates (from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) to create a dataset with information on both individuals' tax attitudes and larger unemployment rates. Findings from two-way fixedeffects logistic regression models indicate that rising unemployment induces classbased change in tax attitudes. High-level professionals and managers respond to rising unemployment by withdrawing support for raising tax progressivity. By contrast, manual workers (along with low-level professionals and managers) respond to rising unemployment by increasing their support for tax progressivity. The results are observed across two different data sources. The study suggests that economic changes can foster class polarization in political attitudes.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85020202119"

Design/methodology/approach: This study used autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) with intervention analysis to examine Iowa statewide aggregated monthly slot coin-in, table drop, and admission from December 2001 through June 2012. Findings: The results of analyses show that: slot coin-in was not affected by the recession; table drop was slightly affected, but started to recover in late 2010; and monthly admission was not affected by the recession, and showed a significant increase after the recession. The results also indicate that the decrease in table drop in Iowa casinos represented only a very small amount of state gaming revenue in 2008. Therefore, the findings of this study suggest that Iowa's gaming volume was not significantly affected by the recent recession. In other words, Iowa's gaming industry is still recession-proof. Practical implications: Current economic conditions suggest that the threat of a double-dip recession is quite real. The findings of this study are expected to help casino managers in Iowa understand how non-destination casinos behaved differently through the recession and strategically plan for a possible future economic downturn. In fact, the significant increase of monthly admission during the last recession implies that the Iowa gaming industry has actually benefited from the recession by accommodating more patrons. Therefore, to capitalize on the next recession, Iowa's casino operators should consider reducing the number of table games and increasing the number of slot machines to accommodate more slot players and reduce operating costs. Originality/value: Most existing gaming-related research focuses on gaming destinations such as Las Vegas and Atlantic City. No known study on gaming volume in non-destination gaming markets has been identified. By examining Iowa's gaming volume through the recession, this study provides initial empirical evidence of the impact of recession on non-destination gaming markets. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Admissions; ARIMA; Betting; Coin-in; Gaming volume; Intervention analysis; Iowa gaming; Recession proof; Table drops; Time series; Time series analysis; United States of America","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84884507656"

However, recent events in 2009 showed us even giant firms listed among the top R&D spenders can suffer serious consequences caused by economic downturn. This paper investigates significance of R&D efforts over business growth overtime based on the data gathered from companies listed as top R&D spenders between years 2001 and 2006. Annual R&D expenditure and annual R&D expenditure per employee metrics have been used as indicators of R&D efforts where as annual sales revenue data has been used for measuring business growth. Implications of this study provide insights about the relationship between building and exploiting technological capabilities. For instance, findings show that business growth is not a function of an individual organisation's R&D investments only, but a function of its relative amount of investments compared to its competitors. It has also been observed that relationship between R&D efforts and business growth in different industries cannot be generalised due to each one having unique dynamics.

Also, we proposed a method for shedding light on that question by using a small macroeconometric model in a quadratic linear tracking stochastic control framework with an implicit feedback rule to compare a scenario in which fiscal policy was changed quarterly to a scenario in which it was only changed once a year. In this paper we first report on the use of counterfactual experiments in the 2007–2010 period of a major downturn in the economy. We find in one experiment that quarterly changes in policy stabilize output levels in the economy better than annual changes with a slightly larger increase in debt over the counterfactual period. In a second experiment we find that when weight changes are used to get roughly equal stabilization results, the increase in the debt level over the counterfactual periods is substantially less with quarterly than with annual policy changes. In the second part of the paper we repeat the two experiments but do so in a Monte Carlo framework. The results in this more general framework also point the way to a finding that a relatively simple shift from annual to quarterly fiscal policy could provide either better stabilization results with a slightly larger increase in the debt level or similar stabilization results but with a smaller increase in the debt level. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Economic stochastic control models; Feedback rules; Fiscal policy; Macroeconomics; Stabilization policy; Stochastic control","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84879572345"

We demonstrate how the loss given default model with the default and recovery dependent via the latent systematic risk factor can be estimated using Bayesian inference methodology and the Markov chain Monte Carlo method. This approach is very convenient for joint estimation of all model parameters and latent systematic factors. Moreover, all relevant uncertainties are easily quantified. Typically available data is the annual averages of defaults and recoveries and thus the data sets are small and parameter uncertainty is significant. In this case, the Bayesian approach is superior to the maximum likelihood method, which relies on a large-sample limit Gaussian approximation for the parameter uncertainty. As an example, we consider a homogeneous portfolio with one latent factor. However, the approach can be easily extended to deal with nonhomogenous portfolios and several latent factors. © 2013, Journal of Credit Risk.

Remittances have become a major source of revenue, surpassing the volume of foreign direct investment (FDI) and official development assistance (ODA) that the country receives. This study focuses primarily on the stability, cyclicality and stabilization impacts of remittances to Pakistan. It is evident that foreign flows exhibit different types of volatility; remittances are found to be a less volatile source of external finance than FDI and ODA; they are also found to be counter-cyclical and stabilizing, thus serving to stabilize the recipient economy in times of economic downturns. ODA appears to be a-cyclical and stabilizing, whereas FDI emerges as pro-cyclical and destabilizing. Furthermore, remittances are insensitive to cyclical fluctuations in the sending countries. We also consider a structural vector autoregressive (SVAR)-based identification in order to examine the responses of financial flows to innovation in receiving and sending economies. We confirm the counter-cyclical mechanism of remittances with respect to Pakistani output. In particular, our results indicate that remittance flows to Pakistan are mainly explained by the economic conditions in the country. © 2016, © 2016 SAGE Publications India Private Limited.","business cycle; FDI; ODA; Pakistan; Remittances","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84962688937"

The liquidity improvement associated with dividend payments translates into an economically meaningful reduction in the cost of equity capital. Our results are robust to endogeneity concerns, to alternative measures of liquidity risk and dividend payouts, and to alternative model specifications. Further analysis suggests that the reduction in liquidity risk associated with dividend payouts is more pronounced for weakly governed firms and firms with opaque informational environment. Finally, we find that the recent financial crisis led to a greater increase in systematic liquidity risk for firms with no or low dividend payouts.

The collapse of the bubble economy, the decline of the manufacturing sector, the sustained economic downturn - represented most graphically by lower economic growth and higher unemployment - and the fall in trade union membership and coverage have led to changes in the nature of industrial disputes, the way industrial disputes are resolved, and the parties who become involved in disputes. This paper examines these changes with a particular focus on what may be called 'alternative' dispute resolution processes. Fewer mechanisms now exist for disputes to be resolved within the enterprise, and workers are now more willing to go beyond the enterprise to resolve their disputes with management. These external procedures are, in many cases, individual in nature and involve a more legalistic approach to the resolution of industrial disputes. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","alternative dispute resolution processes; collective disputes; enterprise unions; individual disputes; labour relations tribunals","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84857295788"

Exploring contingency effects, we find that, for suppliers who lack R&D, face high competition, are smaller in size, or are less important to customers in terms of sales, such professional ties are more helpful in sustaining such relationships. Furthermore, we find that professional ties also significantly reduce firm risk during periods of market turbulence.

We found that negative experiences with incorporation into US racial hierarchies, immigration enforcement at the Mexico–US border, and profiling as ‘foreigners’ had little impact on their deliberations to return to countries that have become new engines for global growth at a time of US economic decline. Interviewees tended to interpret their experiences as having been mistaken for members of other targeted groups, expected exemption from SB 1070 because of their highly skilled and/or documented status, and lacked knowledge of a now defunct provision in the bill that would have affected immigrants by criminalising failure to carry proper documentation. Instead of immigration experiences or the economic downturn in the US, participants were deterred from return because of perceived deficiencies in their countries of origin, which mitigated the attractiveness of the new economic opportunities there.

Yet, such delivery processes are to happen in light of the increasingly resource-constrained operational environment, where the public purse is no longer available to destinations and destination organisations. This commentary paper provides a discussion on recent transitions in the landscape of destination marketing and management in England, where processes of organisational transformation, the introduction of reshaped DMOs and the public-to-private transition in supporting tourism have been influenced by both the 2010 coalition governments neo-liberal agenda and the global economic downturn disrupting Europe's travel and tourism sector and beyond. The discussion debates the existence of key considerations, which should be taken into account by reshaped DMOs due to their implications for destination management practice. Transitions in the landscape of destination marketing and management in England have indeed contributed to the rise of complex, multifaceted issues and mirror a great deal of uncertainty alongside the introduction and run up of the deemed to be controversial new destination management and marketing structures in England, and as such, they arguably deserve further attention.","Austerity; Destination management; DMOs; England; Tourism policy","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84937397026"

Design/methodology/approach: It identifies the stated purposes of the performance appraisal in multinational corporations (MNCs) and explores the unstated purposes of the performance appraisal, which emerge during performance evaluation and feedback stages. The paper then investigates the different expectations employees and managers have of the performance appraisal and finally examines the changes to these expectations in an economic downturn. Findings: The principal conclusion that can be drawn from this analysis is that there is a weakness in the design and substance of the performance appraisal research. The international appraisal is not exclusively conditioned by culture but also by the numerous contextual-organizational, institutional and economic factors found in the typical MNC. Practical implications: It is suggested that possible strategies could include careful implementation of performance appraisal with attention to both the cultural and contextual environment. It is argued that by addressing both cultural and contextual variables the appraisal will be effective in helping achieve not only the MNC's strategic goals in a time of global economic crisis, but also recovery and survival following economic crisis.

One prominently-published article purports to show that signing on to an IMF structural adjustment program (SAP) increases the risk of civil war, Hartzell et al. (International Organization 64:339-56, 2010). The authors claim that IMF SAPs push liberalization, which hurts people badly enough that they foment civil war. We advance the debate by critically examining their theoretical and empirical evidence, particularly questioning their crucial assumptions about the impact of IMF programs on the economic environment in terms of who actually wins and loses from liberalization and who might be in a position to rebel. Using their data, we find that signing on to an IMF program predicts the onset of a civil war negatively if one uses a lower threshold of 25 deaths when defining civil war. These results suggest that the operationalization of the IMF variable as well as the use of large-scale civil war (1,000 deaths and above) simply capture the effect of ongoing conflict rather than the effects of liberalization. After extending the time period under study and making only minor changes to operationalization, we find that at no time does IMF involvement successfully predict the onset of a civil war. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Civil war; Crisis; IMF; Replication","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84893952209"

The theory predicts that regime elites defect when there are greater opportunities to capitalize on the discontent of other regime elites and voters.

OBJECTIVE We examine the long-term relationship between economic conditions and population health in Iceland, which has experienced some economically turbulent times in the last years and decades. METHODS We use aggregate annual data for 1981?2014. We use three aggregate indicators of economic activity to proxy the economic cycle: unemployment rate, real GDP per capita, and real GDP. Life expectancy at birth, infant mortality, and total mortality as well as four cause-specific mortality rates were used as outcome measures. RESULTS Our results do not suggest a statistically significant relationship between economic conditions and total mortality, infant mortality, or life expectancy. Different responses between causes of death are found, and in some instances between genders, although statistical significance is low. We do, however, find a consistent and statistically significant relationship for females aged 45?64, where economic downturns are associated with lower all-cause mortality. CONCLUSIONS For the time period studied we do not find a significant relationship between economic cycles and population health, where health is proxied by mortality rates, life expectancy at birth, and infant mortality. Further studies using less extreme health outcomes, such as morbidity rates, are warranted. CONTRIBUTION This type of study has not been performed using Icelandic data before and provides a comparison to research from other countries where the relationship has been explored more. Additionally, one of the contributions of this paper is to use a variety of economic indicators as proxies for economic cycles in a study examining their relationship with population health. © 2017 Birgisdóttir & ásgeirsdóttir.","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85041082973"

After some national press attention, this practice became a craze that swept the nation in early 1915. As the jitney experience blossomed into demands for more reliable autobus systems, urbanites began to consider the possibilities of motorized public transit, though they were divided by class and neighbourhood. Suburbanites, however, demanded that cities retool around their automobiles. This article examines the jitney phenomenon as it emerged across the USA, which although handled locally and over varying lengths of time, did lead to a distinct national shift in urban politics and planning. It is argued that the jitney bus was not merely a transition point between rail service and the private automobile. Its real meaning lies in a political shift away from attempts by city dwellers to reform the streetcar trusts, for years a doomed struggle, and toward achieving municipally-owned mass transit through a new technology that was not as expensive or inflexible as rail. Few were satisfied with the jitney when experimentation with it waned in much of the country as quickly as it had appeared. The automobile was not inherently a democratic technology, but the divisive politics it inspired within and between classes in city and suburb developed a tense compromise between private individual and public mass transit that is still a central debate in the nation's cities. © 2006 Taylor & Francis.","","North America; United States; bus transport; transport vehicle; urban planning; urban politics; urban transport","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-33745086589"

Arts graduates play important roles in an economy, through both artistic creation and in careers outside of the arts. While the Great Recession took a significant toll on the US economy generally, arts majors faced additional vulnerabilities as industries that rely on discretionary spending, like the arts and entertainment, are especially hard hit in times of economic downturn. This paper assesses the impact of graduating during or shortly after the recession relative to graduating shortly before this period on educational choices, including choice of major, double majoring, and completing an advanced degree, and career outcomes, including employment status, type of employment, hours worked, and earnings, for college graduates majoring in the arts. Graduating before or after the recession is found to have a negative impact on the share of graduates majoring in traditional arts fields, but a positive impact on the share majoring in related creative fields. Using a difference-in-difference estimation strategy, relative to non-art college graduates, traditional arts majors graduating during or after the Great Recession are more likely to complete a double major, be self-employed, be unemployed, work longer hours, and earn less income than those graduating prior to the recession. These impacts are likely to have a negative effect on the pipeline of college-educated artists working in the arts into the future. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","American Community Survey; Arts; Arts majors; Creative class; Great Recession; Recession","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85114434367"

In addition, environmental protection is becoming more and more important and green manufacturing got an expected practice. Based on those recognitions, in the early stage of product design environmental impacts must be weighted, balanced and optimized against other concerns, such as Life Cycle Costs (LCC), availability, time to market, etc. These multiples and often conflicting objectives pose a challenging and complex optimization problem. Thus, the focus is moved from the single methodology towards the integration and optimization of all of them together. With this aim a new term, Product Life Cycle Optimization (PLCO), has been coined in order to identify those kind of problem.

As a proxy for the level of scholarly advance achieved in these pages, note that the claims of our distinguished contributors can, in the main, be fit into a larger mosaic with little friction between the pieces. It is true that some of our authors blame the crisis on government action while others blame it on government inaction. But the two types of claim are not mutually exclusive. Both action and inaction can be the result of government policy and, for the most part, that is how our authors treat the causes of the crisis: as policy failures, whether failures of action or of inaction. Thus, it may be said that, for the most part, our contributors agree that this was a crisis of politics, not economics. Thus, no contributor argues that the Great Recession was just a normal business-cycle downturn or even a normal popped asset bubble: As Steven Gjerstad and Vernon L. Smith point out in Chapter 3, asset bubbles inflate and burst frequently, but worldwide near-depressions are rare. Obviously the crisis took place within ""the economy,"" but our authors mostly agree that special, noneconomic causal factors were at work - political factors - regardless whether one names policies that backfired (as do the authors of Chapters 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9) or policies that could have been imposed but were not (as do the authors of Chapters 2, 3, 4, 11, and 13). Which brings us to the elephant in the anteroom. Granting that the financial crisis was not a typical economic fluctuation, and granting that both regulatory action and regulatory inaction may have played a role, the intellectually (and politically) important question is whether it was nonetheless a crisis that can be attributed to ""capitalism."" This is the question that interests people around the world who would not otherwise care what caused a given financial downturn; and it is a question that does divide our authors. Yet none of their chapters, which deal with some of the most important individual causes of the crisis, are designed, for the most part, to give a detailed answer to that larger question. In the interest of providing such an answer, this introduction will consider the big picture to which the individual papers contribute, even at the risk of violating Daron Acemoglu's injunction in Chapter 11, echoed in a sense by Richard Posner in the Afterword, to recognize that capitalism is, of necessity, constrained (and constructed) by law. This is undeniably good counsel, but the larger issue raised by the crisis is whether, without close regulatory supervision, capitalism is prone to implode. Clearly this was a crisis of regulated capitalism, but the pressing question is whether it was the capitalism or the regulations that were primarily responsible. Contrary to Posner's implication, I believe it is possible to separate the capitalist and the regulatory contributions to the crisis, just as it is possible to advocate ""more"" or ""less"" regulation of capitalism without ignoring the fact that even ""laissez faire"" capitalism is, at bottom, a system of laws - that is, of regulations.

This paper aims to explain which factors drive public support for cross-national solidarity within and across countries. We argue that the national context in which citizens live affects their preferences for providing financial help to other European countries, and moderates the role played by subjective egotropic and sociotropic economic concerns, ideological predispositions, and Eurosceptic vote choices in shaping public support for European solidarity. Using the original REScEU 2016 survey, we find that subjective economic motivations provide a limited contribution in explaining support for European solidarity, and almost only in countries weakly hit by the crisis. On the contrary, left–right positions, and especially Eurosceptic vote choices, strongly polarize preferences for EU financial assistance, both within and across countries with voters from Eurosceptic parties more(less) likely to support European solidarity in countries strongly(weakly) hit by the Eurozone crisis. © 2022, The Author(s).","EU financial assistance; European solidarity; European Union; Eurozone crisis; International redistribution","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85129076072"

Thus, considering that a Schumpeterian view of economic downturn sees recessions as times where old products/services decline while new products/services emerge, this paper aims to explore the specific innovation-based diversification strategies that matter for the survival of emerging economy VOEs in recession periods to develop new theoretical insights. Design/methodology/approach: The study is based on multiple-case studies of 13 leading VOEs operating in the rural areas of Java Island in Indonesia, an emerging economy. The data was analysed using within-case and cross-case analyses. Findings: Overall, a number of major novel findings have emerged from the analysis, based on which the authors developed several new propositions. First, from the perspectives of both new product and new service diversification, “unrelated diversification” is the primary resilience strategy that seems to be associated with the survival of VOEs in the COVID-19 recession, over and above “related diversification”. Second, from an industrial sector diversification perspective, the most dominant resilient strategy for surviving the recession is “unrelated diversification into tertiary sectors (service sector)”, over and above diversification into the primary sector (agriculture, fisheries and mining) and secondary sector (manufacturing and construction). Originality/value: The authors contribute to the literature on entrepreneurship in emerging economies by identifying the resilience diversification strategies that matter for the survival of VOEs in recession. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","COVID-19 pandemic; Diversification; Emerging economies; Innovation; Village-owned enterprises (VOEs)","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135087746"

It tracks the lives over the months following the start of the economic downturn in September 2008 of ten people aged over 75. In this paper we review our data in the context of discussions of the early 21st-century downturn, drawing both empirically and methodologically based conclusions. Beginning with a brief overview of contemporary debates, we go on to present and discuss our data, arguing the need for multi- and inter-generational accounts in order that the impact of events such as an economic downturn can be understood as variable and interconnected within families and across age groups. Key findings include that apart from increased spending on fuel and food, the oldest generation seem to fear more for younger people than for themselves, focusing on other people's futures rather than their own. © 2010 Academy of Social Sciences.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-77953793596"
